Rec@@ on@@ nec@@ ting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
Con@@ gress@@ men Kei@@ th El@@ li@@ son and John Le@@ wis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
&quot; As go unions , so go mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class jobs , &quot; says El@@ li@@ son , the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota Democra@@ t who serves as a Con@@ gres@@ sional Pro@@ gressive Cau@@ cus co-@@ chair .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m proud to introduce the Emplo@@ ye@@ e Em@@ power@@ ment Act with civil rights icon John Le@@ wis .
This ground@@ -@@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - st@@ opping anti-@@ union forces in their tracks
A@@ men@@ ding the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for eng@@ aging in union organizing to su@@ e for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compens@@ atory and p@@ uni@@ tive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what El@@ li@@ son , Le@@ wis and the co@@ spon@@ sors of their legislation are proposing is as a re@@ connection with a very American idea .
Despite the batter@@ ing that unions have taken in recent years - in Wis@@ consi@@ n , Mich@@ ig@@ an and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to emb@@ race , extend and respect labor rights .
There was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country champ@@ i@@ oned democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same bre@@ ath .
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Dou@@ glas Mac@@ Ar@@ thur and his ai@@ des encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that H@@ ide@@ ki To@@ jo &apos;s milit@@ ari@@ zed auto@@ cracy would be replaced with democracy .
Ful@@ ly aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that &quot; the right of workers to organize and to bar@@ gain and act collec@@ tively is guaranteed . &quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General D@@ wi@@ ght David Eisen@@ ho@@ wer and his ai@@ des urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Ad@@ olf Hitler &apos;s fasc@@ ism was replaced with mus@@ cular democracy .
Reco@@ gn@@ izing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : &quot; The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
Agre@@ ements that restrict or seek to im@@ pair this right shall be n@@ ull and void ; measures directed to this end shall be un@@ lawful .
When former First Lady Ele@@ an@@ or Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t ch@@ ai@@ red the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global co@@ ven@@ ant , Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t and the dra@@ f@@ ters included a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . &quot;
For generations , Americans accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labor rights are human rights .
When this country coun@@ sel@@ ed other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bar@@ gaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
Now , with those rights under ass@@ ault in America , it is wise , indeed , to recomm@@ it to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
As the Re@@ ver@@ end Martin Lu@@ ther King J@@ r. said fif@@ ty years ago :
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not dimin@@ ish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions , labor mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously created a market for industry and li@@ fted the whole nation to und@@ re@@ amed of levels of production .
Those who attack labor forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history re@@ members them .
History re@@ members , as should we .
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protec@@ tions to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long over@@ due .
Kei@@ th El@@ li@@ son and John Le@@ wis are rene@@ wing ide@@ als that have histor@@ ically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
Ju@@ dge temporarily blocks law that could close all Lou@@ isi@@ ana abortion clin@@ ics
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Lou@@ isi@@ ana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clin@@ ics in the state .
The measure , signed into law by Lou@@ isi@@ ana Govern@@ or Bob@@ by J@@ in@@ dal in June and due to take effect S@@ ept . 1 , would require doctors who perform abor@@ tions to have patient ad@@ mitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
However , the judge &apos;s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abor@@ tions while seeking such privileges .
&quot; Pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs will be allowed to operate law@@ fully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , &quot; Federal Ju@@ dge John de@@ Gra@@ v@@ elles wrote in the decision .
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
Ab@@ or@@ tion rights activists applau@@ ded the decision , the latest in a string of rul@@ ings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
&quot; Today &apos;s ruling ensures Lou@@ isi@@ ana women are safe from an under@@ handed law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , &quot; said N@@ ancy Nor@@ th@@ up , president and chief executive of the Center for Re@@ productive Rights , which su@@ ed to block the law on behalf of three of the state &apos;s five clin@@ ics .
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clin@@ ics who were not pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs in the suit and have also applied for ad@@ mitting privileges .
Lou@@ isi@@ ana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling un@@ constitutional such measures in Al@@ ab@@ ama and Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
Key parts of a Texas law that would have sh@@ ut@@ tered most remaining clin@@ ics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday .
Ab@@ or@@ tion rights campaign@@ ers , along with the American College of Obst@@ etri@@ cians and Gy@@ nec@@ ologists and the American Medical Association , say ad@@ mitting privileges laws impose medi@@ cally unnecessary requirements on doctors .
Anti-@@ abortion advocates have counter@@ ed that the measures aim to protect women &apos;s health , though some have also lau@@ ded their effect of sh@@ ut@@ tering clin@@ ics .
Only one doctor who perform@@ s abor@@ tions in Lou@@ isi@@ ana has hospital ad@@ mitting privileges , the Center for Re@@ productive Rights said .
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abor@@ tions , that doctor , f@@ ear@@ ful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
In argu@@ ing against the ruling , Lou@@ isi@@ ana officials said they would not pun@@ ish doctors performing abor@@ tions while their applications for ad@@ mitting privileges were pending .
Del@@ a@@ yed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean o@@ vari@@ an cancer k@@ ills more in rural areas
Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of O@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2007 .
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from o@@ vari@@ an cancer than their city counter@@ parts .
Res@@ ear@@ chers analy@@ sed medical records of more than 1@@ 100 Australian women diagno@@ sed with o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
Le@@ ad resear@@ cher Sus@@ an Jordan , of the Q@@ IM@@ R Ber@@ gh@@ o@@ fer Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
SM@@ ALL ST@@ U@@ D@@ Y : New drugs may slow lung , o@@ vari@@ an cancer
The researchers tra@@ cked the women &apos;s medical jour@@ neys across seven years .
Dr Jordan said a woman &apos;s age at the time of diagnosis , o@@ vari@@ an cancer type , having existing ill@@ nesses and socio-economic status also imp@@ acted on survival chances .
Ol@@ der women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
&quot; This disease is best treated by g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological on@@ c@@ ology sur@@ ge@@ ons and they &apos;re mostly based in major cities , &quot; she said .
Despite improving tel@@ e-@@ medicine services to l@@ essen the ty@@ ran@@ ny of distance , she suggested more fl@@ y-@@ in , fl@@ y-@@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with o@@ vari@@ an cancer was poor , rein@@ forcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The research , funded by the Rio T@@ into Ri@@ de to Con@@ quer cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast m@@ um Eli@@ sh@@ a Ne@@ ave was told that she had an aggressive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
Garden centres rue fall in home@@ owners
The drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of home@@ owners aged under 35 , could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of po@@ unds a year when today &apos;s young consumers reach the &quot; core gar@@ dening age group , &quot; according to the HT@@ A &apos;s study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
According to the report , people r@@ enting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens .
It c@@ ited the rise in people living in highly urban@@ ised areas with no gardens , the popularity of p@@ aving over front gardens for parking and shr@@ in@@ king garden size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
Gre@@ ater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain &apos;s lowest spend per household on gar@@ dening products .
The HT@@ A and Royal Hor@@ ticul@@ tural Society said that r@@ enting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
Gu@@ y Bar@@ ter , chief hor@@ ticul@@ tural adv@@ iser to the R@@ HS , said : &quot; Container gar@@ dening , for example , is especially popular with ren@@ ters who can move their plants when they re@@ locate . &quot;
The HT@@ A report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector &apos;s &apos; golden age &quot; as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-@@ 1990s .
It also predic@@ ted an improved market this year due to better weather following un@@ favourable conditions in March and April last year .
In Pakistan , the protest movement led by political oppon@@ ent , Im@@ ran Kh@@ an , and the spiritual leader , Ta@@ hi@@ ru@@ l Q@@ ad@@ ri , continues .
In the capital city of Islam@@ ab@@ ad , around 1000 demonstr@@ ators stor@@ med the govern@@ ment-@@ run television station , P@@ TV .
However , information minister , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hi@@ d , said that soldiers had been able to force the prote@@ sters back out of the building .
The TV station stopped broadcasting for approximately 40 minutes , but has since begun to broadcast again .
At the same time , around 3000 demonstr@@ ators attempted to reach the official re@@ sidency of Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Sh@@ ari@@ f .
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately one kilomet@@ re away , they clas@@ hed with security security services , armed with sti@@ cks and stones .
The police used te@@ ar gas .
The demonstr@@ ators demanded Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s re@@ sign@@ ation , which he refused .
The Pakistan Army called for a political solution to the conflict &quot; without delay and without res@@ or@@ ting to violence . &quot;
Following a meeting at its headquarters on Sunday evening , the military announced : &quot; The Army remains committed to its task of ensuring security for the State &quot; .
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has taken power by force several times in the past .
The opposition politi@@ cian , Im@@ ran Kh@@ an , acc@@ uses Prime Minister Sh@@ ari@@ f of ri@@ gging the parliamentary elections , which took place in May last year .
The protests escal@@ ated at the weekend , after Kh@@ an and Q@@ ad@@ ri called on their fol@@ lo@@ wers to advance to Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
There were three people killed .
Turkey Sum@@ mon@@ s US Diplom@@ at Over Sp@@ ying Report
The Turkish foreign mini@@ stry has sum@@ mon@@ ed the most senior U.S. diplom@@ at in the country for clarification of a report about American and British sp@@ ying in Turkey .
Dep@@ uty Prime Minister Bul@@ ent said the U.S. charge d &apos;@@ aff@@ aires and Turkish officials had discussed the report Monday .
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Inter@@ c@@ ept said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analy@@ st Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
According to Turkish news wi@@ res , Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ gan down@@ played the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spi@@ ed on each other .
An earlier report that Germany &apos;s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara drew a more an@@ gr@@ y response from the Turkish government .

Mag@@ alu@@ f police chief charged over corruption
The claim@@ ants presented proof of ex@@ tor@@ tion by poli@@ c@@ emen and Cal@@ vi@@ à Town Hall civil servants at Mallorca &apos;s public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday .
The head of Cal@@ vi@@ à police on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by business@@ men and bar owners in the not@@ orious bin@@ ge drinking hot@@ spot of Mag@@ alu@@ f .
Chief In@@ spec@@ tor José Antonio Nav@@ ar@@ ro has been re@@ mand@@ ed in cu@@ sto@@ dy following corruption claims made against him by several business@@ men from Punta B@@ allen@@ a , the street where most of Mag@@ alu@@ f &apos;s bars and night@@ clubs are located .
According to online daily Mallorca Di@@ ario , the claim@@ ants presented proof of ex@@ tor@@ tion by poli@@ c@@ emen and Cal@@ vi@@ à Town Hall civil servants at the office of Majorca &apos;s anti-@@ corruption prosec@@ utor on Friday .
Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Gu@@ ards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be ques@@ tioned by a judge alongside Nav@@ ar@@ ro .
Spanish national daily AB@@ C reported the dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled night@@ club owners as saying favou@@ ri@@ tism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
&quot; It &apos;s not about making money anymore , it &apos;s about survi@@ ving , &quot; one of the business@@ men told the court .
You don &apos;t m@@ ess with our live@@ li@@ hoods .
We have nothing to lose .
Mag@@ alu@@ f made international head@@ lines this summer as a result of a vi@@ ral YouTube video which showed an 18-@@ year-old British holi@@ day@@ maker performing f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o on 24 men during a pu@@ b cra@@ w@@ l .
Island authorities have since attempted to cl@@ amp down on the dr@@ un@@ k and dis@@ or@@ derly behaviour of Mag@@ alu@@ f holiday rev@@ ellers by minim@@ izing numbers on the not@@ orious alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fu@@ elled bar cra@@ w@@ ls .
In addition , the Play@@ house club where the f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while Play@@ house and the bar cra@@ w@@ l organiz@@ ers Car@@ n@@ age were jointly fined € 5@@ 5,000 ( $ 7@@ 3@@ ,000 ) .
The tourist resort of Mag@@ alu@@ f , mainly popular with young British holi@@ day@@ makers , has also seen numerous alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fu@@ elled accidents involving the cra@@ ze known as &quot; balcon@@ ing , &quot; where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool .
First day of spring marked with wet and blu@@ ster@@ y conditions imp@@ acting Adel@@ ai@@ de Airport flights
SP@@ R@@ ING has sprung a win@@ try surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adel@@ ai@@ de Airport .
A further 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9@@ pm , following the 6.@@ 6@@ mm that fell overnight on Sunday .
The latest rain came cour@@ tes@@ y of a couple of short , blu@@ ster@@ y showers , including a bur@@ st that started just before 8@@ pm that dump@@ ed almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.@@ 8@@ C in the city .
The squ@@ ally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Mel@@ bour@@ ne to Adel@@ ai@@ de .
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.@@ 30@@ pm but was hit by wind@@ she@@ ar - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
Wind gu@@ sts were reaching about 50@@ km / h on the ground at Adel@@ ai@@ de Airport at the time .
F@@ light data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.@@ 40@@ pm .
That flight &apos;s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an Em@@ ir@@ ates flight from Dubai and a Q@@ ant@@ as flight from Sydney .
A top of 16@@ C is forecast for Adel@@ ai@@ de on Tuesday , with the chance of a shower or two .
Mat@@ th@@ ies thinks : High time for the Internet Of Th@@ ings
Fac@@ ed with run@@ away advances in consumer technology , which threaten to turn our homes into high-tech control rooms , our re@@ porter , Ber@@ nd Mat@@ th@@ ies , takes heart from one electronic g@@ ad@@ get that he really feels at home with .
As I write this , my eye cat@@ ches the spi@@ ral cable , which connects the hand@@ set to the telephone , and I &apos;m thinking : Wo@@ w ! How re@@ tro is that then ?
But it started me thinking : If the cable was not there , all the hand@@ sets would be lying scat@@ tered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more re@@ tro .
In any case , in the el@@ eph@@ ant@@ ine ( el@@ eph@@ ant@@ ine ?
No - a typ@@ ing error - electronics ) sector , the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rub@@ b@@ ish tomorrow - once bought , it &apos;s out of date .
And anyone , for example , who still has an old CR@@ T TV in their living room , is merely announ@@ cing to the world that they &apos;re not interested in TV@@ s !
So why these thoughts ?
Because the International Consumer Electronics Fair ( IFA ) in Berlin , once again showed us how in@@ competent we are when it comes to questions about technology .
The lay@@ man , who once knew , blind , how to operate a washing machine and a CD-@@ Player , is today faced with high@@ f@@ alu@@ tin expert talk about an array of g@@ ad@@ gets , the purpose of which he doesn &apos;t even understand . &quot; Connec@@ ted Home , W@@ ear@@ ables , Health Care and Ur@@ ban Technologies , &quot; are what the press office promise us .
Yes - and ?
What do you say to people , who clearly talk such gu@@ ff volun@@ t@@ arily ?
Re@@ ally , they &apos;ve been trying to sell us the Internet of Th@@ ings for our homes , for the last 20 years .
So that your yo@@ gh@@ urt can place itself on your shopping list ; so that your fi@@ re-@@ alarm can tell you - when you &apos;re lying on the beach in the Mal@@ di@@ ves - that there &apos;s a fire in your study back home .
And w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if we could set our home air-conditioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ... ?
Yes - but that pre@@ sup@@ poses that you have an air-@@ condi@@ tion@@ er in the first place .
However , one dream really will come true very soon : We lift our w@@ r@@ ist wat@@ ches , and in a loud voice say &quot; V@@ acu@@ um ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum clean@@ er ro@@ bot begins to ho@@ over .
Fantas@@ tic .
Everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution : &quot; The bound@@ ary between white and brown goods is becoming bl@@ urred , &quot; mut@@ ters an industry insi@@ der . You can connect your washing machine to your head@@ phone ; your steam oven can send you a weather report ; and your dat@@ a-@@ go@@ gg@@ les can tell you how long your p@@ izza still has to go in the oven - but that &apos;s of little use if you &apos;re sitting in a traffic j@@ am .
From everyday experience , we also know : If you need a new model g@@ ad@@ get to urgently work , the battery will almost certainly be empty .
Which is another reason why the spi@@ ral cable on the telephone will out-@@ live the next IFA exhi@@ bits in Berlin .
Israeli Children Retur@@ n to School After Gaza War
Th@@ ous@@ ands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Stri@@ p went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shel@@ ters as ro@@ ckets and mor@@ tar@@ s ra@@ ined on their communities during the 50-@@ day Isra@@ el-@@ Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained sh@@ ut@@ tered as the territory recover@@ ed from the fighting .
The start of school brought a sense of joy and exc@@ itement to ro@@ ck@@ et-@@ scar@@ red communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
In the southern city of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees at the &quot; Pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kinder@@ garten , which was struck by a ro@@ cket , removed sh@@ rap@@ nel marks off the walls and sli@@ des ahead of the students &apos; arrival .
&quot; We are a little sc@@ ared but we are exc@@ ited , &quot; said Ron@@ it Bar@@ t , a resident of Ki@@ bb@@ utz Sa@@ ad and an English teacher in its school .
A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
Her 11-@@ year-old daughter , Shan@@ i Bar@@ t , said it felt a &quot; little bit wei@@ rd &quot; to suddenly be going back to school .
&quot; There were some difficult times and we didn &apos;t leave our houses at all , &quot; she said .
President Re@@ u@@ ven Ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ bb@@ utz , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
Until a ceas@@ e-@@ fire hal@@ ted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Sa@@ ad remained in@@ doors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape ro@@ cket and mort@@ ar fire .
Many residents of Nah@@ al O@@ z , a community close to the Gaza fron@@ tier where a 4-@@ year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mort@@ ar shell , are hesit@@ ant about coming back .
The Education Ministry said about a do@@ zen families still had not returned .
Their children have been placed in altern@@ ate schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to study hard and said &quot; we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . &quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-@@ ended tru@@ ce last Tuesday .
The ceas@@ e-@@ fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues un@@ resolved , such as Hamas &apos; demand for the lifting of an Isra@@ el-@@ Egyptian block@@ ade of Gaza and the re@@ opening of Gaza &apos;s air and se@@ a@@ ports .
Israel wants Hamas to dis@@ arm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
The war killed more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians , three-@@ quarters of whom were civilians and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to Palestinian and U.@@ N@@ . estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were milit@@ ants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza milit@@ ants fi@@ red 4,@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ ckets and mor@@ tar@@ s at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
The Israeli military , mean@@ while , carried out more than 5,000 air@@ strikes and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 25@@ 0@@ ,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.@@ N@@ . schools turned into ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters .
With tens of thousands of people still in the shel@@ ters and fighting still ra@@ ging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world &apos;s children and Jewish children , &quot; said Moh@@ am@@ mad Am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
Following the election in Sax@@ ony : CD@@ U Vice-@@ Chairman St@@ rob@@ l questions N@@ P@@ D-@@ bann@@ ing process
In view of the loss of votes by the German right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist party , N@@ P@@ D , in Sax@@ ony , the national CD@@ U-@@ Vice-@@ Chairman , Thomas St@@ rob@@ l , has called for an end of the on-@@ going N@@ P@@ D-@@ bann@@ ing process , which is taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - According to CD@@ U National Vice-@@ Chairman , Thomas St@@ rob@@ l , the current trial taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether to ban the N@@ P@@ D from the political process , should be brought to an end .
According to the &quot; Leip@@ ziger Volks@@ zei@@ tung , &quot; the N@@ P@@ D performed worse than last time , &quot; said St@@ rob@@ l , who is also CD@@ U regional bo@@ ss in Baden-@@ Wür@@ ttem@@ berg .
That is a good development , one that should make us happy , and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the N@@ P@@ D in the bal@@ lot box , and not in the constitutional court .
On Sunday , the N@@ P@@ D narro@@ w@@ ly missed achieving the five percent barrier , which would have seen it enter parliament .
A first attempt at securing a ban of the right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist party failed in 2003 , because the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had inform@@ ants in the top ech@@ el@@ ons of the N@@ P@@ D .
In December 2013 the Bundes@@ rat submitted a further bann@@ ing action to the constitutional court , which is based in Karlsruhe , after spending a long time preparing the case .
The German government and Bun@@ de@@ stag did not take part in the bann@@ ing submission .
Har@@ burg : T@@ ents for new refugees
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es at Ne@@ ul@@ änder Platz will now be accommod@@ ated in t@@ ents .
The reception centre for refugees in Har@@ burg is full-@@ to-@@ bur@@ sting .
The German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go@@ -@@ ahead for the Red Cross to er@@ ect the three t@@ ents .
The local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy .
&quot; These one-@@ off actions only sti@@ r up more doubts in the minds of the public , and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner , &quot; said , for example , Brit@@ ta Herr@@ mann , Chair@@ woman of the Green Party in the Har@@ burg district assembly .
Her party is calling on the Har@@ burg district authority to deplo@@ y empty houses to accommodate the refugees .
96 refugees can be accommod@@ ated in the three t@@ ents .
The reasons for the over-@@ crow@@ ding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help , as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation .
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
H@@ ous@@ ing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a wi@@ del@@ y-@@ wat@@ ched gau@@ ge .
The R@@ P Data Co@@ re@@ Lo@@ gic H@@ ed@@ onic home value index of Australian capital city d@@ well@@ ing prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , R@@ P data said on Monday .
The rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.@@ 2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
Annual growth in prices came in at 10.@@ 9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not even@@ ly spread across the country .
R@@ P Data research director T@@ im Law@@ less said Sydney and Mel@@ bour@@ ne are driving a two tier market .
The R@@ P Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.@@ 1 per cent in the past year , while Mel@@ bour@@ ne &apos;s were up by 11.@@ 7 per cent .
The next strongest markets were Adel@@ ai@@ de , B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e and Dar@@ win , with price rises aver@@ aging between five and six per cent .
At the other end of the scale was Can@@ ber@@ ra , hit by government spending cut@@ backs , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr Law@@ less said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a &quot; real test &quot; for the market .
&quot; Consi@@ dering the ongoing high rate of auction cle@@ arance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it &apos;s likely that d@@ well@@ ing values will rise even further over the next three months , &quot; he said .
In an announcement to the regional German newspaper &apos; die Neue Presse &apos; P@@ ötz@@ l contradi@@ cted the comments of managing director , Pe@@ er Me@@ da@@ u , and said that the latter was be@@ having like a &quot; military general . &quot;
This was not the style of the college , he said .
He said that the Me@@ da@@ u family &quot; were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June .
They are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July &quot; .
At the same time he also said that the plans were not about &quot; final decisions already made , &quot; but rather about &quot; stating preferences &quot; .
He also said that the building work to wi@@ den the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Med@@ aus fe@@ ared .
It was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine met@@ re-@@ wide road .
We currently aim to wi@@ den it by 5.@@ 5 metres , which is one met@@ re wider than before , &quot; explained P@@ ötz@@ l .
P@@ ötz@@ l re@@ fut@@ es the argument of the Me@@ da@@ u concern , namely that its cost-@@ free parking places which belong to the school , will in future only be available for use by the college students .
It won &apos;t be a case of everywhere being par@@ ked up , because we have time to find intelligent solutions , as has been the case with other car parks , too .
Th@@ ink of the neighbours
The children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y Berg@@ wi@@ ch@@ tel , which is situated on the space in question , and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run , is &quot; not to be imp@@ acted &quot; according to the college president .
He is far more concerned to point out &quot; that it &apos;s not only an issue concerning the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y , rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich@@ -@@ St@@ reib@@ -@@ Strasse and the 800 school@@ children of the adjacent secondary school .
It &apos;s therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Me@@ da@@ u gentlemen , &quot; he said .
Whether the criticism by the parents &apos; association for the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y is correct that the extension of the road will lead to &quot; one of the few remaining natural spaces in C@@ ob@@ ur@@ g being lost , &quot; he said the &quot; readers can decide for themselves . &quot;
At the beginning of October , P@@ ötz@@ l , together with the B@@ am@@ berg regional building authority , plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 &quot; and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context . &quot;
Pe@@ er Me@@ da@@ u informed the parents of the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y about the plans , last week .
Accordingly , the access for the new parking level will not now lead , as before , via the camp@@ us and Friedrich@@ -@@ St@@ reib@@ -@@ Strasse , but rather via the Me@@ dau@@ -@@ Berg .
Thus , the narrow road must be wi@@ dened into two lan@@ es over a stretch of about one kilomet@@ re .
According to higher estimates of the Med@@ aus , the traffic in the Ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle park would increase ten-@@ fold .
They are talking of 2000 vehicles every day .
Meanwhile , the town council refused to comment .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f reti@@ res from German National Hand@@ ball team
Hol@@ ger G@@ land@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the German National team .
The 31 year-old from German Bundes@@ lig@@ a side S@@ G Fl@@ ens@@ burg-@@ Han@@ de@@ wi@@ tt said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision .
&quot; It was not an easy decision to make , but I &apos;ve been thinking about it for months .
The time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career , &quot; announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k-@@ Page .
He reti@@ res from international competition with a record of 16@@ 7 national games and 5@@ 76 goals for Germany .
The power@@ ful@@ -@@ thro@@ wing right-@@ back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ League winners from Fl@@ ens@@ burg , and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head coach , D@@ ag@@ ur Sig@@ ur@@ ds@@ son .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f said he had had a &quot; nice long talk &quot; with the Icel@@ ander , who will select his squ@@ ad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland .
His ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me , as I am sure they will also insp@@ ire my long-term te@@ amm@@ ates and my success@@ ors , too .
&quot; I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so , and the double burden of also playing for the national team w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n@@ `@@ t allow me to do that . &quot;
The left-@@ han@@ der fe@@ ared his career might end in 2012 when he had a he@@ el infection .
Due to ach@@ il@@ les ten@@ don problems he was given a cor@@ tis@@ one injection by doctors working with the German Hand@@ ball Association , and this caused severe s@@ well@@ ing of his foot .
He needed an emergency operation and two further sur@@ ger@@ ies as well .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f then brought a legal action against the team doctor ; however , this ended in a settlement .
T@@ welve years as a professional and ele@@ ven years with the national team would take their toll on any player .
&quot; I have some health issues I can &apos;t ignore anymore .
After three foot@@ -@@ sur@@ ger@@ ies within a short period of time in 2012 , caused by infec@@ tions , I have never been able to control my blood pressure .
I &apos;ve also got some other minor issues related - wear and te@@ ar .
At the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head , but I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ `@@ t play tri@@ cks with my body , &quot; he explained in an interview with German magazine Hand@@ ball Time .
He would only consider a com@@ eb@@ ack if really necessary .
&quot; If we are in real big trouble , then I might consider it , &quot; the two-@@ time father told the magazine .
&quot; But I can count the years I will continue to play hand@@ ball with one hand .
And I have to admit that I have become really hum@@ ble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
After my career I would like to walk straight , to be honest . &quot;
Besides the 2007 World Championship he also won the Champ@@ ions League in May and the E@@ H@@ F-@@ Cup in 2008 ( H@@ S@@ G Nord@@ horn ) and 2010 ( T@@ B@@ V Lem@@ go ) .
He also won the Cup W@@ inners Cup with Fl@@ ens@@ burg in 2012 .
German economy as shr@@ un@@ k by 0.@@ 2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have put a cur@@ b on the German economy in the the second quarter .
The Gro@@ ss Dom@@ estic Product s@@ ank from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.@@ 2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter .
This was announced by the German Office for National Statisti@@ cs , which thereby confirmed previous estimates .
Consu@@ mption alone was a sp@@ ur to the economy in the early part of the year , whilst investments were down .
Foreign goods trade had s@@ lowed , too .
Due to the strong start to the year , figures for first half-@@ year GDP were up 0.@@ 8 percent from the second quarter of 2013 .
Hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the destination of &quot; Mün@@ ster@@ land-@@ Moo@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which lead through the city on Sunday .
The city of Hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an invasion of Dutch &quot; Fi@@ etzen ri@@ ders &quot; on Sunday .
The largest cycling federation in Holland , NT@@ F@@ U , st@@ aged the so-called &quot; Mün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de-@@ Moo@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
In other words , the largest bike ride straight through Mün@@ ster@@ land , a bike ri@@ der &apos;s paradise close to Holland .
By regi@@ stering , more than 1000 participants than@@ ked J@@ os ter Hu@@ er@@ ne for having organized this tour through Mün@@ ster@@ land .
The tour was adverti@@ sed in several professional journ@@ als , and offered to those interested .
We are from Den Hel@@ der , and dro@@ ve here over night so we could take part in the tour .
We would also like to get know Mün@@ ster@@ land a bit better in the same way &quot; , the cy@@ cli@@ sts eag@@ erly said , looking forward to the route through Stein@@ fur@@ t , Bor@@ ken and Co@@ es@@ feld .
After regi@@ stering at the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s club house , St@@ a .
Kath@@ ar@@ ina started off with a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city and over the em@@ bank@@ ment , which is also where the start line was .
Then , the route , which was adverti@@ sed in three different categories , headed in the direction of Her@@ ren@@ holz via Schö@@ pp@@ inger Berg towards Co@@ es@@ feld , passing by Ha@@ vi@@ x@@ beck and B@@ iller@@ beck , and then back to Hor@@ st@@ mar .
The ri@@ ders prove just how good a shape they are in : stret@@ ches of 95 kilometers at an altitude of 1@@ 175 meters , 120 kilometers with an altitude of 14@@ 75 meters , and 14@@ 5 kilometers with an altitude of 17@@ 75 meters .
They were fed and water@@ ed on their way back in Ha@@ vi@@ x@@ beck and B@@ iller@@ beck .
Chief organiz@@ er , J@@ os ter Hu@@ er@@ ne , and dep@@ uty may@@ or , Hein@@ z L@@ öl@@ fing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
We are happy , and it was a wonderful experience for all participants .
The organization went smoothly , with no issues , and there were no n@@ asty incidents &quot; , Hein@@ z L@@ öl@@ fing positively concluded with regard to the event .
Unfortunately , there were not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped for , which is pre@@ sum@@ ably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain .
&quot; We shall see each other in 2015 , hopefully with nice weather , on either 30 August , or on another weekend &quot; , the ri@@ ders promised , but whatever the weather , they will return to Mün@@ ster@@ land , and the organiz@@ ers will plan a repeat .
Kon@@ stanti@@ n W@@ ec@@ ker - sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ously honest mem@@ o@@ irs
The 28@@ 7-@@ page &quot; Mon@@ k and War@@ ri@@ or &quot; by Kon@@ stanti@@ n W@@ ec@@ ker , song writer , p@@ aci@@ f@@ ist , political activ@@ ist and ex-@@ prison@@ er , is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a bi@@ ography
Com@@ posed more as a collection of thou@@ ght-@@ provo@@ king ideas rather than a chron@@ ological history , the author , who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947 , has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable son@@ g-@@ text .
And he has been un@@ st@@ int@@ ingly honest throughout : From ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating as a gram@@ mar school pup@@ il to shop@@ lifting and dru@@ g-@@ taking , he has left none of his human weaknesses un@@ told .
And this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so toler@@ ant towards his fellow man .
As a result , abstra@@ ct concepts , which he liber@@ ally uses throughout the text , take on a clearer , more important meaning : Love ; Sou@@ l ; E@@ go ; Exist@@ ing in the Here and Now ; Spiri@@ tu@@ ality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts , in a highly philosophi@@ cal , but also very personal way .
And he explains why he is p@@ aci@@ f@@ ist ; what lies behind his criticism of society ; his political heart and soul ; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and moul@@ ded - not only by music ( he was an opera lo@@ ver who became a soul and rock musi@@ cian ) but by his prison experience , too .
He says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the mon@@ ks , who live their lives by a process of &quot; sub@@ tra@@ ction &quot; whereby they &quot; rid themselves of all things su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
In-@@ between all the high@@ bro@@ w stuff , there are also short an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es of a more ear@@ thy nature - for example , fi@@ st-@@ fi@@ ghts in a bar frequ@@ ented by G@@ Is , or else a cra@@ zy drive on the motorway , in which he dro@@ ve full-@@ on straight into a tree .
And he &apos;s un@@ spar@@ ing also , as he describes that too .
L@@ enny Henry : My father never hu@@ gged me .
Ne@@ ver said &quot; I love you &quot;
Henry was one of seven children born to Jam@@ a@@ ican immigrants in Du@@ d@@ ley in the Mid@@ lands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is re@@ hear@@ sing a com@@ edy , Ru@@ dy &apos;s R@@ are Records , which is based in part on an imagin@@ ary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series .
The sound@@ track is a mix of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p and the tun@@ es are up@@ beat .
But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
There was &quot; a lot &quot; of therapy after his mother died and Henry is refle@@ ctive about his relationship with his father .
He was very un@@ kno@@ w@@ able .
You never saw his face , you just heard his voice : &apos; Stop the noise .
Le@@ ave your sister alone .
Mo@@ ve !
I want to watch the cri@@ cket .
My older brothers Sey@@ m@@ our and Hilton - who were gro@@ wn@@ -up when I was a k@@ id - went to the pu@@ b with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , the beauty of the stro@@ ke in cri@@ cket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
He was this un@@ sm@@ iling blo@@ ke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
Recently Henry opened a found@@ ry in Du@@ d@@ ley and , although conditions were better than in his father &apos;s day , he got a sn@@ ap@@ shot of what life must have been like for him .
It &apos;s a bit bri@@ ghter now but they &apos;re dark , smo@@ ky , Sty@@ gian lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th@@ ine dep@@ ths with bur@@ sts of fl@@ ame and smoke and lots of so@@ ot .
My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you &apos;d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would w@@ ash the found@@ ry off him .
When I wal@@ ked round it , I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estim@@ ation of him went up .
None the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stri@@ pped of par@@ ental affec@@ tion .
My dad never did hu@@ gging , never said , &apos; I love you &apos; .
It wasn &apos;t until my m@@ um was poor@@ ly near the end of her life that we started saying &apos; I love you , I love you , I love you .
Having a daughter of his own , Billi@@ e , with Da@@ wn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
Could you stop with the &quot; I love you &quot; ?
Just stop hu@@ gging me !
D@@ ad , I &apos;m 22 !
With Da@@ wn French .
Why w@@ ouldn &apos;t I be friends with her ?
She &apos;s a great m@@ um
He &apos;s still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
Da@@ wn &apos;s a good person .
Why w@@ ouldn &apos;t I be friends with Da@@ wn ?
She &apos;s a great m@@ um .
Henry &apos;s own mother was di@@ abe@@ tic .
It was one of the things that killed her .
So when I became very , very over@@ weight and started getting di@@ abe@@ tic symptoms , my doctor said , &apos; You &apos;ve got to be radical .
So I went on a big fitness thing , and I also had to go on a dra@@ stic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It &apos;s very hard .
And it &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
N@@ obo@@ dy likes eating car@@ ro@@ ts .
Henry &apos;s change in career tra@@ jec@@ tory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , clo@@ se-@@ crop@@ ped be@@ ard .
Since he won critical acc@@ la@@ im for his O@@ th@@ ello , he has become en@@ gro@@ ssed in the theatre .
Com@@ edy of Er@@ rors followed , as did F@@ ences by August Wil@@ son .
It &apos;s a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ e@@ dies that have up@@ hol@@ stered his busy working life .
He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
A DJ spot@@ ted him on stage doing impres@@ sions and wrote to New Fac@@ es about him .
His TV career was launched in the mid-@@ Se@@ ven@@ ties : &quot; For quite a long time I was the only black impres@@ sion@@ ist / com@@ edi@@ an on tel@@ ly . &quot;
He learnt on the job .
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient jo@@ ke-@@ delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , whilst being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
L@@ enny on New Fac@@ es in 1975
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Min@@ stre@@ l Show , a light entertainment programme in which people &quot; black@@ ed up , &quot; Henry found himself performing his com@@ edy in it for five years .
My family were very un@@ comfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I don &apos;t regret that I did it .
Although it was a wei@@ rd , re@@ prehen@@ sible position to be in , I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd .
But what was an &quot; awar@@ d-@@ winning light entertainment stap@@ le of British television for years and years &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ tes@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
In@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing characters who both lam@@ po@@ oned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative com@@ edy circuit in the Ei@@ gh@@ ties .
The first series of The L@@ enny Henry Show ai@@ red in 1984 , and in the N@@ ine@@ ties he was known as , among other things , chef G@@ are@@ th Black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series Chef ! .
Ad@@ verti@@ sements , docum@@ ent@@ aries , TV series and parts in films consum@@ ed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , L@@ enn@@ y@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv , he thought : &quot; What are you going to do next , L@@ en , because it all feels a bit like you &apos;re marking time or you &apos;re slightly going side@@ ways . &quot;
What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
The first was on Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
I had a real all@@ ergy to Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
I wasn &apos;t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class white people with ti@@ ghts and a cab@@ b@@ age down the front .
So I was very fri@@ gh@@ tened of it .
Every@@ body we inter@@ viewed on that show , Peter Hall , Tre@@ vor N@@ un@@ n , Adri@@ an L@@ ester , Ju@@ di Den@@ ch , said , &apos; You should try it .
Don &apos;t s@@ lag it off if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you &apos;ll understand why we all love Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of O@@ th@@ ello &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was ho@@ oked .
It gave me the feeling that I could do it .
It &apos;s almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
&apos;@@ This is what it &apos;s about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
So the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn &apos;t quite happen .
So@@ on he was star@@ ring in Com@@ edy of Er@@ rors .
Su@@ ddenly I &apos;m at the National Theatre and I just couldn &apos;t quite believe it .
There was one moment where I thought , &apos; O@@ h , you &apos;ve changed . &quot; &quot;
There was a technical fault and Henry inst@@ inc@@ tively felt that it was his job to keep the audience enter@@ tained .
&quot; A little voice inside me said , &apos; You &apos;re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . &quot; &quot;
Instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I wal@@ ked off the stage and something in me went , &quot; O@@ h , thank God &quot; .
It &apos;s not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
&apos;@@ You &apos;re in a play , stay in character . &quot; &quot;
Henry appearing in F@@ ences at the Du@@ ch@@ ess Theatre
Learning his lines for F@@ ences was challenging .
Pan@@ ic &apos;s quite good , it sti@@ ff@@ ens the s@@ ine@@ ws .
That was well received too , so it &apos;s like a big sign from the go@@ ds , saying , &apos; This is what you should be doing . &quot; &quot;
He says this , of course , in a BO@@ OM@@ ING voice .
So I &apos;m sti@@ cking with it .
I &apos;m really lo@@ ving it .
I love being in a re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room .
Henry still has a com@@ edi@@ an &apos;s brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with f@@ las@@ hes of his hum@@ our as he sli@@ ps in and out of impres@@ sions .
I &apos;m just choosing not to do stand@@ -up because that thing of getting instant gra@@ ti@@ fication from a room full of stran@@ gers I gu@@ ess is kind of dangerous .
If you &apos;re constantly seeking that it can lead to a bri@@ ck wall .
I do Live at the Ap@@ oll@@ o sometimes when I want to , but generally it doesn &apos;t flo@@ at my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he &apos;ll ever do another stand@@ -up tour .
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever want to give that up .
So this is his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
It &apos;s good fun .
You &apos;re always telling a story and that &apos;s a great place to be .
I love stories .
People love stories .
Hou@@ th@@ i reb@@ els block roads in Y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital
In the conflict between the shi@@ ite Hou@@ th@@ i reb@@ els and the Y@@ emen government , the Hou@@ this have called for civil di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , San@@ a@@ a .
Hou@@ th@@ i supporters had occupied central roads in San@@ a@@ a on Monday , said a spo@@ kes@@ man of the Hou@@ th@@ i party &quot; An@@ s@@ ar Allah . &quot;
Access to the parliament was blocked as well .
Y@@ em@@ en@@ i media report that there is traffic chaos in the capital .
According to a report in the on-line edition of the newspaper &quot; Y@@ emen Post &quot; Hou@@ th@@ i leader Ab@@ dul@@ mali@@ k al-@@ Hu@@ th@@ i called for these actions on Sunday evening .
The report said that Hu@@ th@@ i threatened further escal@@ ation of the conflict , should his demands not be met .
The shi@@ ite Hou@@ this are fighting for more independence f@@ ro the sun@@ ni@@ -@@ ruled Y@@ emen , and are demanding that the government re@@ sign .
According to the report , Hou@@ th@@ i tri@@ bes have been be@@ si@@ eg@@ ing the Y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for almost two weeks .
Around 30@@ ,000 reb@@ els had set up protest camps on the major access routes to San@@ a@@ a .

Kenya regi@@ sters civil servants to target &apos; gh@@ o@@ st work@@ ers@@ &apos;
Kenya has started biom@@ etri@@ cally regi@@ stering all civil servants in an attempt to remove &quot; gh@@ o@@ st workers &quot; from the government &apos;s pay@@ roll .
Emplo@@ ye@@ es who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
The government sus@@ pects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Ken@@ y@@ att@@ a ple@@ dged to cur@@ b corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
An audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1@@ m ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) a month was lost in payments to &quot; gh@@ o@@ st workers &quot; and other financial mal@@ practice .
The government sus@@ pects that salaries continue to be deposi@@ ted into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC &apos;s W@@ any@@ ama Che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri from the capital , N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i .
All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biom@@ etric registration exercise , a government statement said .
Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the pay@@ roll , it said .
&quot; This exercise will contribute significantly to the ration@@ alization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to clean@@ se the pay@@ roll at both levels of govern@@ ment@@ - hence bring a stop to the issue of &apos; gh@@ o@@ st workers &apos; , &quot; said An@@ ne Wa@@ ig@@ ur@@ u , the cab@@ inet secre@@ tary in the Ministry of De@@ volution and Plan@@ ning .
The scandal surrounding arts advis@@ or , Hel@@ ge A@@ chen@@ bach , will be heard for the first time in court on 11 November .

The news was announced by a court spo@@ kes@@ woman on Monday .
According to the statement of claim , when purchasing the works of art and antique cars , A@@ chen@@ bach con@@ ned them , and invo@@ ic@@ ed Ber@@ th@@ old Al@@ bre@@ cht for more than the actual sales price .
In so doing , the agreed commission also turned out to be more .
A@@ chen@@ bach purchased valu@@ ables for Al@@ bre@@ cht for 12@@ 1 million euros .
Children need roots and w@@ ings
He was a school teacher for 44 years , 23 of which he was the principal .
During his teaching time , Man@@ fred Richter got to know many school@@ children who are now fully-@@ grown adults living in Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen and Kol@@ l@@ bach .
His methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child .
Mount Sn@@ ě@@ ž@@ ka is one of the best-@@ known peaks in the Czech Gi@@ ant Mountains .
Man@@ fred Richter lo@@ ves this painting of a picture from his childhood home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trau@@ ten@@ au / Nord@@ b@@ öh@@ men , today &apos;s Tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
He was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14 , after he had been a secondary school pup@@ il for four years .
One year later the Germans living in the Su@@ de@@ ten@@ land were dispos@@ s@@ essed .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave their home .
After a few months spent in a holding camp , they moved to Bavaria in 194@@ 6 - in a goods train .
That was how he came to live in Sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f , in Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
The teacher training course was in B@@ am@@ berg .
In order to get to the school , Man@@ fred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station ; take the train to B@@ am@@ berg ; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school ; and then make the return journey home .
After two months . Man@@ fred Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cross Home in B@@ am@@ berg , in a sleeping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students .
In 195@@ 1 , he took his first state ex@@ am , and his second in 195@@ 4 , after spending three further years as a teaching candidate .
Since Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia had no free teaching place for him , he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 195@@ 4 at a school in Kol@@ l@@ bach .
The &quot; Young Women &apos;s Room &quot; was his first &quot; Service Fl@@ at &quot; in the school building .
In 1958 , he moved into the new@@ -@@ build teacher accommodation next door to the school , into a three-@@ room service flat .
Man@@ fred Richter bought this house in 1980 , after the school in Kol@@ l@@ bach was closed in 1968 .
Until then , the school district association of Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ aus@@ en-@@ Kol@@ l@@ bach had three classes in Kol@@ l@@ bach and five in Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
In the school year of 1968 / 69 , these classes were accommod@@ ated in Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , in today &apos;s town hall .
When the In@@ der@@ s@@ dorf Scho@@ ols Association was founded , the only school left in the loc@@ ality was the primary school .
In order to avoid a der@@ an@@ king of position in the now smaller school , the then de@@ an , Georg Sig@@ l decided to move to Karls@@ feld - and Man@@ fred Richter became his successor .
However , Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen continued to grow , and so the children and their teachers , from September 1982 onwards , could move into the present@@ -@@ day building , which has since been extended , after Richter took his retirement .
Man@@ fred Richter pra@@ ises the un@@ complicated manner and spirit of gener@@ osity of the then Mayor , Ludwig Gö@@ tz , who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work@@ -@@ room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 exten@@ sions - although the council guidelines governing school@@ -@@ building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work .
&quot; Mayor Gö@@ tz was a great friend of the school , &quot; rec@@ alls Richter , with gratitude .
Throughout his whole career , Man@@ fred Richter never for@@ got a reply given in a speech by a government representative , in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice : &quot; One should never forget to love &quot; . Man@@ fred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
&quot; One has to give children two things : Ro@@ ots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 84 year-old .
But experience has also taught him that : &quot; One doesn &apos;t always achieve that . &quot; Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children , is unclear .
In any case , Richter &apos;s methods were at times un@@ conventional .
If school children got into fi@@ ghts , they were not given pun@@ ish@@ ments like , for example , writing out lines or serving a detention .
At the cost of the council , Richter bought two pa@@ irs of bo@@ xing glo@@ ves , and then let the two an@@ tagon@@ ists fight it out , even if this did occasionally produce a black@@ -@@ eye .
For the benefit of the school , Richter nur@@ tured a good relationship with the then Mayor , Ludwig Gö@@ tz ( CS@@ U ) .
Following his retirement , Richter , who had no political alle@@ gi@@ ances , was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CS@@ U in 1996 .
However , Richter finished in sixth and joined the CS@@ U .

HR@@ 4-@@ C@@ Y@@ C@@ LE TO@@ UR 700 cy@@ cli@@ sts are taking a bre@@ ather in the health resort of Bad Salz@@ hausen and Schot@@ ten
There is nothing particular out of the ordinary about tour@@ ing cy@@ cli@@ sts take a rest in Bad Salz@@ hausen or in Schot@@ ten .
However , on Friday , the she@@ er numbers of those re@@ sting up was striking : The 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour , together with their ent@@ ou@@ ra@@ ges , were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salz@@ hausen , and they would later be attending an open air party in the Al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park in Schot@@ ten , too .
Under the logo &quot; Cy@@ cling and celeb@@ rating along the new@@ ly-@@ discovered routes between Ni@@ d@@ da and Kin@@ zig , &quot; the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vil@@ bel and had listened to a concert there by Van Bak@@ er &amp; Band .
On Friday it was down to business : The ri@@ ders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via Flor@@ stadt to Bad Salz@@ hausen and then further on to Schot@@ ten .
In Bad Salz@@ hausen , the spor@@ ts@@ men@@ -and-@@ women were gre@@ eted by may@@ or Hans@@ -@@ Peter Se@@ um , who had ri@@ dden off the star@@ t-@@ line in Bad Vil@@ bel on his own bike , and the bo@@ ss of the municipal company Bad Salz@@ hausen , Pet@@ ra Schw@@ ing-@@ Dör@@ ing .
All sorts of food and drink had been prepared , to re@@ fresh body and mind : The local women from Ran@@ stadt and Nieder@@ -@@ Mo@@ ck@@ stadt had bak@@ ed 85 ap@@ ple@@ - , pl@@ um@@ - and che@@ es@@ ec@@ akes - as well as stre@@ us@@ el ca@@ ke which the in@@ tre@@ p@@ id ri@@ ders let melt in their mou@@ ths .
&quot; Such c@@ akes only the local women can make , &quot; pra@@ ised the ri@@ der from A@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ eb@@ ach , at the same time as he ordered another sli@@ ce .
At the drinks stand of the Gei@@ ß@@ -@@ Ni@@ d@@ da gy@@ mn@@ asi@@ um club , the ri@@ ders could acquire cold drinks .
The &quot; Du@@ o Bra@@ vo &quot; enter@@ tained the visitors with well-known mel@@ o@@ dies from Oper@@ ett@@ as and Musi@@ c@@ als and re@@ ap@@ ed enthusiastic ap@@ plause .
The lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect .
One gentle@@ man even received a head@@ -@@ massage from his lady partner : &quot; He certainly earned it - after all , he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off , earlier in the day . &quot;
Meanwhile , the may@@ or and the company bo@@ ss still had work to do : They were inter@@ viewed at the foun@@ tain in front of the water@@ ing-@@ hole inn , the Trink@@ kur@@ haus , by re@@ porter , Ra@@ iner Jan@@ ke , and took their radio opportunity to give a big thum@@ bs up for Bad Salz@@ hausen .
Even head of promo@@ tions , Tob@@ ias Ha@@ gen , who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004 , could only get a short rest , as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology .
His pi@@ ck-@@ up truck , in which he used three teleph@@ ones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-@@ strong H@@ essen Police team ; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports , also needed a check .
&quot; The majority of ri@@ ders come from the Rhein@@ -@@ Ma@@ in-@@ Region , &quot; he explained , &quot; but ri@@ ders have also come from G@@ ießen and Ful@@ da , from Lau@@ ter@@ bach or from the Ta@@ un@@ us and even from many towns in West@@ f@@ alia .
The number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay .
C@@ ateg@@ ory 1 ri@@ ders are accommod@@ ated in hotels , with C@@ ateg@@ ory 2 ri@@ ders being put up in host@@ el-@@ style lo@@ dging .
As the ri@@ ders set out again on the road , they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort : &quot; B@@ ye ! &quot;
&quot; It was very nice in Bad Salz@@ hausen ! &quot; they sh@@ ou@@ ted , as they wa@@ ved good@@ by@@ e .
After arriving in Schot@@ ten , the group could take a short rest .
But then in the evening , the ri@@ ders were requested to go to the idyllic Al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
Under the guidance of manager of the Schot@@ ten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing ( GT@@ S ) the Park had acquired a lovely fes@@ tive ambience and , of course , there were plenty of nice ni@@ b@@ bles , such as Fl@@ amm@@ ku@@ chen with well-@@ ch@@ illed Feder@@ wei@@ ßer wine , too .
Ma@@ yo@@ ress Sus@@ anne Sch@@ a@@ ab , GT@@ S-@@ bo@@ ss , Markus Ho@@ ß@@ feld and MS@@ C-@@ Chairman , Wolfgang Wag@@ ner@@ -S@@ ach@@ s , in his capacity as board member of the H@@ essen@@ -@@ Th@@ ür@@ ingen section of the AD@@ AC welcomed the visitors .
The three were vi@@ sibly delighted by the &quot; ro@@ aring trade in Schot@@ ten . &quot;
DJ Tob@@ ias Ha@@ gen opened the dancing stage .
The cy@@ cli@@ sts were happy to have the chance to show off their dancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting fe@@ ats on their bicy@@ cles earlier in the day .
The appeared among the guests an increasing number of local people , who were as attracted by the pleasant atmosphere as much as the mass crowd of ri@@ ders .
On the second day of the tour program , the ri@@ ders would call at the st@@ opping points of Bir@@ stein ; W@@ äch@@ ters@@ bach ; and Bad Or@@ b - including a concert with the Tren@@ k@@ wal@@ dern .
Yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , the spor@@ ts@@ men@@ -and-@@ women arrived back in Bad Vil@@ bel once again .
T@@ ens of Turkish Po@@ lic@@ emen Ar@@ re@@ sted over &apos; P@@ lot@@ ting &apos; against Go@@ v &apos;t
A total of 33 police officers have been de@@ tained in Turkey on suspi@@ ci@@ ons of &apos; p@@ lot@@ ting against the government &apos; , local media out@@ lets say .
Police officials have not immediately comm@@ ented .
Among the de@@ tain@@ ees were 14 high-@@ ranking officers , according to Hur@@ ri@@ yet Da@@ ily News .
Some of them were involved in last December &apos;s corruption prob@@ es targe@@ ting government officials , including four government ministers .
In July a number of Turkish poli@@ c@@ emen were arrested for alle@@ ge@@ dly having set up an organized criminal gang and having ta@@ pped phone number .
Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ y@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ gan ( who was Prime Minister back then ) described their actions as part of activity conducted by Islam@@ ist c@@ ler@@ ic Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gul@@ len against him and others in power .
Not all children back to school in Ukraine
Scho@@ ols across most of Ukraine re@@ opened their doors on Monday ( September 1 ) , after the summer holidays .
The day is traditionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Ar@@ sen@@ y Y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk took his daughter to school .
While there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
The first of September ceremony was not held in every school .
There is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine .
We must fight for a peaceful sky .
The whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian &apos;s people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Ale@@ ks@@ an Past@@ u@@ k@@ ho@@ v , the head teacher of Sla@@ vi@@ ans@@ k School , attended by Y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk &apos;s daughter , spoke in Russian .
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
The first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered shi@@ rts , carrying bal@@ lo@@ ons and giving flowers to their teachers .
In R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC may have found the form@@ id@@ able chief it needs
She comes tra@@ iling clou@@ ds of gl@@ ory from the world of banking , media management and the inner conc@@ la@@ ves of the T@@ ory party .
Indeed , she has had fron@@ t@@ line experience of her own .
Her career began at global management consultants Ba@@ in and Co , then pro@@ gres@@ sed via Morgan Stan@@ ley , Bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , IC@@ I and the media world of Pear@@ sons .
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years , re@@ signing when the top job at its parent company Pear@@ son &apos;s went to a junior male colleague .
Her pa@@ y-@@ off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
Her political rating is stur@@ dy , too .
She was recommended to David Cam@@ eron by Lord Brow@@ ne , the former head of B@@ P , when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whit@@ eh@@ all : she became a cab@@ inet office adv@@ iser .
Her husband is a former T@@ ory coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or .
Back in May , I described the chairman &apos;s job as a po@@ is@@ oned ch@@ ali@@ ce .
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner parado@@ x to its structure .
The trust faces in two directions : in@@ wards as the upper tier of the BBC &apos;s own management hierarch@@ y , but also out@@ wards as the voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go aw@@ ry .
This is an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ opoly calling for complete ro@@ ot-@@ and-@@ branch reform .
But what incoming chairman would risk coming in , cra@@ shing around and disman@@ tling an institution as complex as a Chinese dy@@ n@@ asty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
It &apos;s a difficult call .
If that weren &apos;t tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status over@@ hau@@ led .
As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certain@@ ties , the im@@ min@@ ent negotiation of the licence fee is frau@@ ght with especi@@ al danger for the BBC .
For the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 a year , the British public bu@@ ys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households , and costs each one of them just 40@@ p a day .
What &apos;s more , apparently the Be@@ eb &apos;s popularity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
Pat@@ terns of watching and using the BBC have changed : I receive news head@@ lines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed programmes with i@@ Player .
But it remains a mu@@ ch-@@ loved and form@@ id@@ able institution .
It needs a form@@ id@@ able chairman - I hope it has found one .
Texas &apos; Per@@ ry Sa@@ ys Dis@@ par@@ aging T@@ we@@ et Un@@ authorized
A t@@ we@@ et from Republi@@ can Texas Go@@ v. R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s verified account on Sunday night included a di@@ spar@@ aging image of the Democratic district att@@ or@@ ney who is at the center of his criminal indic@@ tment on charges of abuse of power .
The t@@ we@@ et was later deleted , followed by another from Per@@ ry &apos;s account that disa@@ vo@@ wed the post .
A t@@ we@@ et just went out from my account that was un@@ authorized .
&quot; I do not con@@ done the t@@ we@@ et and I have taken it down , &quot; the later post said .
Per@@ ry ai@@ des did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
Although the t@@ we@@ ets were sent from Per@@ ry &apos;s verified account , it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed .
The earlier t@@ we@@ et posted an un@@ flat@@ tering mo@@ ck image of Tra@@ vis County District Att@@ or@@ ney Ro@@ sem@@ ary L@@ ehm@@ berg , who was convi@@ cted of dr@@ un@@ ken driving in April 2013 .
Per@@ ry v@@ et@@ o@@ ed funds to her office when she refused to re@@ sign , which led to a grand jury in Aus@@ tin this month indic@@ ting Per@@ ry - who is a potential 20@@ 16 presidential candidate .
The cap@@ tion on the t@@ we@@ et reads : &quot; I don &apos;t always drive dr@@ un@@ k at 3@@ x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do , I indi@@ ct Go@@ v. Per@@ ry for calling me out about it . &quot;
I am the most dr@@ un@@ k Democra@@ t in Texas .
L@@ ehm@@ berg &apos;s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Per@@ ry .
It was handled by Michael Mc@@ C@@ rum , a San Antoni@@ o-@@ based special prosec@@ utor who was assigned by a Republi@@ can judge .
Per@@ ry has ple@@ aded not guilty and called the charges a political plo@@ y .
His high-@@ powered legal team has asked the judge over@@ seeing the case to dis@@ miss the indic@@ tment , claiming that the law being used to prosec@@ ute the lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ serving govern@@ or in Texas history is un@@ constitu@@ tionally vague .
Per@@ ry cut off $ 7.@@ 5 million in state funds to the state &apos;s Public Integri@@ ty Unit - which is based in Tra@@ vis County and prosec@@ utes public corruption in Texas - when L@@ ehm@@ berg refused to re@@ sign .
That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-@@ le@@ an@@ ing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
Per@@ ry &apos;s verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes fam@@ ously .
After finishing in fifth place in the I@@ o@@ wa cau@@ c@@ uses during his 2012 presidential campaign , Per@@ ry addressed speculation that he might call it qu@@ its with a t@@ we@@ et of a photo of himself jo@@ gging near a lake , and the words , &quot; Here we come South Carol@@ ina ! &quot;
Ber@@ kel@@ ey says housing market back to &quot; normal &quot;
One of London &apos;s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in sou@@ theast England has &quot; rever@@ ted &quot; to normal levels of activity .
Hom@@ es in the capital have been the subject of re@@ d-@@ hot demand and sur@@ ging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bub@@ ble promp@@ ting the Bank of England to impose limits on mort@@ gage borro@@ wing in June .
Tony Pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of up@@ market hou@@ se@@ buil@@ der Ber@@ kel@@ ey , on Monday said : &quot; Since the start of the current financial year , the market has rever@@ ted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , &quot; adding that this offered a &quot; stable operating environment . &quot;
London &apos;s property market f@@ ared well during the down@@ turn as foreign buyers p@@ iled into the capital .
Prices in the city have le@@ ap@@ t 18.@@ 5 per cent in the past year alone , according to Land Regi@@ stry data , far out@@ stri@@ pping the 6.@@ 7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole .
A@@ verage selling prices on Ber@@ kel@@ ey &apos;s private , affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 at the end of April .
However , a strengthening po@@ und has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deter@@ red by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential &quot; man@@ sion tax &quot; ahead of the general election next May .
London estate agent Fo@@ x@@ tons last week warned that April &apos;s Mor@@ t@@ gage Market Review , which introduced tou@@ gher lending rules , would also spar@@ k lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
Fres@@ h data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mort@@ gage appro@@ vals in July , further sugge@@ sting the housing market is cooling .
Hamp@@ tons International , another estate agent , has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sen@@ timent is already starting to weaken .
Trans@@ action volumes have mean@@ while dropped by a quarter year on year in London &apos;s most expensive post@@ codes , such as Ch@@ el@@ sea , May@@ fair and K@@ ens@@ ington , according to agent W@@ A El@@ lis .
Still , ap@@ peti@@ te for homes in the capital has been a bo@@ on to Ber@@ kel@@ ey , pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.@@ 2@@ bn .
Mr Pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &quot; Dem@@ and for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resi@@ li@@ ent and , reflecting this , forward sales have been maintained . &quot;
In June the company reported it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-@@ crisis peak in 2007 .
Annual pre-@@ tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 3@@ 80@@ m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.@@ 6@@ bn .
Spe@@ aking on Monday ahead of the company &apos;s annual meeting , Mr Pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said Ber@@ kel@@ ey &apos;s earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations .
Analy@@ st consensus is for full-@@ year pre-@@ tax profit of £ 4@@ 50@@ m .
Ber@@ kel@@ ey shares were flat at £ 23.@@ 96 in afternoon London trading .
Nu@@ de photos of J@@ enni@@ fer Law@@ rence le@@ aked online by h@@ ack@@ er
J@@ enni@@ fer Law@@ rence arri@@ ves at the 8@@ 5th annual Academy Awards .
Nu@@ de photos of O@@ scar@@ -@@ winning ac@@ tress J@@ enni@@ fer Law@@ rence have been le@@ aked online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of 100 other star@@ lets .
A representative for the star of &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; confirmed the photos of Law@@ rence were real and bla@@ sted the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; a fla@@ grant violation of privacy . &quot;
The authorities have been cont@@ acted and will prosec@@ ute anyone who posts the st@@ olen photos of J@@ enni@@ fer Law@@ rence .
The photos , which originally were posted on the ima@@ ge-@@ sharing site 4@@ ch@@ an , were pur@@ porte@@ dly obtained through a weakness in Apple &apos;s i@@ C@@ loud online storage system , and a pur@@ ported &quot; master list &quot; of the h@@ acking victims includes the names of doz@@ ens of female stars , including R@@ ih@@ anna , Kim Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an , Mary Eli@@ za@@ beth Win@@ stead and Mar@@ y-@@ K@@ ate Ol@@ sen , according to Bu@@ zz@@ Fe@@ ed .
It is not clear how many of the images are authentic , though &quot; Scott Pil@@ gri@@ m v@@ s. the World &quot; star Win@@ stead took to Twitter to den@@ ounce the h@@ ack as well .
&quot; To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home , hope you feel great about y@@ ourselves , &quot; Win@@ stead t@@ we@@ eted .

Exclu@@ sive extract from Ho@@ ward Jac@@ ob@@ son &apos;s acc@@ laimed new novel about love and the letter &apos; J@@ &apos;
They dis@@ solved , that was the best way of putting it , they gradually came apart like a card@@ board box that had been left out in the rain .
Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious , hard-@@ going , intense , deta@@ ched , and maybe a bit pri@@ ck@@ ly .
And then sh@@ ook his hand .
He recognised pri@@ ck@@ ly .
He was sp@@ iny , like a he@@ d@@ geho@@ g , yes .
The latest cas@@ u@@ alty of this sp@@ in@@ iness was an em@@ br@@ yo@@ -@@ affair that had given greater promise than usual of relie@@ ving the lon@@ ely te@@ dium of his life , and perhaps even bringing him some content .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons was a wil@@ d-@@ ha@@ ired , qui@@ ver@@ ingly delicate beauty with a fl@@ ut@@ tering heart from a northern island village more remote and ru@@ gged even than Port Re@@ ub@@ en .
She had come south with an older compan@@ ion whom K@@ ever@@ n took to be her a@@ unt , the latter having been left a property in a wet but para@@ dis@@ al valley called , fe@@ lic@@ it@@ ously , Par@@ adise Valley .
No one had lived in the house for several years .
The pi@@ pes le@@ aked , there were spi@@ ders still in the baths , s@@ lu@@ gs had signed their signatures on all the windows , belie@@ ving the place belon@@ ged to them , the garden was over@@ grown with we@@ eds that res@@ emb@@ led giant cab@@ b@@ ages .
It was like a children &apos;s story cot@@ tage , threatening and enchanting at the same time , the garden full of secre@@ ts .
Auth@@ or &apos;s view : Ho@@ ward Jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; J &quot; is long@@ listed for the Man Boo@@ ker Prize 2014 .
The short@@ list is announced next week
K@@ ever@@ n had been sitting holding hands with A@@ il@@ inn on broken deck@@ chairs in the long grass , enjoying an un@@ expec@@ tedly warm spring afternoon , the pair of them ab@@ sent@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dly plug@@ ged into the utility console that supplied the country with so@@ o@@ thing music and cal@@ ming news , when the sight of her cro@@ ssed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-@@ forgotten black enter@@ tainer his father had liked listening to with the cot@@ tage blin@@ ds down .
Your feet &apos;s too big .
On account of their inn@@ ate aggressi@@ veness , songs of that sort were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played .
En@@ coura@@ ged to fall into des@@ u@@ et@@ ude , like the word des@@ u@@ et@@ ude .
Pop@@ ular taste did what edi@@ ct and pro@@ scri@@ ption could never have done , and just as , when it came to books , the people chose ra@@ gs@@ -@@ to-@@ rich@@ es mem@@ o@@ irs , cook@@ books and roman@@ ces , so , when it came to music , they chose ball@@ ads .
Car@@ ried away by the day , K@@ ever@@ n began to play at an imagin@@ ary piano and in a ru@@ d@@ ely com@@ ic voice ser@@ en@@ ade A@@ il@@ inn &apos;s big feet .
A@@ il@@ inn didn &apos;t understand .
&quot; It was a popular song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called F@@ ats W@@ aller , &quot; he told her , automatically putting two f@@ ing@@ ers to his li@@ ps .
This his father had always done to sti@@ f@@ le the letter j before it left his li@@ ps .
It had begun as a game between them when he was small .
His father had played it with his own father , he &apos;d told him .
Be@@ gin a word with a j without remember@@ ing to put two f@@ ing@@ ers across your mouth and it cost you a p@@ enny .
It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
He knew it was expected of him , that was all .
He had to explain what jazz was .
A@@ il@@ inn had never heard any .
Jazz , too , without exactly being pro@@ scri@@ bed , wasn &apos;t played .
Impro@@ v@@ isation had fallen out of fashion .
There was room for only one &quot; if &quot; in life .
People wanted to be sure , when a tune began , exactly where it was going to end .
W@@ it , the same .
Its un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability un@@ settled people &apos;s ner@@ ves .
And jazz was wi@@ t expressed musi@@ cally .
Though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sam@@ my Dav@@ is Junior , K@@ ever@@ n knew of jazz from his father &apos;s semi-@@ secret collection of old CDs .
But at least he didn &apos;t have to tell A@@ il@@ inn that F@@ ats W@@ aller was black .
Given her age , she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular sing@@ ers weren &apos;t black .
Again , no laws or du@@ ress .
A compli@@ ant society meant that every section of it con@@ s@@ ented with gratitude - the gratitude of the provi@@ denti@@ ally sp@@ ared - to the principle of group ap@@ titude .
People of Af@@ ro-@@ Caribbean origin were suited by tem@@ per@@ ament and physi@@ que to entertainment and athle@@ tics , and so they s@@ ang and sprin@@ ted .
People originally from the Indian sub@@ continent , electron@@ ically gi@@ fted as though by nature , under@@ took to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
What was left of the Polish community pl@@ um@@ bed ; what was left of the Greek sm@@ ash@@ ed plates .
Those from the Gulf States and the Lev@@ ant whose grand@@ parents ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t quickly left the country while W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , IF IT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED was happening - f@@ ear@@ ing they &apos;d be accused of having st@@ oked the fl@@ ames , f@@ ear@@ ing , indeed , that the fl@@ ames would consu@@ me them next - opened lab@@ ne@@ h and sh@@ is@@ ha-@@ pipe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew de@@ pressed with id@@ len@@ ess .
To each according to his gifts .
Having heard only ball@@ ads , A@@ il@@ inn was hard pressed to understand how the insul@@ ting words K@@ ever@@ n had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
Music was the expression of love .
&quot; They &apos;re not really insul@@ ting , &quot; K@@ ever@@ n said .
Exc@@ ept maybe to people whose feet are too big .
My father never insul@@ ted anybody , but he delighted in this song .
He was saying too much , but the garden &apos;s negle@@ ct gave the illu@@ sion of safety .
No word could get beyond the sound@@ pro@@ o@@ fing of the giant cab@@ ba@@ ge-@@ like leaves .
A@@ il@@ inn still didn &apos;t com@@ pre@@ h@@ end .
Why would your father have loved something like that ?
He wanted to say it was a jo@@ ke , but was reluc@@ tant , in her company , to put two f@@ ing@@ ers to his li@@ ps again .
She already thought he was strange .
&quot; It struck him as fun@@ ny , &quot; he said instead .
She sh@@ ook her head in dis@@ belief , blo@@ t@@ ting out K@@ ever@@ n &apos;s vision .
Nothing to see in the whole wide world but her ha@@ yst@@ ack of cro@@ w-@@ black hair .
Nothing else he wanted to see .
&quot; If you say so , &quot; she said , un@@ convinced .
But that still doesn &apos;t explain why you &apos;re singing it to me .
She seemed in genuine dist@@ ress .
Are my feet too big ?
He looked again .
Your feet specifically , no .
Your an@@ kl@@ es , maybe , a bit ...
And you say you h@@ ate me because my an@@ kl@@ es are too thick ?
H@@ ate you ?
Of course I don &apos;t h@@ ate you .
That &apos;s just the sil@@ ly song .
He could have said , &quot; I love you , &quot; but it was too soon for that .
&quot; Your thick an@@ kl@@ es are the very reason I &apos;m attracted to you , &quot; he tried instead .
I &apos;m per@@ verse that way .
It came out wrong .
He had meant it to be fun@@ ny .
Mean@@ ing to be fun@@ ny often land@@ ed him in a m@@ ess because , like his father , he lack@@ ed the re@@ ass@@ uring charm necessary to temp@@ er the cru@@ el@@ ty that l@@ ur@@ ked in jo@@ kes .
Maybe his father intended to be cru@@ el .
Maybe he , K@@ ever@@ n , did .
Despite his kind eyes .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons flus@@ hed and rose from her deck@@ chair , kno@@ cking over the console and sp@@ illing the wine they &apos;d been drinking .
El@@ der@@ flower wine , so drink wasn &apos;t his excuse .
In her ag@@ itation she seemed to tre@@ m@@ ble , like the fron@@ ds of a pal@@ m tree in a storm .
&quot; And your thick head &apos;s the very reason I &apos;m per@@ ver@@ sely attracted to you , &quot; she said ...
Exc@@ ept that I &apos;m not .
He felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary un@@ kin@@ dness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
Did she think he &apos;d strike her ?
She ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t spoken to him about life on the chill northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she had grown up , but he didn &apos;t doubt it was in all essenti@@ als similar to here .
The same vast and ic@@ y ocean cra@@ shed in on them both .
The same befu@@ dd@@ led men , even more th@@ in-@@ sk@@ inn@@ ed and pe@@ ev@@ ish in the after@@ math of W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED than their smu@@ gg@@ ler and w@@ re@@ cker ancest@@ ors had been , ro@@ amed an@@ gri@@ ly from pu@@ b to pu@@ b , ready to raise a hand to any woman who da@@ red to refuse or twi@@ t them .
Th@@ ick head ?
They &apos;d show her a thick f@@ ist , if she wasn &apos;t careful !
S@@ no@@ g her first - the sno@@ g having become the most common expression of ero@@ tic ir@@ rit@@ ation between men and women ; an anti@@ do@@ te to the b@@ land ball@@ ads of love the console p@@ ump@@ ed out - sno@@ g her first and cu@@ ff her later .
An unnecessary refin@@ ement in K@@ ever@@ n &apos;s view , since a sno@@ g was itself an act of thu@@ g@@ gery .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
He heav@@ ed himself out of the deck@@ chair like an old man .
She felt lea@@ den herself , but the weight of his grie@@ f surprised her .
This wasn &apos;t the end of the world .
They barely knew each other .
She wat@@ ched him go - as at an up@@ stairs window her compan@@ ion wat@@ ched him go - a man made heavy by what he &apos;d brought on himself .
Adam leaving the garden , she thought .
She felt a p@@ ang for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
A man turned from her , his back b@@ ent , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , all the fight in him le@@ aked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she couldn &apos;t recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
Al@@ one again , A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
A score or so years before the events related above , Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 3@@ 2-@@ year-old resear@@ cher employed by O@@ f@@ now , the non-@@ statutory monitor of the Public M@@ ood , prepared a short paper on the continu@@ ance of low@@ - and medium-@@ level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its c@@ ess@@ ation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy expen@@ ded on u@@ pro@@ oting it .
&quot; Much has been done , and much continues to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to so@@ o@@ the the native aggressi@@ veness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those twi@@ sted kn@@ ar@@ ls and narrow cre@@ vi@@ ces of the country where , though the spi@@ res of churches so@@ ar above the he@@ d@@ ger@@ o@@ ws , the swe@@ eter bre@@ ath of human kin@@ dness has , histor@@ ically , been rarely felt .
But some qualities are pro@@ ving to be iner@@ a@@ dic@@ able .
The higher the sp@@ ire , it would seem , the lower the pas@@ sions it goes on en@@ gen@@ dering .
The popul@@ ace we@@ ep@@ s to sen@@ tim@@ ental ball@@ ads , gor@@ ges on stories of ad@@ versity overcome , and prof@@ esses to believe ard@@ ently in the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but not only does the old bru@@ ti@@ sh@@ ness retain a per@@ tin@@ acious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vi@@ cious quar@@ rel@@ som@@ eness in the home , in the workplace , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
&quot; You have an unfortunate tendency to over@@ write , &quot; her super@@ vis@@ or said when he had read the whole report .
May I suggest you read fewer no@@ vels .
Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum lower@@ ed her head .
I must also en@@ qu@@ ire : are you an ath@@ ei@@ st ?
&quot; I believe I am not obliged to say , &quot; Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum rep@@ lied .
Are you a les@@ bian ?
Again Es@@ me prote@@ sted her right to privacy and silence .
A femin@@ ist ?
Sil@@ ence once more .
&quot; I don &apos;t ask , &quot; Lu@@ ther Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz said at last , &quot; because I have an objec@@ tion to ath@@ ei@@ sm , les@@ bi@@ anism or femin@@ ism .
This is a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free workplace .
We are the servants of a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free society .
But certain kinds of hyper@@ sensitivity , while entirely acceptable and lau@@ dable in themselves , may sometimes dist@@ ort findings such as you have presented to me .
You are obviously yourself prejudi@@ ced against the church ; and those things you call &quot; vi@@ cious &quot; and &quot; bru@@ tish , &quot; others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vig@@ our and vit@@ ality .
To still be har@@ ping on about W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , IF IT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to sa@@ p the country of its essential life force .
Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum looked around her while Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz spoke .
Beh@@ ind his head a fl@@ am@@ ingo p@@ ink LED sc@@ roll repeated the advice O@@ f@@ now had been disp@@ ens@@ ing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
S@@ mile at your neigh@@ bour , cher@@ ish your sp@@ ouse , listen to ball@@ ads , go to musi@@ c@@ als , use your telephone , con@@ verse , explain , listen , agree , ap@@ olog@@ ise .
Tal@@ k is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; I fully understand the points you are making , &quot; Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum rep@@ lied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her super@@ vis@@ or had finished speaking , &quot; and I am saying no more than that we are not heal@@ ed as effectively as we del@@ ude ourselves we are .
My concern is that , if we are not fore@@ warned , we will find ourselves repe@@ ating the mistakes that led to W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , IF IT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , in the first place .
Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
Lu@@ ther Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz made a py@@ ra@@ mid of his f@@ ing@@ ers .
This was to suggest infin@@ ite pati@@ ence .
&quot; You go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; in descri@@ bing as &quot; mistakes &quot; actions which our grand@@ parents might or might not have taken .
You go too far , as well , in speaking of them vent@@ ing their &quot; anger &quot; and &quot; mi@@ str@@ ust &quot; on &quot; others . &quot;
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
There was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others . &quot;
It was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know of it .
&quot; In which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; Es@@ me da@@ red to inter@@ ject , &quot; no section of society can claim to have acqu@@ it@@ ted itself well .
I make no accus@@ ations .
Whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
Then was then .
No more needs to be said - on this we agree .
And just as there is no blame to be ap@@ por@@ tioned , so there are no am@@ ends to be made , were am@@ ends appropriate and were there any way of making them .
But what is the past for if not to learn from it -
The past exists in order that we forget it .
If I may add one word to that -
Lu@@ ther Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz collap@@ sed his py@@ ra@@ mid .
&quot; I will consider your report , &quot; he said , dis@@ missing her .
The next day , turning up for work as usual , she was kno@@ cked down by a motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ st who had mounted the p@@ av@@ ement in what pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described as a &quot; vi@@ cious rage . &quot;
Co@@ inci@@ den@@ ces happen .
Les@@ o@@ th@@ o military says no coup planned ; PM stays in South Africa
Les@@ o@@ th@@ o military officials denied st@@ aging a coup to over@@ throw the government , saying they were acting against police suspec@@ ted of trying to arm political fan@@ atics .
Prime Minister Thomas Th@@ ab@@ ane fl@@ ed the country , saying the country &apos;s military had surrounded his official home and sei@@ zed government buildings in the capital of Mas@@ er@@ u .
The premi@@ er took his family to neighbor@@ ing South Africa after saying he received an assass@@ ination threat .
Military spo@@ kes@@ man Major N@@ t@@ l@@ ele N@@ to@@ i said there was not , in fact , a coup , but that the military was responding to a threat from &quot; political fan@@ atics &quot; whom police were attempting to arm .
&quot; What happened this morning was that the command of the Les@@ o@@ th@@ o Def@@ ense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fan@@ atics who were on the ver@@ ge of w@@ re@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c , &quot; he told Vo@@ ice of America .
South African government spo@@ kes@@ man C@@ lay@@ son Mon@@ y@@ ela said the military &apos;s actions had the appearance at an over@@ throw .
&quot; Although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the Les@@ o@@ th@@ o defense force thus far bear the hall@@ marks of a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , &quot; he said .
Les@@ o@@ th@@ o military officials said soldiers returned to their bar@@ ra@@ cks Sunday and there was calm in the capital .
Meanwhile , Dep@@ uty Prime Minister Mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ a Met@@ sing in control of the government in Th@@ ab@@ ane &apos;s absence .
Th@@ ab@@ ane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
Ten@@ sions have been high in Les@@ o@@ th@@ o since June when Th@@ ab@@ ane suspended parliament sessions due to feu@@ ding in his unity government .
He said his actions have not undermined the government , despite alleg@@ ations otherwise .
Eurozone manufacturing at 13@@ -@@ month low
Manufac@@ turing growth in the eurozone s@@ lowed to a 13@@ -@@ month low in August , according to a clo@@ sel@@ y-@@ wat@@ ched survey .
The final Mark@@ it &apos;s Eurozone Manufac@@ turing Purch@@ asing Man@@ agers &apos; Index ( PM@@ I ) di@@ pped to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in August , down from 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in July .
A figure above 50 indicates expansion .
New orders d@@ wind@@ led and factories suffered am@@ id rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
Mark@@ ets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a st@@ alled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of de@@ flation with inflation standing at just 0.@@ 3 % .
There is speculation that ECB bo@@ ss Mario Dra@@ gh@@ i could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative eas@@ ing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis .
&quot; Although some growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ king effect of rising economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , &quot; said Ro@@ b D@@ ob@@ son , senior econom@@ ist at Mark@@ it .
The factory PM@@ I for Germany , Russia &apos;s biggest trade partner in the EU , fell to an 11-@@ month low of 5@@ 1.4 .
Meanwhile , in the blo@@ c &apos;s second-@@ largest economy , France , the PM@@ I fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
France remains a real concern , as does Italy &apos;s des@@ cent from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
Sign@@ s that growth impetus wan@@ ed in the key industrial engine of Germany , and in Spain and the Netherlands too , is also less than re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; Mr D@@ ob@@ son said .
The slow@@ down in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for an@@ alyst@@ s expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented .
One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland , which saw its PM@@ I grow to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
Ho@@ ward Archer , chief econom@@ ist at I@@ HS Global In@@ sight , said : &quot; The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers &apos; survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . &quot;
He added : &quot; Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current hei@@ gh@@ tened geo@@ political tensions - particularly related to Russia / Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
This hei@@ gh@@ tened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled , particularly big@@ -@@ ticket orders .
He said it was looking &quot; ever more likely &quot; that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of Q@@ E , &quot; although we suspect that it will be limited . &quot;
The Bes@@ lan survi@@ vors &apos; decade of hell : Ten years since the horri@@ fic school sie@@ ge , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken ho@@ stage by Che@@ chen milit@@ ants at a school in Bes@@ lan , southern Russia
More than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day or@@ deal that sho@@ cked the world
We went back to Bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room at@@ ro@@ city
Ex@@ ac@@ tly a decade after the appalling Bes@@ lan school sie@@ ge in which 3@@ 34 per@@ ished , including 18@@ 6 children , the hero@@ ic survi@@ vors warned last night of a new apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se in Ukraine .
When fan@@ atic Islamic terrorists ki@@ dn@@ apped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the n@@ adi@@ r of all evil .
The tragedy united east and west in re@@ vul@@ sion , which amaz@@ ingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the dire@@ st mis@@ ery .
Ten years on , we went back to Bes@@ lan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room at@@ ro@@ city .
We discovered amazing young people , who have de@@ fied ad@@ versity , though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever .
Their greatest hope ?
That the war now scar@@ ring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
The girl pic@@ tured trying to climb back inside the bli@@ tz@@ ed school gym
She was fam@@ ously sn@@ apped by top Russian photographer D@@ mit@@ ry Be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov wearing only her under@@ wear as tried to climb back inside the bli@@ tz@@ ed school gym after a mine explo@@ ded .
Be@@ wil@@ dered , A@@ ida was desper@@ ately searching for her mother , Lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 .
Both were fe@@ ared dead , but in fact they survi@@ ved .
&apos;@@ A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn &apos;t , &apos; said A@@ ida at the time .
My legs were covered in blood .
I got up and clim@@ bed back in to look for my m@@ um .
A soldi@@ er plu@@ cked her to safety .
After a series of sur@@ ger@@ ies , she thought she had totally recover@@ ed but said yesterday : &apos; Three months ago , the pain came back .
I fear I may need more surgery .
Some sh@@ rap@@ nel pieces are still in my kne@@ e .
Her aim now is to become a denti@@ st , to help people as she has been ai@@ ded by medi@@ cs .
&apos;@@ This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , &apos; she said de@@ fi@@ antly .
&apos;@@ It happened to me and you can &apos;t change this fact .
Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too much .
My best friend and my class@@ mat@@ e-@@ to-@@ be D@@ zer@@ a Ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
We played together when we were small and dre@@ amed of going to school together .
&apos;@@ I don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I will think about a family later .
She says the sie@@ ge remains with her though memories fade a little each year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troub@@ les and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I see online the photogra@@ ph of me climbing into the school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
The boy who fl@@ ed through a ha@@ il of bul@@ lets belie@@ ving his mother to be dead
He was on his first day at school ( Russians start school aged 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three day sie@@ ge hu@@ gging his m@@ um Tam@@ ara .
Then seven he said : &apos; M@@ um@@ my told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand . &apos; 
After one explosion he thought she was dying .
She told him : &apos; R@@ un &apos; .
F@@ ear@@ ing she was dead , he fl@@ ed and on his way he saw a cr@@ ying to@@ dd@@ ler , gra@@ b@@ bed the child by the hand , and fl@@ ed through a ha@@ il of bul@@ lets .
His dad V@@ ladimir , who sco@@ op@@ ed up his son outside , said : &apos; Dam@@ ir told me his mother had died .
He said : &apos; I couldn &apos;t save her &apos; . &apos; 
In fact , Tam@@ ara had st@@ umb@@ led free and was in hospital with leg wo@@ unds , in turn belie@@ ving her son had per@@ ished .
After their re@@ union she said : &apos; I we@@ pt with joy .
I couldn &apos;t believe it .
He ran in and hu@@ gged me .
Dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to London ( by the now de@@ fun@@ ct News of the World newspaper ) to be cro@@ wn@@ ed a Bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion by then premi@@ er Tony Blair and wife wife Cher@@ ie .
&apos;@@ This hor@@ ror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop rec@@ alling it , &apos; he said yesterday .
Still I can say that in my mind it is f@@ ading .
I remember right afterwards , I thre@@ w away all my to@@ y g@@ uns .
But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me .
&apos;@@ I &apos;m not sc@@ ared to go back in the gym but I don &apos;t think about myself .
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out .
We never say they were killed or dead .
We say they stayed in the gym .
I remember my trip to London so well , specially the to@@ y shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted , and riding in an open top car .
But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of mis@@ ery he and his friends suffered .
This hor@@ ror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop rec@@ alling it
&apos;@@ I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these hor@@ rors , &apos; said Dam@@ ir , who was last week doing voluntary work at a nun@@ n@@ ery .
I want to help so much .
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they en@@ rol me to the training ac@@ ade@@ my next year .
His mother Tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &apos; 37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
I remember terrible silence right after the sie@@ ge , there were just no children to sh@@ out and run around , and that silence la@@ sted for many months .
She vi@@ vi@@ dly rec@@ alls her trip with Dam@@ ir to London .
People in London were cr@@ ying when I told our story .
I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , can show their support .
She was grateful to &apos; Cher@@ ie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cher@@ ie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London , and how that helped Dam@@ ir and me .
I remember when Dam@@ ir wanted to eat bor@@ sch sou@@ p , they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , Dam@@ ir was shooting at them from his water pist@@ ol and they ran away and played with him .
And we were just one month away from our hor@@ ror then .
I was amaz@@ ed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
She said : &apos; I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
Now in Ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and I believe many children were killed and will be killed .
They are just the same children , like ours .
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bo@@ red or busy with something else .
I just know what those people feel , the hor@@ ror of it .
And I can &apos;t stop feeling it .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
Dam@@ ir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy , he is not at all aggressive or an@@ gr@@ y .
He is not seeking re@@ ven@@ ge for example , he is not pre@@ occupied with this past hor@@ ror .
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six class@@ m@@ ates and they go to the gym from time to time and light cand@@ les there .
When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he thre@@ w away all his g@@ uns and other arm@@ y-@@ type to@@ y@@ s.@@ Dam@@ ir is 17 now , t@@ aller than me , nice looking , cle@@ ver and healthy .
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I &apos;d never see him again .
When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around , I saw the hell around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survi@@ ved in this hell .
&apos;@@ I remember I was sh@@ ou@@ ting to him &apos; Dam@@ ir , run , run away &apos; but again I was so sure he had not heard me .
But he did hear , and he did run away .
So life goes on for us unlike for so many .
Geor@@ gy I@@ ly@@ in , 17
The boy whose sho@@ cking image after the sie@@ ge came to define the hor@@ ror of Bes@@ lan
Comfort : Bes@@ lan survi@@ vor Geor@@ gy I@@ ly@@ in with his m@@ um F@@ ati@@ ma after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , while on the right is Geor@@ gy today
His bloo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined face was et@@ ched with fear as he ran for his life as Che@@ chen terrorists gun@@ ned down his class@@ m@@ ates .
His picture was one of the most sho@@ cking symbols of the bar@@ bar@@ ity at Bes@@ lan .
His mother F@@ ati@@ ma , 54 , a senior GP , had dropped him for his first day at school before rus@@ hing to take her el@@ der son V@@ ladimir to university .
&apos;@@ I left two minutes before the terrorists rus@@ hed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of hor@@ ror , &apos; she rec@@ alled .
Not completely alone , we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed .
Only my Geor@@ gy managed to survive .
The closer this date is , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
We do not feel it was long ago , I think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
N@@ obo@@ dy will ever forget , I promise you .
Ha@@ un@@ ting : The image of Geor@@ gy ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and has been imm@@ or@@ tali@@ sed in a stat@@ ue ( right )
I remember Geor@@ gy so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV .
And now there is even a stat@@ ue to cr@@ ying Geor@@ gy in San Mar@@ ino .
Geor@@ gy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the book@@ case in our home .
I understand , but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
Geor@@ gy says now : &apos; It &apos;s important this can never happen again .
&apos;@@ I doubt we &apos;ll ever know the truth .
People keep investig@@ ating such trage@@ dies and never know the truth .
Now they are investig@@ ating this Bo@@ eing crash in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is moving to something very bad .
&apos;@@ I can &apos;t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-@@ one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
Ten years is nothing for such pain .
We need doz@@ ens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
It affected my health and I still feel it .
For about three or four years I had some night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge but then it got better .
I got back to school later in 2004 , I was very sc@@ ared every day .
I was thinking about my friends and class@@ m@@ ates who were killed .
This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it .
I do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself .
My life goes on .
I finished school this year entered a medical university in V@@ ladi@@ k@@ av@@ ka@@ z .
I will learn to be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
My first choice was to go in the army .
I wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .
Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ ye@@ v , 20
The boy who survi@@ ved despite having been tra@@ pped at the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist
Mira@@ cul@@ ous : Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ ye@@ v was tra@@ pped at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist during the sie@@ ge but still managed to survive
As the sie@@ ge was under@@ way , he was pic@@ tured tra@@ pped inside the gym , sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
It is truly a mi@@ racle he was not killed .
&apos;@@ We feel as if it was just yesterday , &apos; said Geor@@ gy , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FS@@ B , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the sie@@ ge .
It is still with me , this is not something I left behind .
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true .
&apos;@@ In 2006 I worked with psych@@ ologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can &apos;t forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again .
I lost consciousness .
I would never ever go there again and please don &apos;t ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture .
Sur@@ vi@@ vor : Geor@@ gy Far@@ nie@@ v pic@@ tured today , with a photogra@@ ph of him in hospital fol@@ l@@ wo@@ ing the sie@@ ge on his laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
In terms of physical condition I am well .
I should be careful with my kne@@ e which was injured but I walk fine now .
Still my health did not let me go and study in FS@@ B secret service ac@@ ade@@ my in St Petersburg as I wanted .
I sent my documents , including medical papers , and they rep@@ lied it was not possible .
My second passion was animals , so I went to the veter@@ inary institute .
I have completed two years there .
He is learning to treat all animals &apos; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &apos; .
He said : &apos; I know I would never tell my children about my experience .
This is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : &apos; This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
I will go and attend cerem@@ on@@ ies being held to mark it .
I know Geor@@ gy won &apos;t go .
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not .
I was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me@@ .@@ Here in Bes@@ lan the im@@ print is on everyone .
It stays with us .
Geor@@ gy is an adult now but that hor@@ ror is still with him .
It is hard to accept it when something so terri@@ bly unfair happens to you .
He is a boy , he likes sports but he can &apos;t take part because of his kne@@ e .
He had several sur@@ ger@@ ies , he walks but cannot exercise .
I would say he 50 % over@@ came this hor@@ ror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
This horri@@ ble experience will stay with us .
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the sie@@ ge , and it only adds to my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me .
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
I know families where new children were born , but also wi@@ dows who never married again .
It is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget my heart j@@ umping out of my ch@@ est at the moment I saw him in hospital .
Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
What are those people fighting for ?
Why are they killing each other ?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it .
We used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed .
If we could only gra@@ b all the reb@@ els and throw them away - as far away as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and video
If you &apos;re interested in shooting photos or video under@@ water , you have a variety of equipment choices .
The che@@ ap@@ est option is a water@@ proof poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ shoot , such as the Nikon Co@@ ol@@ pi@@ x A@@ W@@ 120 or an action cam , such as the Go@@ Pro Her@@ o@@ 3 + Silver Edition , which both go for around $ 300 .
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all priced under $ 350 .
No matter what gear you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
Dou@@ ble-@@ check your gear .
Even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the camera &apos;s battery and other com@@ partments are tigh@@ tly closed .
Also , set your camera to match the type of photos or video you &apos;ll be shooting .
Some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for di@@ m under@@ sea settings .
And before you jump in , know how deep your equipment can go .
Some cameras are rated to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
Check out our buying guide and Rat@@ ings for digital cameras for both conventional and water@@ proof models .
Take multiple shots - because many of them won &apos;t work .
Po@@ int-@@ and-@@ shoot cameras have L@@ CDs to help you com@@ pose photos , while action cam@@ s generally don &apos;t .
Even if you have an LCD , it &apos;s going to hard to see it under@@ water , and com@@ posing your shot will be a hit@@ -@@ or-@@ miss process .
So shoot multi@@ ples .
Also , if your camera has a bra@@ cket mode , which sho@@ ots a bur@@ st of shots at slightly different exposure settings , take advantage of it .
Stay near the surface .
Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive under@@ water .
If possible , stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool , a lake or the ocean .
This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you &apos;ll see .
Get close to your subjects .
This is great advice for shooting on dry land , but it is even more important under@@ water because of the di@@ m lighting conditions .
It &apos;s particularly important if you &apos;re shooting with an action cam : These devices often have a fixed , wide angle lens , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
Andrew Law@@ son was the kind of man whose force of personality could sha@@ ke things up , even in a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an organisation like the N@@ HS .
A consul@@ tant an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ st , he devoted his career to spar@@ ing the sick both the ag@@ on@@ ies of illness and the tor@@ ments of treatment .
Among those who sought him out , his wife re@@ members , was an MI@@ 6 officer who had to live with the crip@@ pling after@@ -@@ effects of torture .
Law@@ son understood that while doctors are cap@@ tiv@@ ated by diagno@@ ses and diseases , those being treated are overwhel@@ m@@ ingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
&quot; I have not felt myself , &quot; he wrote in May that year .
I &apos;ve had difficulty in energ@@ ising myself .
Stru@@ ggling with flu@@ -@@ like symptoms , he found himself imp@@ ati@@ ently ber@@ ating his wife , Ju@@ lie@@ t .
&quot; I want everything to happen sooner rather than later , &quot; he noted .
When Ju@@ lie@@ t went away on business for a week , Law@@ son found himself un@@ usually , and un@@ accoun@@ t@@ ably , up@@ set .
Some@@ thing was up .
He got a colleague to perform a ch@@ est X-@@ ray .
Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps .
The results of the X-@@ ray came back .
He had mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma , an inc@@ u@@ rable cancer that affects the ple@@ ura , or lining of the lung .
With most can@@ c@@ ers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
Though some smo@@ kers get lung cancer , for example , not all lung cancer suff@@ er@@ ers have smo@@ ked .
But mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma is different .
In almost every case , the cause is exposure to as@@ best@@ os - a fi@@ bro@@ us building material once du@@ b@@ bed &quot; mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; but now known to be mort@@ ally dangerous .
For most of us , mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma has been an easy disease to ignore .
As@@ best@@ os , after all , is a product of the past .
The most dangerous type of as@@ best@@ os has not been used in Britain since the 196@@ 0s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
Even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe lag@@ gers , buil@@ ders , car@@ pen@@ ters and ship@@ yard workers , for example .
An industrial tox@@ in from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
But such com@@ plac@@ ency is mis@@ placed .
Britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma epide@@ mic .
There are more mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
With an annual toll of about 2,@@ 500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
Mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma annual deaths since 1980 and projec@@ ted future deaths in Great Britain
The reason that we are feeling its dead@@ ly effects now is that , though as@@ best@@ os use has been illegal for years ( all types of as@@ best@@ os were eventually banned by law in 1999 ) , it usually takes decades for mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma to develop .
And the mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma sc@@ our@@ ge is not confined to veter@@ ans of industrial building jobs .
As@@ best@@ os has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educated in , and the stores we shop in .
As a result , mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma is no respec@@ ter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
The bas@@ tions of privilege , from smart London department stores to public schools , have proved no refuge .
The Hou@@ ses of Parliament are ri@@ dd@@ led with as@@ best@@ os .
Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reser@@ vo@@ irs of this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
Andrew Law@@ son was not old .
Nor was he a pipe lag@@ ger .
In fact , he stru@@ gg@@ led to think where he might have come into contact with as@@ best@@ os .
Then he put his finger on it .
&quot; It seems that there may have been a lot of as@@ best@@ os in the tun@@ nels at Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital where I spent six years training , &quot; he wrote .
Every@@ body - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and por@@ ters - used the tun@@ nels .
One wonder@@ s how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will get the same disease ?
It was a question to which , s@@ adly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
&quot; Of four doctors who trained at Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital and who subsequently developed mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma in the past five years , &quot; he noted in a letter in 2010 , &quot; I am the only one left alive . &quot;
How many of us will get this disease ?
Andrew Law@@ son was diagno@@ sed with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma when he was 48 .
When he died , on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
To survive so long is unusual .
Fif@@ ty per cent of mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers are dead 8 months after diagnosis .
It is always fat@@ al .
So now we can only echo Law@@ son &apos;s question : &quot; How many of us will get the same disease ? &quot;
According to Britain &apos;s leading expert on mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma , Professor Ju@@ lian Pe@@ to , our best gu@@ ess is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the as@@ best@@ os epide@@ mic in Britain should have played itself out , some 90@@ ,000 people will have died .
Most currently have no idea that they will die this way .
An as@@ best@@ os mine in Que@@ bec , Canada Al@@ am@@ y
A quick gl@@ ance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the sc@@ our@@ ge of mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma has spread .
This June , for example , Mark@@ s &amp; Spen@@ cer admitted neg@@ lig@@ ently ex@@ posing Jan@@ ice Al@@ len to as@@ best@@ os .
She worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , super@@ vising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flag@@ ship store on Oxford Street .
Mrs Al@@ len was only 18 when she started working at M &amp; S .
Now she has two children in their 20@@ s .
&quot; Before this happened , &quot; she says , &quot; I had never heard of mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma , I barely knew about as@@ best@@ os .
I never would have dre@@ amed that I would be affected by it .
Fe@@ w people do know much about as@@ best@@ os .
In fact , as@@ best@@ os describes not one substance but a group of six miner@@ als .
They get their name from the word &quot; as@@ besti@@ form &quot; - which describes the fi@@ bro@@ us structure which en@@ dows them with strength and flexibility .
Of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
Chr@@ y@@ so@@ tile , commonly known as White As@@ best@@ os , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
It was used in ro@@ o@@ fing panels , floor tiles , pipe insul@@ ation , bo@@ iler se@@ als , even bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
It is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ best@@ os , but it &apos;s still considered a &quot; major health haz@@ ard &quot; that can kill by the EU and WHO .
More dangerous , however , are Brown As@@ best@@ os ( am@@ o@@ site ) and Blue As@@ best@@ os ( cro@@ ci@@ do@@ li@@ te ) .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest impor@@ ter of Brown As@@ best@@ os , and experts suggest that &quot; there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniqu@@ ely high mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma rate &#91; in the UK &#93; . &quot;
A Mark@@ s &amp; Spen@@ cer employee was exposed to as@@ best@@ os at its flag@@ ship store in Oxford Street , London Al@@ am@@ y
Jan@@ ice Al@@ len may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma , but Ju@@ lian Pe@@ to &apos;s work suggests that her story is far from un@@ common .
He has produced a study of suff@@ er@@ ers which suggests that &quot; a substantial proportion of mes@@ othe@@ li@@ omas with no known occup@@ ational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental as@@ best@@ os exposure . &quot;
Much of that exposure , he says , is due to &quot; normal occupation and we@@ a@@ ther@@ ing &quot; of our buildings .
No one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
A report from Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d Consulting , which looked at the Palace of West@@ min@@ ster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed un@@ awa@@ res .
In 2009 Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d reported that service sha@@ fts and pi@@ ping duc@@ ts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contam@@ inated with as@@ best@@ os , whose le@@ th@@ al fi@@ b@@ res could be distur@@ bed by something as inno@@ cu@@ ous as &quot; strong curr@@ ents of air . &quot;
MP@@ s are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
While the Parliamentary Works Services Direc@@ torate insi@@ sted that the Palace of West@@ min@@ ster had been given &quot; a clean bill of health , &quot; it is now accepted £ 1@@ bn of work lasting several years is required to over@@ hau@@ l Parliament , upgra@@ ding electri@@ cs and removing as@@ best@@ os , and that after the 2015 general election MP@@ s may sit in the nearby Q@@ E@@ 2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Ben@@ ches at West@@ min@@ ster .
The Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d report noted that &quot; the presence of as@@ best@@ os has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . &quot;
It is impossible to know if this mis@@ management will cost lives .
All anyone can do now is wait .
One person who has never been able to pin@@ point his exposure to as@@ best@@ os is Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t , a GP .
Like Andrew Law@@ son , Ab@@ bot@@ t , 50 , sus@@ pects that he was exposed to as@@ best@@ os while working in hospitals .
&quot; I have worked at a hospital where positive as@@ best@@ os claims have been made , &quot; he says , &quot; But I can &apos;t prove it in my case .
It &apos;s so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
What he re@@ members clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fe@@ ver .
He was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening surgery .
Su@@ ddenly I started feeling shi@@ very .
It came on very quickly .
I felt d@@ read@@ ful .
I didn &apos;t think I was going to be able to drive all the way home .
Being a doctor , Ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was coming from the ple@@ ura , the lining around his l@@ ungs .
But like Jan@@ ice Al@@ len , he simply had no reason to suspect mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma .
He ended up spending a month off work .
Pu@@ zz@@ led doctors gave him ch@@ est X-@@ rays , and administ@@ ered ple@@ ural ca@@ the@@ ters to draw off flu@@ id from the l@@ ungs and send it for assessment .
Yet the condition went un@@ diagno@@ sed .
S@@ low@@ ly his health improved and he went back to work .
But from time to time the same symptoms returned , often after he took exercise and was brea@@ thing hard .
In 2011 , one of Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s patients arrived at his GP &apos;s surgery with similar symptoms to him , and was subsequently diagno@@ sed with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma .
But even then Ab@@ bot@@ t didn &apos;t make the connection with his own case .
After all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly as@@ best@@ os .
The link in that case was clear .
In September 2011 , Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s condition wor@@ sen@@ ed again , and his consul@@ tant took his C@@ T sc@@ ans and X-@@ rays to a panel of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Ab@@ bot@@ t started feeling un@@ well , a probe , equipped with a camera , was fed into the c@@ av@@ ity between the lining of his ch@@ est and the lining of his lung .
I &apos;m an optim@@ ist .
I tend just to plo@@ d along , &quot; he says .
I ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t worried about it too much to be honest .
But R@@ ach@@ el , my wife , was worrying .
The result of the bi@@ op@@ sy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : &quot; I was told it was mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma . &quot;
Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sed with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma
Su@@ ddenly Ab@@ bot@@ t was pl@@ ung@@ ed into meetings with Mac@@ m@@ ill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer .
That was when he realised the scale of the epide@@ mic .
&quot; It turns out that as@@ best@@ os was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had as@@ best@@ os lag@@ ging on the pi@@ pes , &quot; he says .
People who were exposed to as@@ best@@ os in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
So mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma is now affecting younger people not in the typical prof@@ essions .
The most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s-@@ lag@@ ged pi@@ pes in hospitals were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
But many staff , walking in pedestrian tun@@ nels to get from one building to another ( like Andrew Law@@ son ) , or eating in bas@@ ement can@@ te@@ ens ( as Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t frequently did ) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance .
For several decades after the war , it turns out , hospitals were potentially life-@@ saving places for patients , but life-@@ threatening places for the doctors who treated them .
It is still being removed today .
P@@ up@@ ils per@@ ched their Bun@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ best@@ os mat@@ s
And it is not just hospitals .
As@@ best@@ os was frequently used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls for its marvell@@ ous insul@@ ating and fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ ding properties .
Scho@@ ols too .
In fact many people will have been first exposed to as@@ best@@ os in the class@@ room .
Up and down the country , in my@@ ri@@ ad chem@@ istry lessons , pupils have per@@ ched their Bun@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ best@@ os mat@@ s .
Websites have sprung up to address the issue of as@@ best@@ os in schools .
Meanwhile , in our homes , items as inno@@ cu@@ ous as floor tiles or shed ro@@ o@@ fs have rout@@ inely contained as@@ best@@ os .
&quot; It &apos;s an industrial po@@ ison built into large amounts of our housing stock , &quot; notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Law@@ son in his case against Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital .
In one case the only contact the woman suff@@ erer could think of was pul@@ ling down a garden shed in the 1970s .
So be careful how you pull down the garden shed .
The impact of diagnosis , knowing that the disease is inc@@ u@@ rable , is huge .
&quot; It takes a while to s@@ ink in , &quot; says Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t .
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn &apos;t concentrate on what I was doing .
I was at the surgery for two weeks .
Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out .
Well , I won &apos;t see Christmas again
One of the har@@ dest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
Like countless patients before him , he re@@ members feeling be@@ wil@@ dered by the amount of information to get to gri@@ ps with .
&quot; It was hard to take everything in , &quot; he says .
&quot; I asked my consul@@ tant &quot; How long do I have ? &quot;
I was quoted about 12 months .
I remember thinking &quot; Well , I won &apos;t see Christmas again .
That &apos;s it . &quot; &quot;
Mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma is particularly per@@ ni@@ cious , because it is the mechan@@ ics of how we stay alive - the very act of brea@@ thing - that causes the cancer that k@@ ills .
Most Mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma cases are caused by exposure to as@@ best@@ os .
As@@ best@@ os is made up of tiny fi@@ b@@ res .
When the as@@ best@@ os is distur@@ bed and the fi@@ b@@ res are inhal@@ ed , they can become embedded in the ple@@ ura , the lining of the l@@ ungs .
As@@ best@@ os fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the ple@@ ura and can cause cell mut@@ ations .
&quot; The problem comes from inhal@@ ed need@@ le-@@ shaped fi@@ b@@ res of as@@ best@@ os , &quot; Professor Tom Treas@@ ure , a car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on who moved in 2001 to Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital .
The very hospital where Andrew Law@@ son suspec@@ ted he was exposed to as@@ best@@ os is now , ir@@ on@@ ically , a leading centre in treating mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma .
Treas@@ ure knew Law@@ son , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
Once the as@@ best@@ os need@@ les get into the lung tissue , says Treas@@ ure , &quot; the act of brea@@ thing pus@@ hes them on the peripher@@ y , which is where the lining is .
It is by its nature inv@@ a@@ sive from the very beginning .
The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma .
The effectiveness of surgery , for example , is hot@@ ly debated .
Some feel it is worth trying .
Treas@@ ure dis@@ agrees .
&quot; You can &apos;t exc@@ ise the ple@@ ura , &quot; he says .
You can &apos;t get your kni@@ fe round it .
Meanwhile the cancer &quot; is not very respon@@ sive to chem@@ o@@ therapy , &quot; which &quot; has an effect &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; Every now and again you get long survi@@ vors , &quot; says Treas@@ ure .
But in the end they all die .
Happ@@ ily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
The author Stephen J@@ ay G@@ ould died 20 years after diagnosis .
T@@ wo@@ -and-@@ a-@@ half years after his own diagnosis , Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t is still batt@@ ling on .
After cont@@ acting mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma Ab@@ bot@@ t was put in touch with Andrew Law@@ son , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-@@ man support and advice bure@@ au for fellow suff@@ er@@ ers .
&quot; H@@ ello , Canc@@ er Central , &quot; he would announce che@@ eri@@ ly when they called .
&quot; He was very positive , &quot; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
He had been diagno@@ sed 4 years before and was still very active .
Initi@@ ally , Ab@@ bot@@ t had been offered six cycles of chem@@ o@@ therapy that would take four months , and likely pro@@ long his life by just one month .
&quot; I felt desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
I felt like giving up .
Law@@ son , however , &quot; managed to put a slightly better t@@ int on things . &quot;
After seeing several consultants , Ab@@ bot@@ t decided to pursue his treatment with Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic Lan@@ g-@@ L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski , professor in thor@@ ac@@ ic surgery at Gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; We had an advantage in that I didn &apos;t have to be referred , I just rang them up and they saw me , &quot; Gra@@ ham ad@@ mits .
The average patient would have to get a refer@@ ral and have funding approved .
Money is crucial for those with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma to pursue the best available treatments .
But when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many suff@@ er@@ ers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation .
Andrew Law@@ son cont@@ acted Andrew Morgan , from Fiel@@ d Fis@@ her Water@@ house LL@@ P .
&quot; It has been known that as@@ best@@ os is no@@ xi@@ ous to health since 18@@ 98 , &quot; says Morgan .
But what changed in the 196@@ 0s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
That is where company negligence came in .
Andrew Law@@ son and Gu@@ y &apos;s hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a &quot; full-@@ value settlement &quot; since Law@@ son could not prove definiti@@ vely that his mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma was down to as@@ best@@ os exposure at Gu@@ y &apos;s .
After the in@@ quest into his death , a spo@@ kes@@ man for Gu@@ y &apos;s did confirm , however , that &quot; the as@@ best@@ os in the bas@@ ement area concerned was removed in the 1990s . &quot;
That was too late for Andrew Law@@ son .
How to remove as@@ best@@ os
In fact , p@@ inning le@@ th@@ al as@@ best@@ os exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers seeking compensation .
Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
In@@ surance records may have been lost .
And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the claim@@ ants certainly do not .
In response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be tra@@ ced .
The law has created a £ 3@@ 50@@ m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagno@@ sed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to su@@ e .
In these cases suff@@ er@@ ers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 120@@ ,000 .
About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like many involved with mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers , thinks that £ 3@@ 50@@ m represents &quot; a very good job &quot; for the insurance industry .
&quot; It &apos;s a deal written by insur@@ ers for insur@@ ers &quot; he says , sugge@@ sting that the sum is a quarter of what insur@@ ers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not interven@@ ed , and mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers were able to track down companies and su@@ e them in the normal way .
Even Mike P@@ enn@@ ing , then Works and Pen@@ sions minister , admitted that the law was &quot; not perfect . &quot;
But both P@@ enn@@ ing and Morgan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
&quot; People are suffering so much , and need help today , &quot; said P@@ enn@@ ing during the Mes@@ othe@@ li@@ oma Bill &apos;s second reading in December last year .
By then , Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic Lan@@ g-@@ L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
After their initial consultations , Lan@@ g-@@ L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski advised surgery which , in contrast to Tom Treas@@ ure , he believes has a positive effect .
This was followed by radio@@ therapy and chem@@ o@@ therapy - a tri@@ -@@ therapy for which Lan@@ g-@@ L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski can bo@@ ast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
Ab@@ bot@@ t felt em@@ powered .
&quot; That of course is one of the most important things , &quot; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
You see it in patients all the time .
There is some drive that keeps you going .
When you give up you can deterior@@ ate very quickly .
Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t went in for surgery in March 2012 .
By the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chem@@ o@@ therapy .
Fol@@ low-up sc@@ ans revealed no sign of the disease .
Then I had my scan in March &#91; 2014 &#93; .
There was multiple spot@@ ting &#91; of cancer &#93; around my ch@@ est .
I was just about to turn 50 .
It &apos;s not life threatening .
It &apos;s life ending .
Once again Ab@@ bot@@ t put himself through six cycles of chem@@ o@@ therapy .
Now there is no sign of the tum@@ ours .
But the process is both physi@@ cally and emo@@ tionally gru@@ elling .
You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I &apos;m gone for example , or showing my wife how the bo@@ iler tim@@ er works .
When you get bad news you start getting negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of El@@ lie , 16 , and Tam@@ sin , 14 , that is not always easy .
&quot; It &apos;s hard as a parent , &quot; he says .
It is difficult to know what to say and how much to say .
When I was first diagno@@ sed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn &apos;t going to become old .
They re@@ acted very differently .
Tam@@ sin is very soci@@ able and bo@@ ist@@ erous .
She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly .
El@@ lie was more reserved .
She didn &apos;t say much .
Such convers@@ ations are something that all cancer patients must face .

China ref@@ uses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders ; prote@@ sters vo@@ w ven@@ ge@@ ance
China &apos;s parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nom@@ inate candidates for the 20@@ 17 election , despite growing ag@@ itation for democratic reform .
The move is likely to spar@@ k long-@@ promised protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , as activists began planning and mobili@@ zing within hours of the announcement .
The decision by China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to we@@ ed out any candidates not lo@@ yal to Beijing .
&quot; It &apos;s not unexpected , but it is still in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating , &quot; said legislat@@ or E@@ mi@@ ly L@@ au , chair@@ woman of the Democratic Party .
This is not what Beijing promised .
They &apos;ve lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it &apos;s clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
Def@@ ending China &apos;s ruling , L@@ i F@@ ei , dep@@ uty secre@@ tary general of the Stand@@ ing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , said allowing public nom@@ inations in the election for Hong Kong &apos;s leader would be too &quot; cha@@ o@@ tic . &quot;
Since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing had promised to allow the region &apos;s residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 20@@ 17 .
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kon@@ gers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nom@@ in@@ ating committee tigh@@ tly controlled by Beijing .
And , according to a new clause , only candidates who &quot; love the country , and love Hong Kong &quot; would be allowed .
The ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-@@ profile protests in Hong Kong in years .
Beh@@ ind much of the pro-@@ democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occ@@ up@@ y Central With Love and Peace movement , whose organiz@@ ers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suff@@ rage .
On Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occ@@ up@@ y Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government &apos;s headquarters .
At the demonstration , organiz@@ ers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks .
However , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
In an online statement , organiz@@ ers said the movement &quot; has considered occup@@ ying Central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhau@@ sted and there is no other choice .
We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhau@@ sted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen .
Auth@@ orities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing &apos;s announcement for days , and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters , with police and barri@@ ca@@ des deployed .
Dri@@ ving the un@@ rest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
An influ@@ x of main@@ l@@ anders is fu@@ eling competition for products and services .
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing .
Some have critici@@ zed the Occ@@ up@@ y Central movement , saying its demonstrations put business - the li@@ f@@ eb@@ lood of Hong Kong - at risk .
&quot; The protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , &quot; said legislat@@ or Reg@@ ina I@@ p , who has long critici@@ zed the movement .
We don &apos;t want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
This is a perception that is bad for investment .
China &apos;s state-@@ run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong &apos;s democracy activists as agents of sub@@ version directed by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an un@@ official referendum on voting rights that drew 7@@ 80@@ ,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters .
And in July , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-@@ democracy demonstrations in the region &apos;s history .
US pro@@ m culture h@@ its university life with fresh@@ ers offered private jet entran@@ ces
We &apos;re exc@@ ited to be answer@@ ing this demand by launching the UK &apos;s first luxurious travel service for the students of today .
To make the maximum impact arriving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce Phan@@ tom , A@@ ston Martin or Mc@@ L@@ aren P@@ 1 .
Mr Ste@@ wart also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
The service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to hau@@ l their bel@@ ong@@ ings across the country in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
Pa@@ ired with our new VI@@ F options , we &apos;re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum f@@ uss and maximum luxury .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that &quot; students will be booking the service over the next few weeks . &quot;
The company also said that despite students facing tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
Stu@@ dents of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it &apos;s more important than ever to make a great first impression and VI@@ F is just the way to do that .
However , the National Union of Stu@@ dents criticised the service as out of touch .
Meg@@ an Dun@@ n , N@@ US vice president for higher education , said : &quot; This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spir@@ alling b@@ ills for basic essenti@@ als , before they can even start thinking about for@@ king out thousands of po@@ unds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence .
F@@ emin@@ ists take on race and police conduct post-@@ F@@ erg@@ us@@ on
The un@@ armed teen@@ ager was killed by a police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ o . , earlier this month .
At@@ ten@@ de@@ es hold their hands up while chan@@ ting , &quot; Hand@@ s up , don &apos;t shoot , &quot; as they wait in line before the fun@@ er@@ al .
After two weeks of protests in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo@@ . over the shooting of un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , blo@@ gger Mi@@ ri@@ am Zo@@ ila Per@@ ez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white femin@@ ists .
In her experience , white femin@@ ist comm@@ enters priori@@ tiz@@ ed gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality .
But as tensions rose in the Mid@@ west and drew nation@@ wide coverage , Per@@ ez saw responses from white women that c@@ entered 100 percent around race .
Comp@@ ared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9 , the personal es@@ says with titles like &quot; thoughts on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on as a white woman &quot; and &quot; F@@ emin@@ ism Is Not Just About Women &apos;s Op@@ pression &quot; came relatively late .
But to Per@@ ez , it demonstrated a significant shift .
&quot; In femin@@ ism , I don &apos;t think you get a lot of people talking about wh@@ it@@ eness and privilege in such a high level way , &quot; she said .
People felt called to voice something about what happened .
It &apos;s very em@@ ble@@ matic of the crisis we face and because &#91; the situation in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &#93; is so ra@@ ci@@ alized , they have to call that out .
For O@@ hi@@ o State University English professor K@@ ori@@ tha Mitch@@ ell , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren &apos;t seen as &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; in the cultural sphere .
&quot; I can post something fun@@ ny on Facebook about what &apos;s going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place , &quot; said Mitch@@ ell .
When I post something about how people of color are under sie@@ ge in their own country , the silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
&quot; How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? &quot; she asked .
For black women like Mitch@@ ell who have studied race , gender and sexu@@ ality in U.S. history , there is no dich@@ ot@@ om@@ y between issues regarding race and gender .
To her , black women have not had the luxury of ne@@ at@@ ly separ@@ ating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in main@@ stream femin@@ ist sp@@ heres , Angela H@@ at@@ tery , women and gender studies professor at George Mas@@ on University , says their predec@@ essors did the opposite .
&quot; Between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10,000 black men were ly@@ n@@ ched and the justification was almost always the rap@@ e of a white woman , &quot; said H@@ at@@ tery .
You needed the white woman to be complic@@ it in the nar@@ rative to justify the ly@@ n@@ ching .
To H@@ at@@ tery , the break@@ down between white and black women came when white suff@@ ra@@ gi@@ sts like Sus@@ an B. Anth@@ ony surve@@ yed the landscape in the late 18@@ 00@@ s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or bl@@ acks .
&quot; They made the decision to put their eggs in the bas@@ ket for votes for women and votes for Bl@@ acks would come later , &quot; said H@@ at@@ tery .
To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don &apos;t trust white women .
We haven &apos;t done a good job .
We haven &apos;t helped black women protect their hus@@ bands and sons ever .
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against ly@@ n@@ ching as the Association of Southern W@@ om@@ an for the Pre@@ vention of Lyn@@ ching .
The group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said Mitch@@ ell .
To Mitch@@ ell , the up@@ s@@ well of white femin@@ ist responses to the issues raised by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on - police conduct , ra@@ cial discrimination - reflect the times white femin@@ ists have had to play &quot; catch up &quot; to issues black women have gra@@ p@@ pled with for generations .
&quot; W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if the activists who have those &#91; traditional femin@@ ist &#93; platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? &quot; posed Mitch@@ ell .
Second wave femin@@ ists who made care@@ ers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now fig@@ uring out what that means .
Not@@ ed white femin@@ ist activ@@ ist Gl@@ oria St@@ einem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown &apos;s shooting to post a pointed column by Gu@@ ardi@@ an colum@@ n@@ ist Re@@ be@@ cca Car@@ roll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism .
&quot; I hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and ra@@ cial opinions that are meas@@ u@@ ra@@ bly different in public p@@ olls - will lead the change , &quot; St@@ einem wrote .
Although St@@ einem has vou@@ ched for a more inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in America still pu@@ zzle some .
American Enterprise Institute schol@@ ar Christ@@ ina Somm@@ ers , author of &quot; Who St@@ ole F@@ emin@@ ism ? , &quot; told She The People that young men in the United States , especially young men of color , are &quot; far more vulnerable than their si@@ sters , &quot; but St@@ einem &apos;s remarks on F@@ erg@@ us@@ on counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently initiated a small program , My Bro@@ ther &apos;s Ke@@ ep@@ er , to help vulnerable black and His@@ pan@@ ic young men , there was an an@@ gr@@ y reaction from many femin@@ ists , including Gl@@ oria St@@ einem .
Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the fore@@ front of main@@ stream femin@@ ism .
After U.S. border pat@@ rol ap@@ prehen@@ ded nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied minors at the country &apos;s sou@@ thwest border this year , immigration reform sur@@ faced once again - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
Andrea Merc@@ ado , co-@@ chair of We Bel@@ ong Together , an organization mobili@@ zing women for immigration reform , said that in order to re@@ brand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share imm@@ igrant women &apos;s stories .
&quot; They speak for themselves , &quot; Merc@@ ado said .
When the vast majority of employment visas are given to &#91; male immigrants &#93; , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; These stories re@@ son@@ ate with women &apos;s organizations , &quot; she said .
I@@ p@@ swi@@ ch &apos; pi@@ g in residence &apos; house for sale
A picture for a house for sale in Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large pi@@ g at rest in the living room .
On sale for £ 120@@ ,000 , the deta@@ ched one-@@ bedroom property si@@ ts on a private road in I@@ p@@ swi@@ ch .
The partic@@ ul@@ ars featured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pi@@ g with its head re@@ sting on a set@@ tee .
Estate agents Con@@ n@@ ells said the pi@@ g in the photo was the home owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; However , the photo was put up in error and has since been removed , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ woman for the company said .
In the partic@@ ul@@ ars for the property , Con@@ n@@ ells described the former meeting house as a &quot; unique one bedroom deta@@ ched house . &quot;
Although the agency has removed the image from its website , it still appears in publi@@ city material .
The house sale has spark@@ ed interest on social media , where some have en@@ qui@@ red whether the pi@@ g is included in the sale .
S@@ W town of Harv@@ ey has fresh milli@@ on@@ aire after Lot@@ to win
A Harv@@ ey lot@@ to player is in the month .
The search is on for a new milli@@ on@@ aire in Per@@ th &apos;s south-@@ west , with one lucky person taking home nearly $ 1.1 million from Saturday night &apos;s lot@@ to draw .
A Harv@@ ey new@@ sa@@ gency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years , the last being $ 1 million in November 2009 .
However the lucky winner has yet to come forward .
O@@ wn@@ er of the store Steve For@@ ward said the win was creating a bu@@ z@@ z around the small town in Per@@ th &apos;s south west .
It &apos;s the talk of the town and everyone is pretty exc@@ ited .
We thought a win like this might be close .
Ei@@ ght W@@ A winners have celebrated division one wins last month , c@@ app@@ ing off a lucky few weeks for the state &apos;s players .
Last week a Cann@@ ing V@@ ale player became one of five August milli@@ on@@ aire &apos;s , following a Bel@@ mont couple &apos;s massive $ 7.@@ 5 million win only a few weeks prior .
The winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gi@@ fted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house .
The Harv@@ ey milli@@ on@@ aire brings W@@ A up to 59 division one winners for the year , tot@@ alling in nearly $ 85 million .
Le@@ oni@@ das beg@@ ged in the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial arena
It was not only the gla@@ di@@ ators that stood ank@@ le deep in the mu@@ d at the park during Rhein@@ bach &apos;s first Roman day .
The appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who bra@@ ved the rain and autumn chill , and who were completely taken in by the historical show .
There was a color@@ ful start with represent@@ ations , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information on Roman times and their significance to the R@@ hin@@ eland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ tial arts group from the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; Am@@ or Mor@@ tis &quot; , which , every time it stopped ra@@ ining , sei@@ zed the opportunity to demonstrate their robust mar@@ tial arts in the soft sand covered arena .
The owner of gla@@ di@@ ators &quot; Le@@ oni@@ das &quot; proved himself to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and expert present@@ er , who sent men , one after one , into the ring for a hero@@ ic du@@ el in a variety of gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial gen@@ res .
At first the &quot; pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs &quot; were lined up with a rec@@ tan@@ g@@ ular shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , as well a cu@@ isse on the left leg , and a v@@ emb@@ race on the right arm .
Then there were the &quot; E@@ sse@@ dar@@ i@@ i &quot; wearing a bre@@ ast-@@ plate , and carrying a short s@@ word and a spe@@ ar , as well as an iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , a cu@@ isse and an arm guard .
What was particular impressive was the performance of the &quot; Re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , who went up against the &quot; Sec@@ utor &quot; with a cast@@ -@@ net , tri@@ dent and da@@ gger , and who , after a short fight , kno@@ cked the guys to the ground .
The s@@ words clas@@ hed against one another , the shi@@ el@@ ds c@@ lan@@ ked and the sp@@ ears fle@@ w , zo@@ oming through the arena , so much so that you fe@@ ared for the safety of the gla@@ di@@ ators .
However , the gigan@@ tic &quot; Sum@@ ma Ru@@ dis &quot; , a mus@@ cular refer@@ ee , constantly kept a keen eye on them .
&quot; We wanted to revi@@ ve the Roman everyday life , and enable the culture of Roman times to be experienced &quot; , Lor@@ enz E@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , the chairman of the events organization &quot; Fre@@ undes@@ kreis Rö@@ mer@@ kanal &quot; explained as the intention behind the spectac@@ le .
Cl@@ aus W@@ eh@@ age , the dep@@ uty may@@ or , announced in his welcome speech that after two years of preparation , the park was transformed for one day into an &quot; O@@ pp@@ i@@ dum Roman@@ um &quot; , a Roman city .
In the end , the Rom@@ ans not only brought war and con@@ quest to our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings , which we can still admire today .
Some of these remains could also be mar@@ vel@@ ed at during the Roman day , such as &quot; A@@ du@@ ä@@ du@@ kt@@ -@@ Mar@@ m@@ or &quot; from the ele@@ ven@@ -@@ meter high , and 14@@ 00 meter long , Roman can@@ al bridge , which is the only one in Lü@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
The Fron@@ tin@@ us organization compared , both then and now , the water and energy supply , and the managing director , Pet@@ ra Fri@@ cke , said : &quot; We still deri@@ ve benefit today from the knowledge of back then &quot; .
This was confirmed by the surve@@ y@@ or R@@ al@@ ph Hei@@ liger from &quot; Ingenie@@ ur@@ te@@ am@@ Zwei &quot; in Rhein@@ back , who introduced the instruments used by the Rom@@ ans for surve@@ ying , such as the Chor@@ ob@@ at , Gro@@ ma and Di@@ op@@ tra .
The Rö@@ mer@@ villa in Blan@@ ken@@ heim presented sk@@ et@@ ches and models of the excav@@ ations of 18@@ 94 , as well as bri@@ cks made from the original hypo@@ cau@@ st , for@@ c@@ ed-@@ air heating , which was once used to warm up Rö@@ mer@@ villa .
The foot@@ prints of a wol@@ f and fox from two thousand years ago were also impressive , and were left behind after they tro@@ d in cla@@ y before it was bur@@ nt .
In 2011 the office of archaeological monument conservation at the state association in Rhein@@ land excav@@ ated the remains of a Roman Villa in an industrial estate in north Rhein@@ bach .
The en@@ closing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a kil@@ n for dr@@ ying crops and mal@@ ting .
The building probably belon@@ ged to a Villa Rus@@ tica , an agricultural man@@ or , archae@@ ologist Dr. J@@ enni@@ fer Mor@@ schei@@ ser explained .
A range of finds from the excav@@ ation were presented in a glass cab@@ inet , among which were a large plate , several fine glass j@@ ars and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
Mor@@ schei@@ ser pre@@ sum@@ ed that the Villa was there from between the first and fourth century An@@ no Dom@@ ini until the invasion of the German@@ ic people in the former Roman Rhein@@ land .
The children also kept themselves busy playing the Roman wind@@ m@@ ills game , similar to today &apos;s mill game , or they wrote , as did the Roman pupils at the time , their names with metal p@@ ens on wa@@ x tab@@ lets .
At the Roman thermal bath stand from Z@@ ül@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves ; at the Rhein@@ bach glass museum stand they made glass mo@@ sa@@ ics ; and at the Ei@@ fel Net@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ m nature center stand , they got to use a heavy whe@@ at mill made of stone so they could gr@@ ind the fl@@ our needed for a p@@ ita bread or mu@@ es@@ li .
The visitors ro@@ de through the park in a Roman carri@@ age , which had been re@@ constructed to be true to the original , and pul@@ led along by two cold blood horses , and also passed by the impressive city gym stand , where the results of their &quot; Roman project week &quot; were revealed .
From 13 to 21 September , the community of Wach@@ t@@ berg will also participate in a Roman week , in what is being called Roman Year 2014 throughout the R@@ hin@@ eland . The event will remember the death of Kaiser August@@ us 2000 years ago .
Together with the clubs dedicated to local , regional and historical traditions and characteristics , as well as the Wach@@ t@@ berg hiking club , the partnership association , and the Ober@@ b@@ ach@@ em am@@ ateur dramati@@ cs club , hiking , rec@@ it@@ als , cooking evening and guidance for school classes , among other things , will be offered , and the Roman history of Wach@@ t@@ berg shall be remembered .
The Roman legi@@ onn@@ aire will , for example , talk about his dra@@ f@@ ty work in Wach@@ t@@ berg ; plants will be presented as living monuments of Roman times , and a hum@@ or@@ ous lesson on the matter of international understanding between a &quot; German@@ ic &quot; group from Wach@@ t@@ berg and Roman inv@@ aders will be show@@ c@@ ased .
A@@ den@@ dorf elem@@ entary school has devoted itself to a week@@ -@@ long , Rom@@ an-@@ them@@ ed project .
The Roman week should , once again , enable us to experience the numerous and common , yet , at first gl@@ ance , no longer visible , traces of the Rom@@ ans in Wach@@ t@@ berg .
Wach@@ t@@ berg town hall will give a small presentation on the sanc@@ tu@@ ary in Ber@@ k@@ um , which was found in 18@@ 79 .
E@@ b@@ ola : The epide@@ mic is putting stra@@ in on West Africa &apos;s economy
The E@@ b@@ ola epide@@ mic in West Africa is also a huge hit for the economy .
Mark@@ ets have been abandoned , and international companies are keeping their distance .
The devastating E@@ b@@ ola epide@@ mic has dealt the economy in West Africa a heavy blow .
C@@ rop@@ s are rot@@ ting in the fields , mines have been deser@@ ted , and the markets have been abandoned . The virus has cost the region de@@ arly .
Even some international companies are keeping their distance .
&quot; The E@@ b@@ ola epide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one &quot; , the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , concluded .
Liber@@ ia is the most affected country
&quot; It is a total catastrop@@ he ; we are losing a lot of money &quot; , Al@@ ha@@ ji B@@ am@@ o@@ go said , who s@@ ells clothes in the second largest market in Liber@@ ia &apos;s capital city , Mon@@ ro@@ via .
The only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or dis@@ infec@@ tant against E@@ b@@ ola .
Liber@@ ia is the country most affected by the virus ; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fe@@ ver .
The health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all cor@@ ners of the country .
The virus has even spread to Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
In total , more than 1500 people have already died , and thousands more have been infected .
Foreign businesses are pul@@ ling their employees out
All over countries rich with resources , companies are suspen@@ ding operations .
Foreign companies such as the steel group Ar@@ cel@@ or Mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions .
Even local traders and farmers are re@@ acting : Only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to re@@ plen@@ ish their supplies .
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liber@@ ia , where they have been put under quar@@ ant@@ ine , c@@ ac@@ ao and coffee be@@ ans , to name a few , and which are important for export , are rot@@ ting in the fields .
The farmers do not dare leave their homes for the crops .
Food suppliers are scar@@ ce
&quot; People are traveling less and less &quot; , Phil@@ li@@ pe De V@@ re@@ yer , a Par@@ isi@@ an expert on the economy of West Africa said .
For example , a man , who normally goes to the market and s@@ ells his vegetables , is choosing to stay at home .
The population is , therefore , facing the consequences of the epide@@ mic head on and feeling the pressure : Food suppliers are scar@@ ce .
The supply of stap@@ le foods such as rice is d@@ wind@@ ling in the markets .
At the same time , the image of the region , which is heavily reli@@ ant on international companies , is under threat , and this has far-reaching consequences .
The biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time , Phil@@ li@@ ppe Hu@@ gon , from the French Th@@ ink T@@ ank , Ir@@ is , said .
What is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread .
Invest@@ ors may get the impression &quot; that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liber@@ ia , and , therefore , also to invest &quot; , Hu@@ gon warned .
The disease is also bur@@ dening the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the States
The disease is also bur@@ dening the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the affected States .
The rating agency Moo@@ dy &apos;s fears that their budgets are being heavily stra@@ ined by the high expenditure on the health system , and also by the dec@@ lining economy .
The African Development Bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tune of 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) to the health systems of affected countries .
The effects in Nigeria , where up to now only a few E@@ b@@ ola cases have been diagno@@ sed , are already notic@@ eable .
Yet the o@@ il-@@ rich region in the south of the N@@ iger Delta is not yet affected .
However , elsewhere , many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming infected .
There is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations .
Sho@@ o@@ ters are celeb@@ rating their 50@@ th anniversary
The gun club &quot; T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald &quot; in Bern@@ gau is celeb@@ rating its 50@@ th anniversary from 12th to 14th September .
The preparations for the party are well under@@ way in T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald gun club , which will celebrate 50 years since being established on 12th to 14th September .
The plan for Friday 12th September is an evening of entertainment provided by the group &quot; Dor@@ fro@@ cker &quot; .
The large cann@@ on will be fi@@ red on Saturday at 18 : 00 .
Fol@@ lowed by a pleasant evening with &quot; Sto@@ ap@@ fäl@@ zer Spit@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; ( Sto@@ ap@@ fäl@@ zer ra@@ sc@@ als ) in a large party tent .
A bra@@ ss band will be catering for the music
The highlights on Sunday will be the festival service , which will take place at 9 : 30@@ am in the parish church , and also the proc@@ essions at 2@@ pm .
There will also be a ranking announcement in the afternoon for the national and county shooting competition .
A particularly attractive sight will be the 25 festival women in their Dir@@ n@@ d@@ ls .
The festival band will be Bern@@ gau bra@@ ss band .
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and state secre@@ tary Albert Fü@@ ra@@ cker have taken on the spon@@ sor@@ ship .
The original name , &quot; Sch@@ ütz@@ en@@ gesellschaft T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ gau &quot; ( gun society T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ gau ) dates back to 19@@ 07 , when , on 21st March , the club was founded and described as &quot; social entertainment by means of pist@@ ol and small-@@ cali@@ ber target practice &quot; .
In 19@@ 37 the Nazi regime closed the club down .
Then on 30@@ th April 1964 , 19 young men founded the club again , and launched the &quot; new &quot; gun club &quot; T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald &quot; in Bern@@ gau at Lu@@ kas guest@@ -@@ house .
Karl März and Ad@@ olf Ri@@ ed led the club as range officers during its tough early years . The main objective then was to find a club pu@@ b and set up a shooting company .
As early as autumn 1965 the shooting club started out in &quot; L@@ ein@@ inger &quot; guest house with two teams competing against one another .
The following year , target shooting was set up as a sport , organized into seven teams , ranging in ability , all the way up to the local premi@@ er le@@ ague .
The club records roll out every year , and the magic 3@@ 80 rounds were set up for the first time in 1980 by Ru@@ di Mei@@ er .
Just as the achievements of the active members has increased , so have the number of members .
Once the club pu@@ b &quot; L@@ ein@@ inger &quot; no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club , the club &apos;s management at the time , lead by Johann Rin@@ n , decided to set up its future home in the bas@@ ement room of the new &quot; Land@@ gas@@ thof H@@ är@@ tei@@ s &quot; ( a country hotel ) .
After 27@@ 00 hours of hard work , Father Stras@@ ser issued the bl@@ essing of the church for the new g@@ uns room on 8th May 1988 .
One of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 4@@ 4th local shooting competition , which is linked to the formal consec@@ ration of the new shooting flag in July 1991 .
On 23@@ rd and 24@@ th April 1994 , the shooting club celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
In 1995 the cann@@ on group was founded .
Josef Sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was the head of the cann@@ on division .
Organ@@ izing the Bavarian Cann@@ on Meeting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the &quot; cann@@ on sh@@ oo@@ ters &quot; , and for the club as a whole .
Many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to moderni@@ ze the rooms and shooting facilities in the Bern@@ gau courtyard , making it state of the art .
Ele@@ ven teams go head to head
The sporting achievements of the shooting club are also impressive .
Currently there are a total of ele@@ ven teams that are taking part in the competitions : six air ri@@ f@@ les teams , one pel@@ let gun team , one K@@ K@@ 1 sport target pist@@ ol team , one youth team and two ol@@ d-@@ tim@@ er teams .
The first team comp@@ ris@@ ed of L@@ ars E@@ ll@@ rich , Kath@@ ar@@ ina E@@ ll@@ rich , Ste@@ ff@@ i Grad and Ker@@ sti@@ n K@@ ell@@ er@@ mann was promoted to number 1 in the regional le@@ ague in 2013 / 14 , up from the local premi@@ er le@@ ague ( the highest of the shooting le@@ ag@@ ues in the AN@@ B ) .
The second team comp@@ ris@@ ed of Ver@@ ena Moo@@ s@@ burger , Alexand@@ ra Mei@@ er , E@@ va Schuh@@ mann and Tob@@ ias Gra@@ ml was promoted from the North local le@@ ague to the local premi@@ er le@@ ague .
In addition to shooting , events such as Bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ chen , Fa@@ sch@@ ing and König@@ s@@ ball , club excursions and also Christmas celebrations are all club traditions .
The sh@@ oo@@ ters also attend the parish and community festivals .
Tony Ste@@ wart cra@@ shes in return to track
Tony Ste@@ wart &apos;s return to the track has ended only a little over hal@@ f@@ way through his race at Atlan@@ ta Motor Spe@@ ed@@ way .
Ste@@ wart hit the wall for the second time after his right front ti@@ re ble@@ w out on la@@ p 17@@ 2 , ending his night .
Ste@@ wart dro@@ ve his bat@@ tered car to the garage and then ex@@ ited without speaking to re@@ por@@ ters .
His crew chief C@@ had John@@ ston said the 14 team was disappointed , but will now start focusing on next weekend &apos;s race in Rich@@ mond , Vir@@ g@@ inia .
&quot; I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him , &quot; John@@ ston said .
We &apos;ll go on to Rich@@ mond and hope we can do better there .
Ste@@ wart first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night &apos;s race following a col@@ li@@ sion with Ky@@ le Bus@@ ch , requiring work to the right side of his car .
&quot; I went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well , &quot; John@@ ston said , adding , &quot; It just didn &apos;t work out . &quot;
Not long after the second crash , Ste@@ wart &apos;s car was loaded onto the hau@@ ler and the team was packed up and ready to leave .
Ste@@ wart ski@@ pped three N@@ AS@@ CA@@ R Sp@@ rin@@ t Cup races after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dir@@ t-@@ track race in up@@ state New York .
He decided to return this week , nee@@ ding to win either at Atlan@@ ta or the next race at Rich@@ mond to claim a spot in the Ch@@ ase .
He returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-@@ year-old Kev@@ in W@@ ard J@@ r . , who had step@@ ped on the track to confront Ste@@ wart during a race .
Auth@@ orities said Friday that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks .
No decision has been made about whether Ste@@ wart will face charges .
The three-@@ time champion received a big che@@ er when he was introduced before the race .
Starting in the 12th spot , Ste@@ wart ran in the top 10 early in the race , getting as high as fourth .
Then , on la@@ p 12@@ 2 after a re@@ start , Bus@@ ch &apos;s No .
18 machine got loose coming out of turn 2 and ban@@ ged into Ste@@ wart , sending both cars against the wall .
Ste@@ wart carried on but dropped back to 21st .

Ukrainian army has abandoned Lu@@ han@@ sk airport
Pro-@@ Russian figh@@ ters are gaining ground again in East Ukraine .
Following heavy fighting in which Russian tank divisions are also said to have participated , the Ukrainian army has today , Monday , abandoned Lu@@ han@@ sk airport , the re@@ bel stron@@ gh@@ old .
The army announced at the same time that over the past 24 hours , seven soldiers have been killed .
The Ukrainian President , Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ schen@@ ko , had previously taken appropriate action personally due to the heavy defe@@ ats suffered by his army in the fight against the separ@@ ati@@ sts , and announced changes to the senior leadership of the army without going into detail .
Pro-@@ Russian separ@@ ati@@ sts shot down an aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops , pro-@@ Russian separ@@ ati@@ sts say that they have once again shot down a war@@ plane and two military helicop@@ ters .
Re@@ bel forces announced on Monday that around 100 soldiers are also believed to have been injured or killed in fighting in the Don@@ e@@ z@@ k region ; according to Russian agencies .
Co@@ ast@@ guard ships sun@@ k
The reb@@ els also claimed that for the first time they have sun@@ k two of the Ukrainian coast@@ guard &apos;s boats in the Sea of A@@ zo@@ v .
The Ukrainian border police confirmed that two of its ships came under fire on Sunday near to the har@@ bor town of Mari@@ u@@ pol .
During the attack seven border guards were injured , according to a spo@@ kes@@ person speaking to the station 1@@ 12.@@ ua in Kie@@ v .

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break their agreements with Russian as a result of their planned deployment to East Europe in response to the Ukrainian crisis .
In Brussels on Monday , the Secretary General of NATO , Anders Fo@@ gh Ras@@ mus@@ sen , said that NATO will adhere to the NATO-@@ Russia Council formation agreement of 1997 .
Nevertheless , the head of NATO accused Russia of &quot; a fla@@ grant breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; Today we must face up to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner &quot; , Ras@@ mus@@ sen said .
Docum@@ ents and statements from the Russian side reveal &quot; that they consider us as enemies &quot; .
Str@@ eng@@ th@@ ened NATO presence
Ras@@ mus@@ sen also announced that he wants to strengthen the presence of NATO in East Europe .
A NATO summit meeting in Wales to decide on a &quot; Re@@ ad@@ iness Action Plan &quot; will ensure that &quot; we will have a more visible NATO presence in the East , if needs be &quot; , Ras@@ mus@@ sen explained in Brussels on Monday .
Kie@@ v and Moscow have agreed to new talks on gas
According to official data , Russia and Ukraine have agreed to new talks to settle disputes over gas .
The negotiations have been scheduled to take place next Saturday , the Russian Minister of Energy , Alexander No@@ wa@@ k , said on Monday .
The decision of the European Union as to whether they will also send a representative to the talks is yet to be made .
Due to the disputes over gas prices , Ukraine has not been receiving fuel from Russia for weeks .
The EU Energy Commissioner , G@@ ün@@ ther O@@ ett@@ inger has recently arbit@@ rated between the two sides .
Ukraine warned that Russia could also suspend the gas supply to Europe .
Europe purchases around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources , a large proportion of which flows through Ukraine .
Merkel puts her foot down : &quot; Let &apos;s be clear &quot; , t@@ olls will come
Once again the Chancellor makes herself clear .
However , there is still no charter expla@@ ining all the complex details .
Sti@@ ff opposition from the CD@@ U against the t@@ olls is making the CS@@ U increasingly an@@ gri@@ er .
Following persistent opposition from the CD@@ U , the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of t@@ olls .
&quot; Let &apos;s be crystal clear : They are mentioned in the coalition agreement , and we will have them &quot; , the party leader said on Monday following a CD@@ U party conference with top committees in Berlin .
But Merkel has not , for the time being , established a detailed model .
&quot; Cer@@ tain parameters &quot; were mentioned in the black@@ -@@ red government program .
The Minister of Transport , Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) &quot; made a suggestion , and we are continuing to work on it &quot; .
The N@@ W-@@ CD@@ U , however , is insi@@ sting that t@@ olls on all streets be objec@@ ted against .
Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance , Wolfgang Schä@@ ub@@ le ( CD@@ U ) , is participating construc@@ tively in the consultations on the draft bill .
He has spoken with D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt on the topic and about further possibilities for capitali@@ zing more and investing more in infrastructure , such as developing broadband .
&quot; There is nothing special about it &quot; . On Sunday , Schä@@ ub@@ le let an article in the Spiegel pass without comment , which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compens@@ ating motorway investors with returns on the t@@ olls - after the 20@@ 17 election .
As a result , the leader of the CS@@ U , Hor@@ st Seeh@@ o@@ fer , warned about developing toll concepts in the cab@@ inet against the Minister in charge .
The dep@@ uty leader of the CD@@ U , Ar@@ min La@@ sch@@ et , reinforced his objections .
&quot; The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and A-@@ roads would get t@@ olls &quot; , the state chairman for North R@@ hin@@ e-@@ West@@ p@@ ha@@ lia said .
The fact that Seeh@@ o@@ fer has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign .
Opposition to the plans has also been received from the CD@@ U state association in Baden-@@ Wür@@ ttem@@ berg and R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
This is due to concerns that a toll would have a negative impact on small-@@ scale border traffic to neighbor@@ ing states .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer has demanded loyalty to the coalition following criticism of the t@@ olls from members of the CD@@ U .
Die Linke ( the L@@ ef@@ ties ) are considering the plans a failure given the argu@@ ing within the union .
&quot; The mess@@ ed up toll is dead &quot; , Ber@@ nd Ri@@ ex@@ inger , the party leader , told the &quot; Neuen O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; ( newspaper ) on Monday .
&quot; If the toll fails , the Minister fails &quot; . D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt wants to introduce an obligation to have toll labels on all German streets as of 20@@ 16 .
According to the coalition agreement , car owners in German must not , however , have to face additional charges .
As such , road tax should be offset against t@@ olls for them .
According to EU law , however , the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality .
Gene@@ tic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed
A British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a mis@@ diagnosis .
Kar@@ in Ro@@ d@@ gers spent most of her teen@@ age life belie@@ ving that she only had years to live after she was diagno@@ sed with another disease .
She actually had Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mar@@ ie-@@ T@@ oo@@ th disease ( CM@@ T ) - a group of inher@@ ited dis@@ orders that damage ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ ine .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK said that mis@@ diagnosis is a common problem among people with CM@@ T because so little is known about the condition .
About 23@@ ,000 people in the UK are thought to have CM@@ T , which can cause motor symptoms such as mus@@ cle weakness , an aw@@ k@@ ward ga@@ it and cur@@ led to@@ es .
Su@@ ffer@@ ers can also experience num@@ b@@ ness or pain and the condition is inc@@ u@@ rable and progressive , meaning symptoms get worse over time .
When Ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Frie@@ dre@@ ich &apos;s at@@ ax@@ ia ( F@@ A ) - a condition which had a very poor progno@@ sis .
Ro@@ d@@ gers thought that she was going to be whe@@ el@@ chair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30@@ s .
The mo@@ ther@@ -@@ of-@@ two , who is now 51 , said : &quot; As a child I knew I couldn &apos;t do the same things as others .
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
I could never roll@@ er-@@ sk@@ ate or sk@@ at@@ ebo@@ ard with other kids and got bul@@ lied at school a lot because of the way I wal@@ ked and ran .
Ro@@ d@@ gers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her A@@ chil@@ les ten@@ d@@ ons and strai@@ gh@@ ten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consul@@ tant left the room which said that she suffered from F@@ A .
&quot; I felt guilty because I &apos;d been no@@ sy and so I didn &apos;t tell anybody , but I did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the F@@ A Association , &quot; she said .
When I got the information back I was g@@ ob@@ sm@@ ack@@ ed and in the worst state of pan@@ ic possible .
I thought I &apos;d be in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own fun@@ er@@ al .
She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t deterior@@ ated as much as she thought they would have and asked her sur@@ ge@@ on about it .
He just stood up and hu@@ gged me and said &apos; my dear I don &apos;t think you have it , as you would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair now . &apos; 
I think you have something a lot less life threatening .
After some genetic testing she was found to have CM@@ T .
&quot; When he explained what CM@@ T was , I thought I &apos;d drawn the lucky stra@@ w , &quot; she said .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK has launched CM@@ T awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
Re@@ tired Ser@@ ge@@ ant Major Ber@@ ni B@@ ie@@ ther has been working as an arti@@ fic@@ er ever since the closure of the former military training ground
Not a shot has been fi@@ red in the former military training ground in Mün@@ s@@ ingen for almost ten years .
Nevertheless , dead@@ ly amm@@ uni@@ tion turns up in the center of the bio@@ sphere region of Sw@@ ab@@ ian J@@ ura every month .
The sh@@ ells are sometimes so dangerous still that they have to be de@@ ton@@ ated there .
A de@@ af@@ ening b@@ ang echo@@ es across the center of the bio@@ sphere region upon de@@ ton@@ ation .
The last live round to be fi@@ red at the military training ground in Mün@@ s@@ ingen was in December 2004 , which , at the end of 2005 , after 110 years of military operation , was closed down .
Since then , the 6@@ 500 hectares of land has been the center of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian J@@ ura &apos;s bio@@ sphere region , which opened up 13 designated path@@ ways for hi@@ kers and cy@@ cli@@ sts .
Wash@@ ing@@ t@@ on-@@ area business owners &quot; tax burden moun@@ ts as economy re@@ bo@@ unds
A re@@ bound@@ ing economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax b@@ ills for companies across the country grew mo@@ dest@@ ly last year as the economic recovery acceler@@ ated , according to new research released last week , and Wash@@ ing@@ t@@ on-@@ area firms were no exception .
District , Mar@@ y@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ inia businesses collec@@ tively paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to state and local co@@ ff@@ ers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion collected in 2012 .
Busin@@ esses &quot; state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.@@ 3 percent , to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared with 3.@@ 9 percent the year before , and it was the third consec@@ utive year of growth after back@@ -@@ to-@@ back years of shr@@ in@@ king b@@ ills in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose at a faster cli@@ p , 4.@@ 3 percent , than local le@@ vies , 3.@@ 9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young and the Center on State Ta@@ x@@ ation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the District &apos;s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s revenue comes from firms .
Vir@@ g@@ inia , at 28 percent , generates the least amount of tax revenue , proportion@@ ately , from business .
Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a re@@ bound in companies &quot; real estate values , researchers say , which pushed property taxes up 3.@@ 7 percent this year after three consec@@ utive years of sub-@@ 1 percent growth .
While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California , New York and Texas , it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well .
Companies in the District , Mar@@ y@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ inia collec@@ tively for@@ ked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - year-@@ over-@@ year growth of 4.@@ 2 percent .
But the apparent bo@@ un@@ c@@ eb@@ ack in property values isn &apos;t doing nearly as much to infl@@ ate state and local tax revenues in Mar@@ y@@ land , where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies &quot; tax b@@ ills .
Vir@@ g@@ inia and D.@@ C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax b@@ ills in the form of property taxes .
&quot; What &apos;s happening in Mar@@ y@@ land is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the D.@@ C. area , is owned either by the government or by non@@ profits , which don &apos;t pay property taxes , &quot; said Dou@@ glas Lin@@ d@@ hol@@ m , executive director of the Center on State Ta@@ x@@ ation .
So Mar@@ y@@ land is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
The recent re@@ bound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recover@@ ing real estate market .
Business incomes also appear to be on the mend , according to the data .
Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.@@ 3 billion , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Mar@@ y@@ land collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
While tr@@ ending in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses isn &apos;t growing at the same pace in all three places .
The District &apos;s rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.@@ 3 percent , while Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s growth was substantially faster at 4.@@ 9 percent .
Only Vir@@ g@@ inia posted a bel@@ o@@ w-@@ average tax bill b@@ ump of 4.@@ 1 percent .
Vir@@ g@@ inia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three juris@@ dic@@ tions ( all of which have flat corporate rates ) at 6 percent .
Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s corporate rate is 8.@@ 25 percent , while the District &apos;s stands at a relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Vir@@ g@@ inia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Mar@@ y@@ land .
The District wasn &apos;t evaluated in the study .
Despite its advantage , Vir@@ g@@ inia is facing competitive pressure from its neighb@@ or to the south .
North Carol@@ ina recently signed legislation lower@@ ing its corporate rate this year from 6.@@ 9 percent to 6 percent , in line with Vir@@ g@@ inia , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state &apos;s business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 20@@ 17 .
Meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington region seem to be far@@ ing better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass@@ -@@ through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District , Mar@@ y@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ inia sur@@ ged 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
Res@@ ear@@ chers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nation@@ wide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.@@ 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
However , the Washington area may lag behind as the slow@@ down in federal spending takes its toll on the region &apos;s labor market .
Twin town : German beer for Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou
H@@ ops and m@@ alt - a popular combination even in China .
German beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt &apos;s twin town in China would like a bre@@ wer@@ y , and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
German beer bre@@ wed in Frankfurt &apos;s twin town of Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials .
&quot; We would be delighted if a German bre@@ wer@@ y would set up business in our city &quot; , the dep@@ uty party secre@@ tary of the southern Chinese city , L@@ i Y@@ i@@ wei , said this week during a visit to the city by an SP@@ D deleg@@ ate .
Time and time again throughout the conversation , the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metro@@ polis .
Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou , which is also known as C@@ anton in Germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in China L@@ i adverti@@ sed .
So , the people also have the buying power to afford German beer .
The H@@ es@@ sian SP@@ D chairman Th@@ or@@ sten Schä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel , who led the German delegation , said to the host that he would keeps his ears open in Germany for a possible partner .
&quot; You don &apos;t need a lot to make beer : good water , grain and a z@@ est for life &quot; , he added over lunch with the senior party member in Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou .
This z@@ est for like already be@@ ams out of Mr L@@ i , he said flat@@ tering the host .
After that , the official from Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou cli@@ cked gl@@ asses with Schä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel - albeit with red wine , which was served with dinner .
The Chinese brand T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o has traces leading back to the German art of bre@@ wing .
T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is bre@@ wed according to the German p@@ urity law .
More business operations
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou , the dep@@ uty party leader , L@@ i , said .
Lufthansa used to offer such a flight , but can@@ cel@@ ed it for economic reasons in 2012 .
&quot; It would be worth it again &quot; , the local politi@@ cian seemed convinced .
&quot; The business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow &quot; .
At present , travelers would have to take a de@@ tour via Ch@@ ang@@ sh@@ a in the province of Hun@@ an , L@@ i compla@@ ined .
The administration of the province of Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong , whose capital city is Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou , is also hoping for a flight connection .
The dep@@ uty govern@@ or of the province , Ch@@ en Y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , emphasi@@ zed this wish during his talks with the social democra@@ t .
&quot; That is a very good idea &quot; , Schä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel answered - the Chinese dep@@ uty minister , L@@ i J@@ inj@@ un , an intimate expert on Germany , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
Well@@ -@@ cultiv@@ ated partnership
The aff@@ able dep@@ uty party leader of Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
L@@ i Y@@ i@@ wei has already been to the Main , but not in the capacity of his role .
He only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption alleg@@ ations .
Even the party leader of the region , W@@ an Q@@ ing@@ lian , had to leave .
The action taken against the officials from Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou is part of the nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration , which was rigor@@ ously implemented by the head of state , X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping .

Environ@@ ment@@ ally friendly vacuum clean@@ ers and increasing wages
Stri@@ ct environmental standards for the future shall apply to all cars and vacuum clean@@ ers that go on sale as of today .
As of September 1st , new vacuum clean@@ ers will come with a label , similar to that on refriger@@ ators and washing machines , which will allow buyers to see key information at a gl@@ ance , such as the energy efficiency of the app@@ liance .
New cars that fall under the emissions class &quot; Euro 6 &quot; will receive a higher nit@@ ric o@@ xide value .

Ama@@ zon bu@@ ys Twi@@ tch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion
AM@@ A@@ Z@@ ON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning : The online re@@ ta@@ iler - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twi@@ tch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion ( $ US@@ 9@@ 70 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected Twi@@ tch to be bought , but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer .
Three months ago the sale of Twi@@ tch to Google &apos;s video service , for a cool billion , looked all wra@@ pped up , and the pa@@ iring seemed natural .
Twi@@ tch , founded only three years ago as Ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for gam@@ ers to broadcast their in-@@ game fe@@ ats ; a &quot; YouTube for live gaming , &quot; in Business In@@ si@@ der &apos;s words .
Twi@@ tch &apos;s interface .
And &quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; a gen@@ re of videos in which wis@@ e@@ acres give ( mostly older ) games the M@@ yst@@ ery Science Theater treatment , are already popular on YouTube .
The point is , YouTube comes up a lot when descri@@ bing Twi@@ tch , so the news that YouTube was acqu@@ iring Twi@@ tch was gre@@ eted with a y@@ a@@ wn , a text@@ book example of an ent@@ ren@@ ched tech company buying out a potential competi@@ tor .
It &apos;s a myst@@ ery why the deal with YouTube fell through , considering it was re@@ porte@@ dly willing to pay no less than Ama@@ zon .
All we have at the moment is this statement from Twi@@ tch CEO E@@ mm@@ ett S@@ hear : &quot; We chose Ama@@ zon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . &quot;
Another myst@@ ery , frank@@ ly , is Twi@@ tch &apos;s incredible success .
To sno@@ bs like me who declare that they &apos;d rather play sports than watch them , it &apos;s hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself .
It &apos;s one thing to look over your friend &apos;s shoulder at 3 in the morning as she cre@@ ep@@ s through Re@@ sident E@@ vi@@ l , and quite another to watch some r@@ ando get 20 head@@ shots in a row in Call of D@@ uty .
All the games you could be watching right now .
Another problem is that many of today &apos;s most popular games are first-@@ person , so watching foot@@ age of them , without controlling the view@@ point yourself , can be a Do It Ri@@ ght-@@ worthy recip@@ e for a head@@ ache .
I conc@@ ede that spee@@ dr@@ uns , in which the Ro@@ ger B@@ ann@@ ist@@ ers of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are enter@@ taining .
But unless someone is a virtu@@ o@@ so at gaming or hum@@ our , his Twi@@ tch channel isn &apos;t likely to be all that interesting .
But what do scep@@ tics like me know ?
Twi@@ tch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the four@@ th-@@ largest source of peak internet traffic .
How , exactly , will Ama@@ zon capitali@@ se on this ?
It &apos;s hard to imagine Twi@@ tch being fol@@ ded into Ama@@ zon Inst@@ ant Video as elegan@@ tly as YouTube could have just s@@ wal@@ lowed Twi@@ tch .
But Twi@@ tch has something any company would love to attract : hor@@ des of adverti@@ ser-@@ co@@ v@@ eted young men .
As Twi@@ tch chief S@@ hear said , Ama@@ zon and Twi@@ tch &quot; are both belie@@ vers in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no sign of shr@@ in@@ king , even - gul@@ p - as a spec@@ t@@ ator sport .
Some@@ thing is happening on the bo@@ un@@ cy castle at the Burg@@ gar@@ ten@@ fest ( castle garden festival ) .
The organiz@@ ers &apos; idea was right .
Despite the heavy down@@ pour of rain on Saturday evening , approximately 1200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden .
Ad@@ mission had to be stopped on occasion .
&quot; It was anno@@ ying &quot; , according to R@@ on S@@ em , one of the organiz@@ ers .
Salz@@ we@@ del lights and fun .
Max@@ im Sach@@ ra@@ j and R@@ on S@@ em co@@ ined the name &quot; Ar@@ mul@@ a &quot; from two Spanish words .
Since the open air castle garden in Salz@@ we@@ del was supposed to be@@ am out bright lights during the wide range of day@@ time and evening shows .
Well , you make your own fun anyway .
This was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air .
The organiz@@ ers promised a festival fit for all generations .
And that is what they delivered .
Around the supplies stand located in the me@@ ado@@ ws of the castle garden , people from Salz@@ we@@ del , but also guests from near and far , made themselves at home .
They followed the first live performance , ta@@ pped their feet in time , and enjoyed re@@ fresh@@ ments . In short : P@@ ure relaxation and enjoyment .
And that goes for all generations .
Whilst some people spra@@ w@@ led out on blan@@ k@@ ets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar , which had been car@@ ted in especially , others indul@@ ged in a glass of wine in the wine store , and the kids went cra@@ zy on the bo@@ un@@ cy castle , which was a huge attraction for the little guests .
However , even the children &apos;s face painting kept the volunteers &apos; hands full , in the stric@@ test meaning of the word , as the children rus@@ hed to become men , and con@@ j@@ ure up fan@@ ci@@ ful cre@@ ations on their small faces .
The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a sk@@ at@@ ebo@@ ard workshop , which the Goo@@ d@@ foot@@ -@@ Crew from Salz@@ we@@ del had organized .
And then the rain came .
Shor@@ tly before 5 : 30 PM the rain pel@@ ted down onto the visitors ; and families did a run@@ ner in search of somewhere dry .
Despite this , the festival &apos;s attractions did not get called off .
&quot; More people than expected came &quot; , Rom S@@ em said , who called the event a &quot; success all round &quot; .
As such , nothing is going to stop them from repe@@ ating the big party next year .
Even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event , the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for S@@ em .
He said that one anno@@ ying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily .
Appar@@ ently not enough security guards had been booked with the security company .
The consequence : Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds .
Feedback has been very good .
In a preliminary and cau@@ tious estim@@ ation , the Salz@@ we@@ del co-@@ organiz@@ er estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden .
There were problems with the sound engineering .
The hip hop band from Salz@@ we@@ del , Blo@@ cks &apos; n &apos; Ro@@ x , abandoned their performance somewhat un@@ ner@@ ved by these problems .
The engineers could not get a half-@@ decent sound out of it .
A sh@@ ish@@ a lounge had been planned but could not be built because the t@@ ents could not be delivered to Salz@@ we@@ del due to a pun@@ c@@ ture .
The organiz@@ er insi@@ sted that &quot; they will , however , be there next year &quot; .
The premi@@ er of the Am@@ ul@@ a-@@ Open@@ -@@ Air@@ s was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors .
And that was with bad weather .
Nevertheless , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes , which will be exc@@ used as it was their first time , but which have to be avoided next time round .
The event organiz@@ ers also had to accept criticism on the social networking site Facebook .
&quot; Sor@@ ry , but for twelve euros , I really expected more &quot; , Mel@@ an@@ ie Mei@@ er comm@@ ented on the event &apos;s page .
&quot; Unfortunately , you bit off more than you could che@@ w &quot; , according to E@@ le Zimmer@@ mann on the same page .
For others , the te@@ e@@ thing problems were not such a big issue .
I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rub@@ b@@ ish , but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running .
H@@ ats off ! &quot; , Steph@@ an@@ ie Jen@@ ß wrote about Am@@ ula .
Now the organiz@@ ers have a year &apos;s time to address these criticisms .
New ra@@ dar d@@ ome in Ber@@ k@@ um : Wach@@ t@@ berg &apos;s land@@ mark d@@ wind@@ les
And not as one would expect .
In fact , the structural element , which is ready , is waiting to be installed onto the structure .
But this is just one of many things that need doing : Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation ra@@ dar T@@ IR@@ A , the case , known as the ra@@ dar d@@ ome , is to be completely re@@ built .
With a diameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters , the new ra@@ dar d@@ ome will be somewhat smaller than the old one .
That said , the size will still be a world record .
The final phase in completing the new case is to change the cap
The top quarter of the old case will be separated and li@@ fted by a c@@ ran@@ e .
After that , the last quarter of the new case will be put in place .
As long as the weather is on their side , this should take place at the start of this week .

Will the Burg@@ ver@@ eine ( castle clubs ) get back together again ?
Recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
The bo@@ ard@@ room is now con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating the possibility of working together .
As an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , the dec@@ e@@ ased Richard Dim@@ bath , the former chair@@ men of Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Burg@@ fre@@ unde ( Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen castle friends ) , led the project in the French Gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
Up until a year ago , there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
Their points of view are now mark@@ edly different with regard to how the history of Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled .
Now the two are coming together : There should soon be talks about a joint venture .
Tor@@ sten S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( castle club ) and Her@@ bert Pi@@ ff@@ l ( castle friends ) , both members of the board , confirmed this in answer to our newspaper &apos;s query .
&quot; I have rung Mr Pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we get together &quot; , S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg reported .
In his opinion , all members of each club could come together again in the future .
This would enable quick@@ er and more visible success to be achieved .
W@@ here@@ as the castle friends , and the recently dec@@ e@@ ased Richard Dim@@ bath right up until the bitter end , had their eyes on re@@ construc@@ ting the castle in the mountain forest , the castle club , with S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg , want to &quot; develop and bring the premises to life &quot; in its original place .
Her@@ bert Pi@@ ff@@ l , the dep@@ uty chairman of castle friends , said himself that he was very pleased about the call .
He has been pre@@ sid@@ ing over castle friends since the death of Dim@@ bath .
A new chair@@ person will be found mid September during a members &apos; meeting .
At the moment , the club has around 40 members according to the 74 year old .
&quot; After the death of my friend , Richard Dim@@ bath , we ad@@ jour@@ ned the club &apos;s activities initially out of respect &quot; . This &quot; period of thought &quot; has been necessary to &quot; think about how it can proceed &quot; .
According to Pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chair@@ person will then enter into discussions with the castle club .
Until then , the castle friends can get on with the current atmosp@@ her@@ ic picture within their group .
Pi@@ ff@@ l said that , at the moment , they still do not have a candidate for the chair .
&quot; However , I am confident that we will find someone &quot; . He himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad T@@ öl@@ z .
The new chair@@ person should be in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
The man from T@@ öl@@ z would , however , &quot; like to continue working with them &quot; on the project .
The different points of view on the subject of reconstruction will continue to exist for some time in Pi@@ ff@@ l &apos;s eyes .
He acknowled@@ ges Dim@@ bath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; , who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar projects , which are well under way in Austria and France , show that this idea is no easy task .
But with a high number of participants among the population , as well as some volunteers from all over the world , it will become a tourist mag@@ net .
Pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; Even I was skep@@ tical at first .
However , with time , I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project &quot; . It could create a &quot; unique characteristic &quot; for the city of ra@@ fts@@ men .
Otherwise , there is nothing here .
In addition , the project would be financed by EU grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , Pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; The idea of reconstruction is , therefore , something that I personally do not want to simply abandon . He hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat .
Their aim to first of all document the history &quot; is important and good &quot; .
Then , we will see .
Smart ways to save on college text@@ books
With the cost of college text@@ books sur@@ passing $ 1,000 a year for many students , so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be s@@ op@@ hom@@ ore Mat@@ t Sch@@ ro@@ eder came up with a smart way to tri@@ m costs .
He worked out a system of borro@@ wing books from up@@ per@@ class@@ men , offering nom@@ inal compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
&quot; My calcul@@ us book that usually costs $ 180 , I got for the sem@@ ester for $ 10 and a Chi@@ ck-@@ fil@@ -@@ A bis@@ cu@@ it , &quot; says Sch@@ ro@@ eder , 19 , who atten@@ ds Co@@ ven@@ ant College in Georgia .
Re@@ qui@@ red texts for his last sem@@ ester would have cost $ 4@@ 30 , he says .
He spent $ 120 .
The College Board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,@@ 200 a year on text@@ books and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
Online out@@ lets and creative approaches like Sch@@ ro@@ eder &apos;s are increasingly the go@@ -@@ to choices for students .
R@@ enting text@@ books is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the sem@@ ester , often at a significant discount to buying .
Ne@@ eb@@ o Inc , which operates more than 250 camp@@ us book@@ stores , says text@@ book rentals have doub@@ led since 2011 .
Industry research shows that about one-@@ fourth of books at college book@@ stores in this past spring sem@@ ester were r@@ ented , says Ne@@ eb@@ o Vice President Tre@@ vor Me@@ yer .
Fe@@ wer than half of all texts are purchased at camp@@ us book@@ stores , according to the National Association of College Sto@@ res trade association .
Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal .
Bu@@ ying online
Some new book prices can be one-@@ third of what you might find at the camp@@ us book@@ store if you go online .
The n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; by R@@ on Lar@@ son , Bru@@ ce Ed@@ wards , and Robert Host@@ et@@ ler carries a list price of nearly $ 2@@ 90 but can be purchased new for $ 23@@ 9.@@ 99 at speci@@ alty text@@ book re@@ ta@@ iler Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com .
Bu@@ ying used
If you do not mind other people &apos;s notes or wear and te@@ ar , used texts are a good option .
&quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; is selling for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 used on Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com .
Mat@@ t Cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , a senior at Bri@@ g@@ ham Young University , says he had paid 42 c@@ ents on Ama@@ zon@@ .com for a used copy of &quot; Strategi@@ c Media Deci@@ sions : Under@@ standing The Business End Of The Ad@@ verti@@ sing Business . &quot;
The book was selling for $ 48 new .
Aca@@ dem@@ ics like In@@ grid Bra@@ c@@ ey , director of the University of Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts at Am@@ her@@ st &apos;s College Without W@@ alls , suggest students check with their prof@@ essors to see if previous edi@@ tions are acceptable .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the class@@ work .
If so , old edi@@ tions can often be found for a tiny fra@@ ction of the cost of the latest version .
Besides Ch@@ egg and Ama@@ zon , eBay Inc &apos;s Hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
R@@ enting
R@@ enting your text@@ books is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
For example , a student could rent &quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for the length of the sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
K@@ now the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes , highlighting , or wear and te@@ ar .
R@@ enter , be@@ ware : If you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
E-@@ books
Get@@ ting e-@@ books instead of traditional texts is another option .
Sometimes those books are essentially r@@ ented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Ama@@ zon@@ .com , Ch@@ egg and Bar@@ nes &amp; Nob@@ le Inc .
Ch@@ egg will rent &quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for six months for about $ 61 .
Bra@@ c@@ ey says students in literature classes can often find the best bar@@ gains since many classi@@ cs are now available to download for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
No matter what , shop around .
Jo@@ e G@@ ault , 29 , who is about to enter Pep@@ per@@ dine Law School , recommends using the IS@@ B@@ N number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
Before ordering online , G@@ ault says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
He learned that lesson the hard way .
A book he purchased was back@@ -@@ ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college book@@ store .
Why the Gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the Galax@@ y couldn &apos;t save the box office
Sy@@ lv@@ ester St@@ all@@ one &apos;s The Ex@@ pend@@ ables 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while S@@ in City : A Dame to K@@ ill For has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
The Cam@@ eron Di@@ az vehicle Sex Tap@@ e took only $ 14.@@ 6 million in its opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as How To Train Your Dra@@ gon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns .
An article from Tele@@ graph film cri@@ tic Rob@@ bie Col@@ lin indicates that , when it comes to children &apos;s movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
Col@@ lin called 2014 the &quot; the worst &quot; year yet for children &apos;s films , and described How To Train Your Dra@@ gon 2 as a merely &quot; functional &quot; fantas@@ y sequ@@ el .
But when it comes to film pit@@ ched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
In July , Entertainment Week@@ ly compared the average Cin@@ ema@@ Sc@@ ore and Met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2@@ ,000 screens between May &apos;s Mem@@ orial Day holiday and July 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
The results , which take the opinion of both cinema audi@@ ences and film critics into account , suggest that this year &apos;s crop of films are of similar cali@@ bre last year &apos;s h@@ its .
Some comm@@ ent@@ ators have suggested that changing viewing hab@@ its and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Net@@ fli@@ x may be to blame .
Director J@@ on F@@ av@@ reau , who is currently working on Disney &apos;s forthcoming Jung@@ le Book film , told the website Hollywood Re@@ porter : &quot; I think times are changing . &quot;
We have to acknowledge that and not try to ch@@ ase what used to be .
In contrast to Hollywood &apos;s current box office sl@@ ump , Net@@ fli@@ x recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $ 1.@@ 2@@ bn , almost doub@@ ling last year &apos;s figure of $ 8@@ 3@@ 7@@ m .
Last summer , director Ste@@ ven Spiel@@ berg criticised studios for rel@@ ying too much on com@@ ic book fran@@ ch@@ ises , and predic@@ ted a Hollywood &quot; mel@@ t@@ down . &quot;
In light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators are argu@@ ing that his di@@ re pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y may have held some truth to it .
With summer 2015 set to us@@ her in a s@@ late of potential big box office h@@ its , including A@@ ven@@ gers : Age of Ul@@ tr@@ on , Mini@@ ons and Ju@@ ras@@ sic World , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic .
X-@@ Men producer Simon Kin@@ berg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply &quot; cy@@ c@@ lical , &quot; telling Hollywood Re@@ porter : &quot; Next summer will be the biggest bo@@ x-@@ office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . &quot;
A few years ago , when the second table tennis regional division was can@@ cel@@ ed in an attempt to stream@@ line the le@@ ag@@ ues , a step in the right directions was taken .
Now , the German table tennis association has introduced an additional , third le@@ ague into the program .
The consequence : Any team that has not been promoted , has been dem@@ oted .
For example , Gö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s top class team , Tor@@ pe@@ do , avoided demo@@ tion in the premi@@ er le@@ ague re@@ leg@@ ation , but will now play in the fifth division as of next season .
The Tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s women &apos;s team remain in the fourth division despite their superb cle@@ an-@@ swe@@ ep in the Regional@@ lig@@ a .
The Tor@@ pe@@ do boys and girls are starting in the Lower Sax@@ ony lig@@ a , just like the l@@ ads from SC We@@ ende .
The S@@ G L@@ eng@@ lern and Tor@@ pe@@ do reserves are step@@ ping up into the new Verb@@ and@@ s@@ lig@@ a , but there are no longer any clubs from Gö@@ tt@@ ing@@ ern in the Landes@@ lig@@ a .
For the women , T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar does play in the Verb@@ and@@ s@@ lig@@ a , and the Tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s second team plays in the Landes@@ lig@@ a .
From a structural point of view , this seems to be a better regional division , when in fact , it is just the new Southern Regional Premier League .
Ste@@ pping up into this are : T@@ SV Se@@ ul@@ ingen , V@@ f@@ B Lö@@ ding@@ sen , Tor@@ pe@@ do III , Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Ein@@ beck , Ham@@ men@@ st@@ edt , Bo@@ ven@@ der SV , Lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , FC Wes@@ er and TT@@ C .
D@@ ran@@ s@@ feld and SC We@@ ende represent the area in the regional le@@ ague , whereas TT@@ C II , Rot@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß , Bo@@ ven@@ der SV II and T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar II and III represent the area in the regional division . The Regional Premier League for women is at least ki@@ cking off with a good start .
G@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , TT@@ C and T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar II are all here as part of the party .
In the regional le@@ ague , Tor@@ pe@@ do III and S@@ atten@@ hausen / W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen are taking to the field .
With each of the nine teams
SC We@@ ende sends a girl into the small regional le@@ ague .
Even the regional le@@ ague &apos;s rela@@ y team for SC@@ W boys , which is where Tor@@ pe@@ do II is also starting , is not complete .
As for the regional division , Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Tus@@ po We@@ ende and Bo@@ ven@@ der SV are heading into their season .
In the first season of the new@@ ly-@@ founded regional association , both district divisions from Gö@@ tt@@ ingen are starting out with each of the nine teams .
As for the West rela@@ y team ; that is made up of Rot@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß II , Bo@@ ven@@ der SV III , Lau@@ bach II , Tor@@ pe@@ do IV and V , M@@ TV Gr@@ one , D@@ ran@@ s@@ felder SC II , M@@ iel@@ en@@ hausen and S@@ G L@@ eng@@ lern II .
S@@ atten@@ hausen / W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , Nikol@@ aus@@ berg and Land@@ ol@@ f@@ sh@@ au@@ sen are some of the teams making up the East rela@@ y team .
The women &apos;s district division is made up of S@@ atten@@ hausen / W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen II , Bil@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , Hem@@ eln , Se@@ ul@@ ingen II , Tus@@ po We@@ ende and S@@ G R@@ hum@@ e .
That is much better than the district of Oster@@ ode , where there are no longer any female teams at a district level .
It is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their potential . The innovative and bu@@ st@@ ling district committee are going to have to come up with something .
Nat@@ o summit : First protests in New@@ port and Cardiff
There have been protests over the weekend by those opposed to the Nat@@ o summit in New@@ port .
On Saturday , hundreds gathered in New@@ port city centre for an anti-@@ Nat@@ o mar@@ ch .
And on Sunday in Cardiff , around 150 people came together at Cardiff &apos;s county hall for what was described as a counter-@@ summit .
Stephen Fair@@ cl@@ ough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to prote@@ sters who have trav@@ elled from Bri@@ d@@ gend to Belgium .
Te@@ ens air@@ li@@ fted from Blue Mountains
TW@@ O teen@@ age bus@@ h@@ wal@@ kers have been win@@ ched to safety after spending the night str@@ anded in the N@@ S@@ W Blue Mountains .
THE 16-@@ year-old girl and 18-@@ year-old man went hiking just after mid@@ day on Sunday at Go@@ v@@ etts Le@@ ap in Black@@ he@@ ath .
Conc@@ ern@@ ed relatives called police about 8@@ pm when they ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t returned home .
A search party involving local police and rescue squ@@ ad was sent out and the pair were found about 11@@ pm near Bri@@ dal V@@ eil Falls .

Anti-@@ government protests escal@@ ate in Pakistan
Around 1000 prote@@ sters have been forced out of the P@@ TV buildings by soldiers , according to the Minister of Information , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hi@@ d .
After a good half an hour or so , the station began broadcasting again .
The director of P@@ TV , Ath@@ ar Far@@ oo@@ q , said that demonstr@@ ators armed with sti@@ cks had damaged equipment in the edi@@ torial offices .
There was no mentioned of the number of people killed or injured .
The demonstr@@ ators are demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Head of Government , acc@@ using him of vote ri@@ gging .
The police announced that on Monday , around one kilom@@ eter away from the residence of the Prime Minister , Na@@ wa@@ z Sh@@ ari@@ f , approximately 3000 demonstr@@ ators clas@@ hed with security forces .
According to statements released by the hospital , a police officer was injured .
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstr@@ ators attempted to gain access to Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
They are demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Prime Minister .
Following a meeting in the army &apos;s headquarters on Sunday evening , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , stating there was &quot; no time to waste or a need to use violence &quot; .
The statement also announced that : &quot; The army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the State &quot; .
The escal@@ ating violence stir@@ red up concern that the military may have to intervene , a military that has already revol@@ ted on many occasions in the past .
The above protests , led by Im@@ ran Kh@@ an , an opposition politi@@ cian , and Ta@@ hi@@ ru@@ l Q@@ ad@@ ri , a pre@@ acher , have been ongoing since independence day on 14 August .
Sh@@ ari@@ f is ref@@ using to step down .
On Sunday Kh@@ an and Q@@ ad@@ ri called upon their supporters to per@@ severe .
&quot; We will not leave until we have forced Sh@@ ari@@ f to re@@ sign &quot; , Kh@@ an said .
Q@@ ad@@ ri made similar comments :
Kh@@ an acc@@ uses Sh@@ ari@@ f of having frau@@ dul@@ ently won the parliamentary vote last May .
Q@@ ad@@ ri is demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of both the central and provin@@ cial governments .
A provi@@ sional government should then reform the voting system , and call new elections .
More than 40@@ ,000 members of the security forces have been deployed to protect the government district .
At first , the demonstr@@ ators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament building . Then , at the weekend , Kh@@ an and Q@@ ad@@ ri called upon them to force entry into Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
After its second win of the season , H@@ üt@@ tel@@ dorf is in third place on the table .
A bitter week came to an end for Rap@@ id on Sunday with a 2 : 0 win over Grö@@ dig .
Co@@ ach Z@@ or@@ an B@@ ari@@ sic , whose team reached an interim low at the end of the Europa League on Thursday , said that &quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating &quot; .
The cap@@ tain and go@@ al@@ keep@@ er , Ste@@ ffen Hof@@ mann , who clim@@ bed up to third place with Grün@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß , confirmed that &quot; the sense of achievement was extremely important &quot; .
Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel &apos;s dream goal has led Rap@@ id on to a road to victory . Two winning seasons show that Rap@@ id have re@@ acted in the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki , and they reach the end of the international season with hei@@ gh@@ tened mor@@ ale .
&quot; We wanted to show a positive reaction &quot; , the def@@ ender Thomas Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel said , whose magnificent and sk@@ ill@@ ful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course .
&quot; I thought I &apos;d build up all of the fru@@ stration from Thursday , and sm@@ ash@@ ed it into the top of the net &quot; , the 26@@ -@@ year old said sm@@ iling .
13th of November 2010 was , until now , the last time that Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel had sco@@ red in a team from the Bundes@@ lig@@ a , and that was with Ri@@ ed .
His first champ@@ ion@@ ships goal at Rap@@ i@@ d-@@ Dres@@ s will , therefore , always be a special memory for him .
&quot; That is something quite special for me , I am Rap@@ id off@@ spring &quot; , Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel said .
Due to Mario P@@ av@@ eli@@ c &apos;s recent pel@@ vis injury , Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel moved from playing left back to right back , where he also did a very good job .
He had enough experience to be able to play in the mir@@ ro@@ red position .
He deser@@ ved the goal , B@@ ari@@ sic stated . He has already achieved some assi@@ sts this year .
The team shows character . Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel also cro@@ ssed the ball over to Hof@@ mann after the first hour , which led to the decisive 2 : 0 victory .
But before that , even the fans could have kept the score .
&quot; Thank God we had some luck today &quot; , Sch@@ ra@@ m@@ mel noted , all@@ u@@ ding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks : &quot; The results were not justified , but the games were always better when compared to last year &quot; .
B@@ ari@@ sic even decided that the team had previously played &quot; better in other games than today &quot; , and against &quot; the strongest team to play in the stadium this season &quot; .
These are the first three points since 26@@ th July , and therefore prove that the structure of the team is in@@ tact despite the set@@ backs : &quot; Today , my team has shown that they have character &quot; .
For him , what is just as pleas@@ ing is : &quot; The fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again &quot; .
A lot of work was done during the internal football break . The unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of Bri@@ an B@@ ehr@@ endt , Mario P@@ av@@ eli@@ c , Christop@@ her Di@@ bon , Den@@ i Al@@ ar and Michael Sch@@ imp@@ els@@ berger , as well as the fact that S@@ r@@ d@@ jan Gra@@ ho@@ va@@ c , Stefan St@@ ang@@ l and Phili@@ pp Scho@@ bes@@ berger joined the first team , is what makes this success all the more valuable .
&quot; We must not forget that &quot; , B@@ ari@@ sic said , who has lost players in the last three days , including B@@ ehr@@ endt and P@@ av@@ eli@@ c , &quot; who recently were very stable &quot; .
The international football break therefore has to be used &quot; to lick wo@@ unds and to improve physi@@ cally a bit &quot; , B@@ ari@@ sic explained , who has five under 2@@ 1@@ s in his ranks .
For one of whom , cap@@ tain Hof@@ mann , the break came in particularly useful .
He ben@@ ds over back@@ wards for the team , ignor@@ ing any pain .
Especially during these difficult times , he showed that he is a very important player for us &quot; , B@@ ari@@ sic stated .
Before being sub@@ stituted in the 68@@ th minute , Hof@@ mann not only gave structure to Rap@@ id &apos;s game , but also sco@@ red the second goal .
For the 3@@ 3-@@ year old , who played his 3@@ 50@@ th game in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a , it was his first goal since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 against Ad@@ mir@@ a ) .
Hof@@ mann : &quot; We must not think that all is now well &quot; . &quot; I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side , but , at some point , that luck had to come back to us .
It was high time &quot; , Hof@@ mann said .
Of course , he spoke about focused and continued work : &quot; You don &apos;t have to always see things black and white .
We haven &apos;t been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be .
However , we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t think that all is now well .
His importance to the team is something that he could not deny .
After all , it is a very young team , which , I am able to help at the moment .
They hold on to me in certain phases &quot; , Hof@@ mann said .
Grö@@ dig &apos;s coach , Michael Bau@@ r and his team have little to blame themselves for .
He is sorry about the quick counter goal , descri@@ bing it as &quot; a kind of magic goal &quot; , as well as the normal goal sco@@ red by N@@ utz in the 40@@ th minute , which was wron@@ g@@ fully denied by the refer@@ ee , Kolleg@@ ger .
The only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough up@@ field .
Because we had far to few goals .
Center back , Maxim@@ ili@@ an Kar@@ ner thought the same : &quot; It started off badly , but we then found our feet , and even sco@@ red a goal .
All in all , we could have had more .
Sil@@ ence prev@@ ails bene@@ ath this tre@@ et@@ op
Last Friday , when giving out the pu@@ zzle on the summer series &quot; My piece of R@@ hö@@ n happiness &quot; , we showed a mi@@ ghty tree trun@@ k .
There are still several of these giant trees in the region ; the example shown is the &quot; Gei@@ ss@@ ru@@ hei@@ che &quot; , an o@@ ak tree , which stands above the village of Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n .
A ro@@ cky foot@@ path leads up to the somewhat 600 year old o@@ ak tree .
You walk past en@@ clo@@ sures , bas@@ alt c@@ air@@ ns and a sea of stones .
The tree is located just below the Bau@@ ers@@ berg &apos;s stone quar@@ ry , one kilom@@ eter north of the street to Wei@@ s@@ bach .
The natural monument looks energe@@ tic ; it towers above the other trees in the area , and , being more than eight meters in size , it remin@@ ds you of an American giant Sequ@@ o@@ ia .
A small Budd@@ ha on top of a tree stu@@ b indicates that this is a spiritual or my@@ stic place .
Despite intensive research , there are only clu@@ es to the origins of the name .
Dr Wolfgang Schnei@@ der has , once again , consulted the Bisch@@ of@@ sh@@ ei@@ m Archi@@ ves , and asked elderly people from Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n in order to find out what it has to do with the Gei@@ ss@@ ru@@ hei@@ che .
The results of his investigation revealed a less color@@ ful explanation of the name .
According to his research , up to around 80 years ago , the go@@ at her@@ ders are said to have led their animals out of Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n along the ar@@ du@@ ous , cle@@ ared and st@@ on@@ eless me@@ ado@@ ws .
The her@@ ds@@ men , exhau@@ sted after the as@@ cent , re@@ sted at the foot of the tree .
Since then , the area has won back its significance , because her@@ ds of go@@ ats , once again gra@@ zing the me@@ ado@@ ws .
In addition , Schnei@@ der also discovered that the region has been declared the core area in the bio@@ sphere reserve .
One should exercise caution when tre@@ ading over the mass of stone because the sun@@ -@@ war@@ med bas@@ alt is also a popular where@@ ab@@ outs for the European vi@@ per .
A hiking trail leads from Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n up to the tree , but it is somewhat hidden .
Further trails are sign@@ posted , which lead up towards Hoch@@ r@@ hö@@ n and offer an extensive hi@@ ke .
Where is the mo@@ ated castle ?
A mo@@ ated castle , which we looked for as part of our next challenge , is , of course , rather hard to find way up high .
The reflection in the mo@@ at already provides a good impression of the structure , but we do have some historical buildings in the district , and the building portra@@ it may just be a good example of this .
Where is our &quot; piece of R@@ hö@@ n happiness &quot; ?

After weeks of verb@@ al w@@ ran@@ g@@ ling Italy &apos;s Premier - and sitting EU-@@ Chairman - Mat@@ te@@ o R@@ enz@@ i , has managed to push through his nom@@ ination of his foreign minister , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , as head of EU@@ - Foreign Policy , despite strong conservative opposition at the special EU summit . She will be the successor of the Britain , Ca@@ ther@@ ine Ashton .
R@@ enz@@ i ob@@ serves how the govern@@ ment-@@ friendly daily newspaper , La Rep@@ ub@@ b@@ lica , describes the appointment of Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who was also seen as the favourite by the government , as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and of his own position in the EU .
He expects it to provide a boost for his &quot; Reform Package &quot; in Italy .
R@@ enz@@ i hopes , not least , to be able to thus qu@@ ieten the left-@@ wing party basis which is always stir@@ ring against him , for Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini is considered to be one of their group - albeit one of the more moderate .
In opposition to the conservative representatives , Commission President Jean-@@ Claude Jun@@ cker and the P@@ ole Donald Tus@@ k , who was named as Council President , were voted in , so the prev@@ ailing opinion in Rome , in order to achieve a political balance .
For the Chief Diplom@@ at of the EU will also serve as the Dep@@ uty to Commission President Jun@@ cker .
The agreement of the EU-@@ Parliament is considered to be safely secured .
If this were not the case , then State President Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ poli@@ tano would hardly have called the nom@@ ination of the 41 year-old politi@@ cian from the ruling Democratic Party ( P@@ D ) &quot; an important recognition &quot; of the role of Italy in the EU .
La Rep@@ ub@@ b@@ lica is optimistic that Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who has held high office over two decades in different governments , and who is known for her ambition , will be able to meet the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
The woman , who was born in Rome , is married and has two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
The qualified doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democra@@ tic@@ i di S@@ ini@@ stra ( left wing demo@@ crats ) , which mer@@ ged with the ca@@ tho@@ lic centre party , Mar@@ gh@@ er@@ ita , in 2008 , to form today &apos;s social democratic party ( P@@ D ) .
In 1999 Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini became Vice President for three years of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth .
The election of 2001 saw her take high office with a place on the council of the Left W@@ ing Democrats , working in the foreign policy department and then becoming its head .
She was responsible for traditional cornerst@@ ones of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East ; became known for her preparatory work to the operation of NATO in Afghanistan , in which Italy has a participating cont@@ ingent ; and she promoted relations with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA .
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , in which she serves as an expert on Defence and European and International Affairs .
When R@@ enz@@ i became Premier in February 2014 , he appointed Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini as his Foreign Minister .
If the P@@ D today enjoys a better relationship with the strong freedom movement in the country , which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes for the Party in the EU elections , then it was Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini who played a leading role in that , as is strongly believed in P@@ D circles .
The claims in Brussels that the new EU-@@ Foreign Minister has too little diplomatic experience and therefore lacks cl@@ out , is re@@ but@@ ted by the P@@ D .
In Brussels , the realistic stance taken by Lo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini in the Ukrainian crisis have been attacked and den@@ ig@@ rated , particularly by the Polish members and those representing the Baltic States .
She is a suppor@@ ter of Pi@@ peline South Stream , run by the Russian firm Gas@@ pro@@ m , through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe , by-@@ passing Ukraine . This will also make Italy &apos;s own energy secure .
After R@@ enz@@ i had assumed his position as EU-@@ Chairman in July , Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini emb@@ ark@@ ed on her first state visit to Moscow .
Photos showing her sha@@ king hands with Putin were received in Brussels with indi@@ gn@@ ation , as was the fact that she invited the Krem@@ lin chief to an economic summit in Milan in October .
A total of nine people began their training course on Monday , at em@@ z-@@ Han@@ auer in N@@ ab@@ burg .
They include a tra@@ ine@@ e , who had already completed another course in the same company .
The new tra@@ ine@@ e employees will receive training for four future job areas : Electronics engineers ( three tra@@ ine@@ es ) ; me@@ chat@@ ron@@ ics engineers or technici@@ ans ( two ) ; tool mechan@@ ics ( two ) and process engineers ( two ) .
All the tra@@ ine@@ es come from the county of Sch@@ wand@@ or@@ f : Tob@@ ias Brau@@ n and Thomas Bü@@ cher@@ l from Schwarz@@ ach , Stefan Bri@@ ck@@ l and Flori@@ an Re@@ wi@@ tz@@ er from Sch@@ mid@@ ga@@ den , Johannes Be@@ er from Ne@@ un@@ burg vor@@ m Wald , Feli@@ x Doma@@ ier from Ober@@ vie@@ ch@@ ta@@ ch , Daniel Sor@@ gen@@ frei and Sebastian Zah@@ ner from P@@ fre@@ im@@ d , as well as Fer@@ din@@ and Stre@@ b@@ l from Te@@ un@@ z .
The new tra@@ ine@@ es had previously attended middle and junior high schools .
From Wednesday until Friday , the tra@@ ine@@ es of all the various ages were going to a Team Building event in Ober@@ am@@ mer@@ gau , which included among other things an all-@@ day hi@@ ke and ra@@ fting on the Inn River .
The company has 4@@ 35 employees throughout Germany and 9@@ 50 worldwide .
The number of tra@@ ine@@ es across all age-@@ groups tot@@ als 27 .
France &apos;s Socialists should &apos; shut up and sort France out &apos; , Fran@@ co@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de &apos;s key ally says
Mr V@@ alls called on the deeply divided Left to &quot; show its affec@@ tion &quot; for the emb@@ att@@ led Socialist president , whose re@@ sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French .
The president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ ality , he deserves our support .
&quot; It is our duty to remain at his sides , &quot; he said , to ap@@ plause .
As a plac@@ atory gest@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted his government would not call into question France &apos;s controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour working week , despite infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Em@@ manu@@ el Mac@@ ron , the new economy minister .
On Saturday , Mr Hol@@ lan@@ de had imp@@ lored his fellow Socialists to remain &quot; united &quot; with the government .
But Christi@@ ane Tau@@ bir@@ a , the justice minister , put a spann@@ er in the works by turning up to a meeting of re@@ bel Socialist MP@@ s and critic@@ ising the Socialist Party for letting the French &quot; lose faith in their future . &quot;
Marine Le P@@ en , the far-@@ Right National Front leader , he@@ ap@@ ed sc@@ orn on the Socialists &apos; constant in-@@ fighting by saying she did not see the new V@@ alls government lasting more than just a few months .
Fran@@ co@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de the Emperor has no clothes , but neither has Prince Manuel V@@ alls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one didn &apos;t even survive the summer .
&quot; And the new one won &apos;t survive the fall or the winter either , &quot; Mis@@ s Le P@@ en told supporters .
She reiter@@ ated her party &apos;s call for a parliamentary dis@@ solution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to go@@ vern .
France &apos;s ruling party suffered a dru@@ b@@ bing in March municipal elections and the far-@@ right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May .
A pol@@ l in Sunday &apos;s Journal du Dim@@ anche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several ri@@ val fac@@ tions before the end of Mr Hol@@ lan@@ de &apos;s presidential term in 20@@ 17 .
Pas@@ cal Per@@ r@@ ine@@ au , a political scienti@@ st at Sciences P@@ o university , warned the French would fast lose pati@@ ence unless the new Socialist government succ@@ ee@@ ds in improving the economy and record unemployment .
&quot; It has a small window of opportunity , but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing , &quot; he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could further de@@ generate .
Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise ne@@ ars $ 3 billion Prestige Cru@@ ises deal
Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise Line Hol@@ dings Ltd N@@ CH@@ L@@ .@@ O , the world &apos;s third largest cruise operator , is in advanced talks to acquire pe@@ er Prestige Cru@@ ises International Inc for around $ 3 billion , according to people familiar with the matter .
A deal would give Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise , a company with a market value of $ 6.@@ 8 billion , access to Prestige Cru@@ ises &apos; luxury cruise ships and aff@@ lu@@ ent cli@@ ent@@ ele as it compet@@ es with bigger ri@@ vals Royal Caribbean Cru@@ ises Ltd ( R@@ CL@@ .@@ N ) and Car@@ ni@@ val Cor@@ p ( C@@ CL@@ .@@ N ) .
An agreement may be announced as early as this week , the sources said on Sunday , cau@@ tioning that the talks could still fall apart .
The owner of Prestige Cru@@ ises , private equity firm Ap@@ oll@@ o Global Management LL@@ C ( AP@@ O.@@ N ) , also own@@ s a 20 percent stake in Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise .
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are not public .
Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise and Prestige Cru@@ ises representatives did not respond to requests for comment , while an Ap@@ oll@@ o spo@@ kes@@ man dec@@ lined to comment .
Mi@@ am@@ i-@@ based Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise operates 13 cruise ships in routes spann@@ ing North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic , Central America and the Caribbean .
It had revenues of $ 2.@@ 57 billion in 2013 , up 13 percent from 2012 .
Prestige Cru@@ ises , also based in Mi@@ ami , operates under the O@@ ce@@ ania and Reg@@ ent brands , which together have eight cruise ships traveling to Scandin@@ a@@ via , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
It posted revenues of $ 1.2 billion in 2013 , up 6 percent from the year earlier .
The $ 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India .
Companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators of choice for these new customers .
Prestige Cru@@ ises registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014 .
Ap@@ oll@@ o has been the company &apos;s majority share@@ holder following an $ 8@@ 50 million deal in 2007 .
Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise was created in its current form in 2000 through a mer@@ ger with a cruise operator owned by G@@ enting B@@ h@@ d ( G@@ ENT@@ .@@ K@@ L ) , the leisure and casino con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate controlled by Malay@@ sian billi@@ on@@ aire L@@ im Ko@@ k Th@@ ay .
Ap@@ oll@@ o made a $ 1 billion investment in Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise in 2008 .
Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise went public in January 2013 .
G@@ enting had a 28 percent stake , Ap@@ oll@@ o had a 20 percent stake and private equity firm T@@ PG Capital L@@ P had an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June , according to a regulatory fil@@ ing .
Car@@ ni@@ val , Royal Caribbean Cru@@ ises and Norwe@@ gian Cru@@ ise together account for 82 percent of the North American cruise passenger ber@@ th capacity , according to Prestige Cru@@ ises &apos; initial public offering registration document .
Hong Kong pro-@@ democracy activists h@@ eck@@ le China official day after vote ruling
A group of Beijing loy@@ alists stood nearby wa@@ ving China &apos;s flag .
The N@@ PC Stand@@ ing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong &apos;s 20@@ 17 leadership vote .
All candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nom@@ in@@ ating committee likely to be st@@ ack@@ ed with Beijing loy@@ alists .
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition demo@@ crats to get on the bal@@ lot promp@@ ted pro-@@ democracy activists to rene@@ w their vo@@ w to bring Hong Kong &apos;s financial hub to a halt with &quot; Occ@@ up@@ y Central &quot; protests .
Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong , with China party leaders f@@ ear@@ ful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities .
Following the publication by Beijing of a white paper out@@ lining China &apos;s authority over Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an un@@ official referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands mar@@ ched to the city &apos;s business district and st@@ aged a si@@ t-in .
L@@ i &apos;s brie@@ fing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and China &apos;s Li@@ a@@ ison Office in Hong Kong .
The vice chairman of the Stand@@ ing Committee &apos;s Legisl@@ ative Affairs Commission , Z@@ hang R@@ ong@@ sh@@ un , and the Dep@@ uty Director of the State Council &apos;s Hong Kong and Mac@@ au Affairs Office , Fen@@ g We@@ i , were also due to speak in a series of brie@@ f@@ ings throughout the day .
Stu@@ dent activists said they would gather outside of the Hong Kong chief executive &apos;s office in the afternoon .
Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule .
Putin demands Kie@@ v open &apos; stat@@ eh@@ ood &apos; talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President V@@ ladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease batt@@ ling separ@@ ati@@ sts in the country &apos;s east and immediately begin negotiations on the break@@ away region &apos;s &quot; stat@@ eh@@ ood , &quot; according to Russian news accounts of his remarks .
His spo@@ kes@@ man , D@@ mit@@ ry Pes@@ kov , later clarified that Putin didn &apos;t mean to imp@@ ly that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separ@@ ati@@ st control would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russi@@ an-@@ speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
But Putin &apos;s call upon the Kie@@ v government to negotiate with the pro-@@ Russia insur@@ g@@ ents as equ@@ als correspon@@ ded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : Help the separ@@ ati@@ sts take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proc@@ laimed No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ya region virtual independence to ali@@ gn with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with state-@@ run Channel One television , Putin den@@ ounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held territory in the eastern Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ han@@ sk regions that were sei@@ zed in March and April , after Moscow anne@@ xed Ukraine &apos;s Cri@@ mean peninsula on March 18 .
The Krem@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have lat@@ ely br@@ anded the sei@@ zed territory &quot; No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ya , &quot; or &quot; New Russia , &quot; a term that h@@ ark@@ ens to pre-@@ revolutionary gl@@ ory days of the Russian empire .
Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the off@@ ing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oc@@ t@@ . 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are att@@ acking civilian communities in separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held regions is &quot; a prison@@ er to illu@@ sions , &quot; I@@ tar@@ -T@@ ass reported .
&quot; We must immediately comm@@ ence substan@@ tive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the stat@@ eh@@ ood status of sou@@ theast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , &quot; he said .
Pes@@ kov said Putin &apos;s reference to stat@@ eh@@ ood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kie@@ v leadership as it stru@@ gg@@ les to al@@ lay fears in the Russi@@ an-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Pes@@ kov said .
It &apos;s not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia , Pes@@ kov said , &quot; because it &apos;s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal Ukrainian conflict . &quot;
The Krem@@ lin spo@@ kes@@ man &apos;s inter@@ c@@ ession to correct the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of Putin &apos;s remarks under@@ sco@@ red the Russian leadership &apos;s approach to dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east differently from its ou@@ tri@@ ght sei@@ z@@ ure of Cri@@ me@@ a , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian .
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to an@@ nex even the Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ han@@ sk regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million residents are not Russian and pre-@@ conflict p@@ olls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine .
The autonomy that Russian diplom@@ ats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively hand@@ ing the Krem@@ lin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian main@@ land with Cri@@ me@@ a .
The Black Sea peninsula anne@@ xed five months ago is home to Russia &apos;s main nav@@ al fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts .
The regions between Russia &apos;s Ro@@ sto@@ v area and Cri@@ me@@ a are also home to mines , factories and found@@ ries that produce vital components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed during his inau@@ gu@@ ration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian law@@ makers - after new elections -- wei@@ gh constitutional amendments to give more control to the di@@ spar@@ ate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
But his vision of autonomy appears to differ shar@@ ply from that of the Krem@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st reb@@ els Moscow is accused of ar@@ ming and in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating .
Putin &apos;s latest call on Kie@@ v to deal with the separ@@ ati@@ st leaders as equ@@ als followed new advances by the reb@@ els last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of A@@ zo@@ v .
The Russi@@ an-@@ backed separ@@ ati@@ sts took control of the town of Novo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to sei@@ ze the strategic coastal territory all the way to Cri@@ me@@ a .
That has sp@@ urred a massive civilian and military effort to forti@@ fy Mari@@ u@@ pol , a ste@@ el@@ making port of 500@@ ,000 that lies between Novo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk and the narrow g@@ ateway into the Cri@@ mean peninsula .
Por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian ag@@ gression against Ukraine , a former Soviet re@@ public that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; We are close to the point of no return , &quot; Por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko warned .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit took no definitive action ; the leaders called for drafting more pun@@ ishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an un@@ specified escal@@ ation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lov@@ ay@@ sk after two columns of Russian arm@@ or and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Don@@ et@@ sk region to bol@@ ster the bele@@ agu@@ ered separ@@ ati@@ sts , Col@@ .

Nu@@ de photo scandal em@@ bro@@ ils Australian celeb@@ ri@@ ties and Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o
Ge@@ off@@ rey Edel@@ sten has v@@ ented his dis@@ g@@ ust at h@@ ack@@ ers who may have st@@ olen nu@@ de images of fi@@ anc@@ ee Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o and a who &apos;s who of Hollywood A-@@ li@@ sters .
Tin@@ sel@@ town is re@@ eling after a series of explicit photos showing a nu@@ de J@@ enni@@ fer Law@@ rence hit the internet in a major celeb@@ ri@@ ty h@@ acking scandal .
The h@@ ack@@ er responsible is said to have 60 nu@@ de photos of Hunger Games star Law@@ rence and super@@ stars including models K@@ ate Up@@ ton and Car@@ a Del@@ ev@@ ing@@ ne , sing@@ ers R@@ ih@@ anna , Ari@@ ana Grande and Le@@ a Mich@@ elle and actors Kir@@ sten Dun@@ st .
Australian actors Ter@@ esa Pal@@ mer , E@@ mi@@ ly Bro@@ wn@@ ing , Y@@ von@@ ne Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and Mel@@ bour@@ ne-@@ based Gre@@ ck@@ o also had personal pictures alle@@ ge@@ dly retri@@ e@@ ved due to an i@@ C@@ loud le@@ ak .
There are 101 celeb@@ ri@@ ty names on the list .
Edel@@ sten , who proposed to Gre@@ ck@@ o last month , told Con@@ fi@@ dential : &quot; It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting &quot; .
All private correspon@@ dence and images should remain private .
It &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ceful that personal information can be st@@ olen and disp@@ er@@ sed to others .
Gre@@ ck@@ o , who is in New York , re@@ porte@@ dly told a news website the h@@ acking was &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and those targeted would &quot; feel violated . &quot;
The h@@ ack@@ er is believed to have 30 images of Pal@@ mer with ex-@@ boy@@ friend Scott Spe@@ ed@@ man , including two frames where she is lo@@ ung@@ ing top@@ less in a pool .
Pal@@ mer &apos;s film credits include Love And Hon@@ or , opposite Li@@ am Hem@@ s@@ worth .
Pal@@ mer , Ch@@ u@@ ck star Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and Su@@ cker Pun@@ ch ac@@ tress Bro@@ wn@@ ing yesterday had no comment on the h@@ ack@@ ed pictures .
A representative for Law@@ rence told T@@ M@@ Z : &quot; This is a fla@@ grant violation of privacy . &quot;
Ac@@ tor S@@ eth Ro@@ gen las@@ hed out at the h@@ ack@@ er , t@@ we@@ eting : &quot; Po@@ sting pic@@ s h@@ ack@@ ed from a cell phone is really no different than selling st@@ olen merchan@@ di@@ se . &quot;

Cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ g@@ gers and wal@@ kers took part yesterday in the 8th Cy@@ cling Event on the Gro@@ sser Feld@@ berg mountain , giving their support to &apos; Help for Children with Canc@@ er &apos; .
The Tour was a hard gr@@ ind for some , while others treated it as a light training session .
However , everyone agreed on one thing : It was a lot of fun .
Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski must have sle@@ pt well last night .
For the very first time in his life the head of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel Bre@@ wer@@ y took his bike up the Feld@@ berg .
And for a good cause .
He can put up with a little mus@@ cle sti@@ ff@@ ness , especially since his participation in the 8th Cy@@ cling Event on the Gro@@ sser Fel@@ berg was in aid of the &apos; Help for children with cancer &apos; association , and gave him a valuable personal insight .
A great thing .
&quot; I now know that I can do it - brilliant ! &quot;
You didn &apos;t happen to have a little break to milk the ap@@ plause ?
No , if I &apos;d stopped , I &apos;d never have been able to carry on ...
Like Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski , a member for the CD@@ U in the Ober@@ ur@@ sel town council , many of the 7@@ 18 participants stru@@ gg@@ led in the early mountain de@@ w , coming close to exhaus@@ tion , but arriving happ@@ ily on top of the summit plateau .
On the other hand , some others found it much easier to complete the full ele@@ ven kilomet@@ re route between Ho@@ h@@ emark and Feld@@ berg .
Nor@@ man Di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
The Green Poli@@ ti@@ cian , wearing all red , from the municipal council - red clothes , red bike - looked to be taking it g@@ ently ( &quot; Qu@@ it some professionals here , so it &apos;s all about finishing ! &quot; ) - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without p@@ aus@@ ing for bre@@ ath .
He was another one who did it all in one go , as did N@@ ina Ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ person for the Ober@@ ur@@ sel Council , who did the route along side Frank Grün@@ ei@@ sen .
For both the tri@@ athle@@ tes the &quot; Feld@@ berg Cy@@ cling Event &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; This one is about char@@ ity , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re glad to be here - we &apos;d have gone out riding anyway today , &quot; Ku@@ hn said .
Along the route they met up with Paul W@@ enz@@ el from Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ berg .
The boy ( 12 ) had driven down to Ober@@ us@@ el in the morning , only to immediately go back up again .
Flori@@ an Z@@ ier@@ z from Frankfurt got himself into the s@@ add@@ le at 9 am ; he &quot; did &quot; the Feld@@ berg twice , before then whe@@ eling back home .
Another one who enjoyed himself was &quot; F@@ rit@@ ten-@@ T@@ oni &quot; .
For the manager of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel cul@@ t ki@@ o@@ sk , taking part in cycling events which go over the Feld@@ berg is perfectly natural .
He took just 40 minutes to do the route with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o racing bike .
A mad event .
For this cause I &apos;m very glad to be here , &quot; comm@@ ented Andreas Bal@@ z@@ ke .
The well-@@ conditioned man from Main@@ z said he was an &quot; ambitious racing cy@@ cli@@ st . &quot;
And he must be , since he was riding a &quot; Fi@@ x@@ ie-@@ Bike &quot; which is a bike without ge@@ ars ...
But it wasn &apos;t only cy@@ cli@@ sts who ja@@ un@@ ted to the top - as was evi@@ den@@ ced not only by the 20 wal@@ kers , who clim@@ bed up via the White Wall and the Fu@@ ch@@ stanz , but also by a jo@@ gger who pul@@ led behind him a ty@@ re with wei@@ ghts attached to him by a rop@@ e .
Mountain Res@@ cu@@ e doctor , Professor Vol@@ ker L@@ isch@@ ke , who was there with his team to provide safety , and who was equipped with a four-@@ wheel Bul@@ ly and Qu@@ ad , said : &quot; I know him from Frankfurt - he trains for a specialist s@@ lei@@ gh trail - it &apos;s just that he pul@@ ls the s@@ lei@@ gh himself . &quot; The man is , therefore , in a sense his own s@@ lei@@ gh dog .
The 7@@ 18 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning .
The wal@@ kers started at 9.@@ 30 am .
Then it was the turn of the cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners , who began at 10 am .
Five minutes later the first Mountain@@ -@@ bi@@ kers set off .
B@@ ent Han@@ sen , Chairman of the Association &apos; Cy@@ cling on the Gro@@ sser Feld@@ berg &apos; gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjoyable trip .
Next year , he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the Feld@@ berg .
Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
The relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teh@@ er@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing activities in the Middle East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disp@@ uted two state solution .
Relations between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u have been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
The relationship between the two has further deterior@@ ated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atom@@ ic programme , .
In March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time im@@ pending in Israel .
In 9@@ 11 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Sho@@ oting Gir@@ l@@ friend
In a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
Lam@@ b made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably up@@ set , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
In@@ side the home , officers found A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand-@@ written note scri@@ bb@@ led on a white legal p@@ ad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
There was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school &apos;s camp@@ us , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ ynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m .
He said Lam@@ b made the f@@ ateful 9@@ 11 call some@@ time after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and fac@@ ul@@ ty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
The details released by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a tal@@ ented but possibly troub@@ led teacher .
Stu@@ dents said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmi@@ dt himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 fac@@ ul@@ ty members , and many students took courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
A student who pra@@ ised Lam@@ b , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ tery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
Another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14-@@ 15 academic year .
Lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only teaching two online classes .
Rec@@ ent changes in the university &apos;s hi@@ ring policies meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic ten@@ ure track to become an assi@@ stant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
Those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After fle@@ eing the camp@@ us , police later picked up Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he cro@@ ssed back into Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
Before he could be ap@@ prehen@@ ded , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 3@@ 8-@@ cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Green@@ ville , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el John@@ son .
His car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though John@@ son said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught geograph@@ y and education classes .
He received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
One of Lam@@ b &apos;s long@@ time friends described him as smart , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun@@ ny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
He was quite the hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b back then .
All the girls would melt when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson sub@@ ur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
In the 9@@ 11 call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
They had a dog named Ligh@@ tn@@ ing that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; ex-@@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; She was completely dev@@ ast@@ ated , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played together in the occa@@ sional gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss the night of S@@ ept . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
There was no sign of anything am@@ is@@ s .
&quot; Just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
We were cutting up and thro@@ wing one-@@ lin@@ ers at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wi@@ t about them .
Schmi@@ dt , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first-@@ year seminar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three young children .
He studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and student government .
On the Delta State camp@@ us in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including fac@@ ul@@ ty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ le@@ light mem@@ orial .
Schmi@@ dt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother Je@@ ff Schmi@@ dt also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , during which the university cho@@ ir s@@ ang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Gra@@ ce . &quot;
Cl@@ asses resume Wednesday .
&quot; We &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ ge@@ lio Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
Associ@@ ated Press writers E@@ mi@@ ly Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , and Re@@ be@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Or@@ le@@ ans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmi@@ dt , and that while Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

It was note@@ worthy because of personal reasons , too .
&quot; We were sitting in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it da@@ wns on me that Princ@@ ess Di@@ ana is going to be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a tra@@ iler for an upcoming documentary , &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN Chief Sa@@ ys There Is No Military Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary-General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s step@@ ped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five-@@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
The U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sid@@ el@@ ines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministeri@@ al session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syri@@ an people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l Num@@ bers That Show Donald Tru@@ mp Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ pper .
Others have dis@@ missed him as a jo@@ ke .
And some are holding out for an imp@@ lo@@ sion .
But no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to drag Donald Tru@@ mp down from at@@ op the p@@ olls , it has@@ n &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national p@@ olls have shown Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nom@@ ination chances .
Of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
None of this is to say that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
Pun@@ di@@ ts point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nom@@ ination process .
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogn@@ izing Tru@@ mp &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
Here are some recent pol@@ l numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
Tru@@ mp &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University pol@@ l showed only two in 10 Republi@@ cans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
By mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republi@@ cans have a favor@@ able view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
Rou@@ ghly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Qu@@ inn@@ i@@ pi@@ ac pol@@ l in I@@ o@@ wa last week found that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans there had a favor@@ able view of Tru@@ mp .
T@@ wo@@ -@@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as the nom@@ ine@@ e .
In a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp were the nom@@ ine@@ e .
Only two in 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set &quot; if he were the nom@@ ine@@ e .
Only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent who say the same of Tru@@ mp ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rub@@ io with only 21 percent .
On the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; up@@ set &quot; if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nom@@ ine@@ e .
A majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp &apos;s tem@@ per@@ ament as a problem .
While Donald Tru@@ mp has been widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of le@@ an@@ ed Republi@@ can voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s AB@@ C News / Washington Post pol@@ l .
The same number holds in the first-@@ in-@@ the-@@ nation cau@@ cus state of I@@ o@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think he has the personality to be comm@@ ander in chief , according to Qu@@ inn@@ i@@ pi@@ ac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his tem@@ per@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to AB@@ C / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pun@@ dit h@@ ats , Republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nom@@ ination , four in 10 said Tru@@ mp was the best bet , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l out last week .
That &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
Full dis@@ closure : G@@ O@@ P voters haven &apos;t had the cle@@ arest crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four in 10 Republi@@ cans picked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nom@@ ination , v@@ s. only 28 percent for event@@ ual nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Still , it shows that a plurali@@ ty of G@@ O@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
Even if Republi@@ cans r@@ al@@ lied around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still be@@ ats almost everyone .
Some pun@@ di@@ ts point out that the sp@@ lin@@ tered field is likely contributing to Tru@@ mp &apos;s lead , while anti-@@ Tru@@ mp support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a do@@ zen other candidates .
But a Mon@@ mouth University pol@@ l in early September shows that , in a hy@@ pothe@@ tical head@@ -@@ to-@@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
He leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Rub@@ io by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
He &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cruz .
The only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man by a wide 19 points in a hy@@ pothe@@ tical head@@ -@@ to-@@ head .
A bare majority of Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
A new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T pol@@ l out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have locked in their votes .
Obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
Still , Tru@@ mp &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Tru@@ mp .
Six in 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
Even since Donald Tru@@ mp called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 20@@ 16 conversation .
Some are worried that Tru@@ mp &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial His@@ pan@@ ic voters away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
But according to Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post pol@@ l , six in 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it seems Donald Tru@@ mp will remain too .
Fru@@ stration with government is climbing to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republi@@ can voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
Six in 10 Republi@@ cans in Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post pol@@ l say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
And they are an@@ gr@@ y at Washington , too .
A Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg pol@@ l in I@@ o@@ wa from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ o@@ wa Republi@@ cans are fru@@ str@@ ated with Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in Ho@@ boo@@ ken@@ weg – with a view over the North Sea mu@@ d@@ flat@@ s .
On this road one square met@@ re of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
&quot; On Sy@@ lt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , &quot; says a study – hence the high prices .
This new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square met@@ re .
Of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square met@@ re for student di@@ gs in Munich is not really low .
Comp@@ ared with Germany &apos;s top areas , however , this price seems likes pe@@ an@@ uts .
Property service En@@ gel &amp; Vol@@ kers has published a le@@ ague table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square met@@ re .
More than € 10,000 is nothing there - per quare met@@ re , mind you .
O@@ k , if you can &apos;t afford it ...

A confident start to the Champ@@ ions League season .
World champ@@ ions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e brought about a dream start to their &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the see@@ thing cau@@ l@@ dr@@ on at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won their opening match in the Champ@@ ions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller &apos;s bra@@ ce ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ e &apos;s goal ( 8@@ 9th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The t@@ wel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 20@@ 16 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trop@@ h@@ y back to Munich .
With his 28@@ th goal in the Champ@@ ions League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gra@@ cious help of O@@ ly@@ mi@@ ac@@ os go@@ ali@@ e Rober@@ to , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
&quot; We aren &apos;t going to under@@ estimate them , &quot; promised Bayern cap@@ tain Phil@@ li@@ pp L@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
They demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us had won their six most recent premi@@ ere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ le@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
In 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund st@@ umb@@ led here too .
But Bayern , un@@ defe@@ ated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went to work bol@@ dly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
Att@@ acks were too often initiated by bringing left w@@ inger Dou@@ glas Costa , who rarely got past former Brun@@ swi@@ ck player O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field dro@@ ve into the top left corner of the goal .
In the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ o@@ wski had the best opportunities in the first half .
First when Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the P@@ ole &apos;s he@@ ader from the line in the 26@@ th minute .
Then with a shot which the go@@ ali@@ e par@@ ried with his kne@@ e in the 35@@ th minute .
Although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us were able to need@@ le them .
But they could count on go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er .
For example when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 5@@ 6th minute .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four-@@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , back in the squ@@ ad following mus@@ cle problems , initially sat on the sid@@ el@@ ines .
The world cup her@@ o had only been given the green light following final training , said S@@ porting Director Matthias Sam@@ mer on Sky : &quot; If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being mali@@ cious &quot; .
At the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the stri@@ cken Le@@ wand@@ o@@ wski in the 5@@ 9th minute .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal in the 7@@ 6th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
Before the match there was a ri@@ ot in the stadium .
After a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing mas@@ ks , had apparently provo@@ ked supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us from behind their f@@ ence with words and gest@@ ures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
At least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
S@@ mo@@ kers at a greater risk of losing teeth
S@@ mo@@ kers damage not only their l@@ ungs but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Pots@@ dam .
The good news is : if you give up the risk decre@@ ases fast .
S@@ mo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This emer@@ ges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for N@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Pots@@ dam .
Comp@@ ared to non-@@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely is between 2.5 and 3.@@ 6 times higher for smo@@ kers .
The scientists monitored more than 23@@ ,@@ 300 participants .
The main reasons for to@@ oth loss are c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
S@@ moking is a risk factor for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , emphasise the authors .
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent g@@ um infl@@ amm@@ ation in smo@@ kers .
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of c@@ aries .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research &quot; .
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drop@@ s to the level of non-@@ smo@@ kers &apos; , declared lead author Thomas Di@@ et@@ rich of the University of Birmingham in England .
People should be persu@@ aded to become non-@@ smo@@ kers , declared study leader H@@ einer Bo@@ eing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; S@@ moking shor@@ tens the li@@ fes@@ p@@ an &quot; .
Not smoking is good for the l@@ ungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by to@@ o@@ th@@ less@@ ness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
Ear@@ lier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early to@@ oth loss .
The new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
Arch@@ ae@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists from the Roman German@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Bou@@ levard is being constructed , said museum Director Mar@@ cus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
Hist@@ ori@@ ans have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
The museum , as the department for archaeological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
The archae@@ ologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rh@@ ein Bou@@ levard .
It is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a c@@ eme@@ tery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belon@@ ged to the church , has also been discovered .
Young woman hit by goods train
After a young woman met with an accident at the station in Gei@@ len@@ kir@@ chen@@ -@@ Lin@@ dern , police are asking for help from the general public .
Early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman cro@@ ssed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
According to the Federal police she suffered severe inj@@ uries from the accident .
She was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by amb@@ ul@@ ance .
Investi@@ g@@ ating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
It is possible that the event was observed by witn@@ esses or residents may have heard something .
This may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lin@@ dern station , Zie@@ gel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Th@@ om@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
Any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police hot@@ line on 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88 8@@ 000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in contro@@ vers@@ y over TT@@ IP
To def@@ use the contro@@ vers@@ y over the planned Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
According to this , the disp@@ uted private arbit@@ ration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
&quot; We want to set up a system which citizens trust , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner , C@@ ec@@ ilia Mal@@ ström , when introducing it .
The Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German government has announced its support .
The creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
Plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come in equal propor@@ tions from the EU , the USA and from non-@@ member countries .
For the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
This would allow for appe@@ als to be made against jud@@ gements .
Up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitr@@ ator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , comm@@ ented Mal@@ ström .
In the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
In this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cle@@ ared up .
Invest@@ or State Dis@@ p@@ ute Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the sti@@ ff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
Tradi@@ tional arbit@@ ration courts are criticised by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax pa@@ yers , make national laws n@@ ull and void , or enforce a lower@@ ing of consumer and environmental protection standards .
In initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organisations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission &apos;s proposals inadequate .
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
The German Secretary of State for the Economy , Matthias Mach@@ ni@@ g ( SP@@ D ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Econom@@ ics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el developed with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ ström &apos;s plans .
The European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ cting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
When talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
Ne@@ goti@@ ations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
It was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
This date is no longer ten@@ able .
Ex@@ qui@@ site folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens in Hamburg
Ele@@ ven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens si@@ ts on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in Cologne .
Be@@ side him stands a fli@@ p chart on which the sh@@ y-@@ seem@@ ing folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an in fel@@ t-@@ tip pen .
The entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by Ste@@ vens &apos;s performance .
Refer@@ ring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his me@@ ticul@@ ously and sub@@ tly contri@@ ved songs .
Where they origin@@ ated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
Since then Ste@@ vens has proved himself to be a wonder@@ fully creative nut@@ case .
His third album , &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; , released in 2003 , features cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might dri@@ ft at any time into amazing op@@ ul@@ ence .
Rum@@ our has it that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
But in 2004 in the Rhine area , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; came out , bur@@ sting positive expectations .
Ste@@ vens seems to have down@@ sized here .
Pla@@ ying live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
One year later the New Yor@@ k-@@ based musi@@ cian returns to his series .
With &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens Inv@@ ites You To : Come On Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ ise &quot; ) in 2005 , a widely acc@@ laimed master@@ piece is released .
Ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic sophistic@@ ation .
The album clim@@ bs the American B@@ ill@@ board charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
After extremely productive experiments Ste@@ vens then serves up &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , an elabor@@ ate electronic set piece .
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchest@@ rated , but supported by program@@ med sequ@@ ences or be@@ ats and plays with a variety of effects and echo@@ es .
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent stage decor@@ ations .
Currently Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens is tour@@ ing Germany as part of a five-@@ man band .
Hamburg Mehr kept in the dark !
Since March the theatre has primarily presented &quot; Car@@ ri@@ e and Lo@@ well &quot; .
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Ste@@ vens returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
Without direc@@ ting a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enrich@@ ed album .
From the audience one can hear : the performance is more &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and it makes you want to &quot; ch@@ u@@ ck away the album &quot; .
Only with his en@@ core does Ste@@ vens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs acou@@ stically and finally take a bow to th@@ under@@ ous ap@@ plause .
Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s de@@ but at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awa@@ ited
New Labour leader Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions later , taking on David Cam@@ eron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ lot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrut@@ in@@ ised by the media and Labour MP@@ s .
He has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
He has also said he could ski@@ p some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cab@@ inet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MP@@ s and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
A spo@@ kes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respec@@ tful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &quot;
But a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ arch@@ y should be abolished .
N@@ early a do@@ zen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , c@@ iting differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspon@@ dent Rob@@ in Bran@@ t says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ acking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
H@@ ours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secre@@ tary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cam@@ eron has faced across the des@@ patch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd s@@ our@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cam@@ eron and has been given more than 30@@ ,000 suggestions .
The Is@@ ling@@ ton North M@@ P has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; repar@@ tee &quot; and trading bar@@ bs , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secre@@ tary , will de@@ pu@@ tise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cam@@ eron is travelling abroad .
He has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had appro@@ ached the Commons Spe@@ aker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cam@@ eron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; Pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
Since it was first tel@@ ev@@ ised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ometer of a leader &apos;s jud@@ gement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MP@@ s although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far-reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
The po@@ und j@@ ump@@ ed following data showing a pi@@ ck-@@ up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ B@@ Mil@@ ler .
Between May and July , UK earnings excluding bon@@ uses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
The rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
Ster@@ ling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 .
The FT@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Mil@@ ler was the stand@@ -@@ out stock on the market , j@@ umping 20 % after it received a bid approach from ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
A deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ wei@@ ser , Stell@@ a Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from ri@@ val luxury goods group Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
Sha@@ res in G@@ len@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share placement as part of its deb@@ t-@@ cutting strategy .
Sha@@ res in packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.@@ 3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the spor@@ ts@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jump in half-@@ year pre-@@ tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m .
J@@ D Sports bo@@ ss says higher wages could hur@@ t expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the po@@ ckets of potential consumers . &quot;
But that spending power is unlikely to out@@ wei@@ gh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
The costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber in the capital city : on a B@@ ie@@ ber ex@@ pedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber , me@@ gast@@ ar .
A ridicul@@ ous 21 years young , a wi@@ mp@@ y k@@ id with a too trendy hair@@ cut .
The guy with the plat@@ in@@ um bl@@ ond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
Pro@@ b@@ ably even more .
At the moment Mon@@ sie@@ ur B@@ ie@@ ber is in Berlin .
And the under-@@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
Like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
The 15-@@ year-old has never heard the name Rit@@ z Carl@@ ton .
Not so bad .
H@@ und@@ reds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
Inclu@@ ding E@@ va and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
But the Pol@@ es have been sitting on the cold stone sla@@ b in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Pots@@ damer Platz since 7 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning .
The B@@ ie@@ ber building : their i@@ do@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of post@@ ers in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in six months .
At least .
She says : &quot; My Vi@@ kt@@ oria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the gram@@ mar school at the moment . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fulfilling her dream for her . &quot;
Comp@@ ulsory education ?
Who wants that ?
Not the fans .
Nor B@@ ie@@ ber himself .
He is financially secure anyway .
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bow@@ l , a two-@@ year deal with an anti-@@ spot company p@@ ours many many dollars into B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s account .
And for every dol@@ l that looks like him and passes over the counter B@@ ie@@ ber cas@@ hes in as well .
When Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber drinks coffee people go@@ ggle through the window .
He has lo@@ oted more than a hundred million like that .
Some say the h@@ ype goes too far .
Others point out that after all B@@ ie@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number one .
B@@ ie@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
At least that &apos;s what he says .
Pe@@ gi@@ da po@@ ster suggests the idea of pot@@ ato don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s to Leban@@ ese man
Pot@@ ato@@ es or don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab ?
You can have both – in the pot@@ ato k@@ eb@@ ab that Ol@@ den@@ burg snack bar owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has created .
Inspi@@ red by the s@@ logan &quot; pot@@ ato@@ es instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement po@@ ster , Al@@ ha@@ y put pot@@ ato@@ es and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
A po@@ ster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the s@@ logan &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ es instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
Since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and pot@@ ato@@ es has been rot@@ ating in his shop .
&quot; That is multi-@@ cultural food ! &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
Now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
Because of this , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how many pot@@ ato@@ es the sp@@ it holds .
Just enough so that , &quot; They taste much better together , &quot; he reck@@ ons .
Customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
Met@@ cash laun@@ ches gra@@ ss@@ roots campaign to fight Al@@ di inc@@ ur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di ons@@ lau@@ ght in South Australia and Western Australia .
Gro@@ cer@@ y wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has ki@@ cked off a gra@@ ss@@ roots campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
As Al@@ di pre@@ pa@@ res to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A brand through main@@ stream and social media marketing and events such as the Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
IG@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers and suppliers are j@@ umping on board , with brands such as Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ -based ice cream maker S@@ imm@@ o &apos;s offering taste testing at IG@@ A stores and store owners selling dis@@ counted South Australian football le@@ ague tickets to lo@@ yal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , li@@ qu@@ or and hardware wholes@@ aler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
There is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A store foot@@ print and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian shop@@ pers are not@@ ori@@ ously par@@ o@@ chi@@ al and IG@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in W@@ A compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
However , an@@ alyst@@ s such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent re@@ tail@@ ers .
In a report this week , Morgan Stan@@ ley analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath estimated that IG@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in W@@ A next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and volumes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fix@@ ed-@@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
At the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Ro@@ y Morgan survey found IG@@ A shop@@ pers were most lo@@ yal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
Last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Mel@@ bour@@ ne that Met@@ cash could &quot; highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has dec@@ lined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos; comments .
But it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member cont@@ acted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1200 IG@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating dele@@ verage as sales and mar@@ gins come under pressure .
However , the wholes@@ aler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shel@@ f prices at Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping IG@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers refurb@@ ish stores by adding fast@@ er-@@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label gro@@ c@@ eries .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refurb@@ ishment programs are gaining tra@@ ction and is hoping the wholes@@ aler will return to underlying profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ al@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been the col@@ lateral damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ al@@ y .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the tal@@ ented du@@ o regularly referred to as the &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was dra@@ gged into an un@@ welcome spot@@ light by the in@@ famous Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os sle@@ dge of St@@ an Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Ma@@ sters .
In a fi@@ ery quali@@ fying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his oppon@@ ent Ry@@ an Har@@ ris@@ on twice had to be separated by the chair ump@@ ire , with Har@@ ris@@ on declar@@ ing : &quot; Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka should &apos;ve deck@@ ed Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os , and I should deck that k@@ id . &quot;
While he was last seen sm@@ ash@@ ing a rac@@ quet after cra@@ mp fo@@ iled a potential US Open up@@ set of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been defended staun@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ al@@ y .
The teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with S@@ am Gro@@ th for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bern@@ ard Tom@@ ic in the Dav@@ is Cup semi-@@ final against Britain .
&quot; One thing I do feel quite ke@@ en@@ ly about is I think Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s been dra@@ gged into the fra@@ y a little bit , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
He did break a rac@@ quet when he lost when he cra@@ mp@@ ed in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a rac@@ quet out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he w@@ ouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
But , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
He &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
He &apos;s a very mature 19@@ -@@ year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he has@@ n &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the lo@@ cker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to over@@ look Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , descri@@ bing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long-term fix@@ ture in the team .
&quot; First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
And I think N@@ ick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ me@@ light where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe m@@ igrant crisis : Hungary decla@@ res emergency , se@@ als border , deta@@ ins migrants
Declar@@ ing a state of emergency , Hungary se@@ aled off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and de@@ tained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants p@@ ouring in .
Chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants p@@ iled up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
Stu@@ ck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; check@@ points , those fle@@ eing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched t@@ ents and settled in .
But fru@@ strations were on the rise .
As a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ ver@@ ed above , migrants chan@@ ted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ ou@@ ted insul@@ ts at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
Some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not col@@ lateral damage .
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
The tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hung@@ ari@@ an-@@ Serbian border came a day after the 28@@ -@@ nation blo@@ c failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people seeking refuge in overwhel@@ med Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an event@@ ual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120@@ ,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighb@@ ors .
Tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
Meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a ra@@ z@@ or-@@ wire f@@ ence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a f@@ ence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Char@@ lie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ m@@ ates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the ra@@ z@@ or wire f@@ ence between Hungary and Serbia .
In the last few months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Vi@@ ktor Or@@ ban , however , has insi@@ sted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view shar@@ ply at od@@ ds with other EU nations , including Germany .
The new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-@@ meter ( 13@@ -@@ foot ) ra@@ z@@ or-@@ wire f@@ ence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convi@@ cted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; Due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government decla@@ res a state of crisis , &quot; government spo@@ kes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
We are very clear on this : Il@@ legal border crossing is a crime .
Techn@@ ically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ por@@ ters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , hom@@ eland security adv@@ iser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
They got across by damaging the f@@ ence , are now in police cu@@ sto@@ dy and are being charged with commit@@ ting off@@ enses under the new laws .
Auth@@ orities are quickly repa@@ iring the f@@ ence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deplo@@ ying a train car covered with ra@@ z@@ or wire to close one of them .
Chaos en@@ velop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ro@@ sz@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crow@@ ds pressed to squ@@ ee@@ ze inside .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were ref@@ using food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
Ele@@ ction 20@@ 16 : H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders cut by half in national pol@@ l
For@@ mer Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double-@@ dig@@ it lead in the Democratic race for the nom@@ ination nation@@ ally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while S@@ anders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Jo@@ e Bi@@ den , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
More than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
But Clinton &apos;s back@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
Since last month &apos;s C@@ BS News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have narro@@ wed .
Her support among men has dropped considerably and S@@ anders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and she and S@@ anders are now even .
However , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders by double-@@ dig@@ its among liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5-@@ point edge with this group .
About half of Democratic primary voters nation@@ wide say they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nom@@ ine@@ e .
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nom@@ ine@@ e .
Six percent would not support her .
Perhaps not surpris@@ ingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
Vie@@ ws are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support her .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusias@@ tically back Clinton , fewer Republi@@ can voters say that about their fron@@ trun@@ ner , Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open-@@ ended question why they want her to be the nom@@ ine@@ e , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also c@@ ited .
As the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nom@@ ination , Bi@@ den is the top pick .
Among Clinton supporters , more than half say Bi@@ den would be their second choice , far ahead of S@@ anders .
If Bi@@ den choo@@ ses not to run for the Democratic nom@@ ination , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead over S@@ anders wi@@ dens , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
Fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
Still , when asked which is more important in a nom@@ ine@@ e , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
Simil@@ ar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nom@@ ine@@ e to these primary voters .
The Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
Maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den does the best of the three on honest@@ y , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
Thir@@ ty percent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as in line with their views ide@@ ologically .
On all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
As questions continue about H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has@@ n &apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
But it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
Hal@@ f of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
The public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
Most Americans say the email contro@@ vers@@ y has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
It is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
Six@@ ty-@@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy .
At the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nation@@ wide don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy either .
Both Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , get good marks on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honest@@ y .
More see S@@ anders as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in national pol@@ l
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the newest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new pol@@ l , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ ung@@ ing for a foo@@ th@@ old
Republi@@ can voters nation@@ wide continue to back Tru@@ mp in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the pol@@ l out Tuesday .
But Car@@ son ro@@ ck@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
The survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out Tru@@ mp among colle@@ ge-@@ educated Republi@@ can voters .
The rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o Go@@ v. John Ka@@ sich , has sli@@ pped behind with Wis@@ consi@@ n Go@@ v. Scott Wal@@ ker falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
For@@ mer Florida Go@@ v. Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Go@@ v. Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ . Marco Rub@@ io all tied for third place with 6 % .
The margin of error for the 3@@ 7@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republi@@ can voters in this newest pol@@ l is pl@@ us-@@ or-@@ min@@ us 6 % , and was conducted S@@ ept .
The latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the p@@ olls -- landing at 19 % support among Republi@@ cans , behind Tru@@ mp &apos;s 32 % support .
The latest pol@@ l from AB@@ C News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
Fac@@ ing a rising Car@@ son last week , Tru@@ mp took some pot@@ shots at the reti@@ red neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for ques@@ tioning Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; We need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ o@@ wa .
Ple@@ as@@ ant temperatures for bathing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
Even if peak levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water .
A di@@ p in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German me@@ te@@ or@@ ological office ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
The Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for bathing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic peak temperatures are 25 degrees , and in France 23 degrees .

Five fr@@ at@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ u@@ ch College fresh@@ man
N@@ early two years after a college student died during a fr@@ at@@ ernity ha@@ zing ri@@ tual in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
Members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ u@@ ch College P@@ i Delta P@@ si fr@@ at@@ ernity brut@@ ally ass@@ aul@@ ted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initi@@ ation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
Off@@ ici@@ als said he was blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , s@@ add@@ led with a 30-@@ po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined that his head hur@@ t then fell un@@ conscious .
P@@ i Delta P@@ si fr@@ at@@ ernity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Den@@ g passed out , and alle@@ ge@@ dly wa@@ ited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
They did , however , find time to change Den@@ g &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact An@@ dy Men@@ g , the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wag@@ ner said at a news conference .
&quot; At this point , members began to hide par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and basically put the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s well-being over that of Michael Den@@ g &apos;s , &quot; Chief Wag@@ ner said .
He could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning .
According to an au@@ top@@ sy report , Den@@ g was subjected to repeated bl@@ unt force trau@@ ma to his head , tor@@ so , and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; Too many families have been dev@@ ast@@ ated as a result of fr@@ at@@ ernity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , &quot; Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Den@@ g &apos;s family , said in a statement .
F@@ rat@@ ern@@ ities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
A Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third-@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Thir@@ ty-@@ two other fr@@ at@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with ass@@ ault ha@@ zing and criminal con@@ spi@@ racy .
&quot; We want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanc@@ tioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; Wag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ u@@ ch College banned the fr@@ at@@ ernity and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity re@@ vo@@ ked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
Here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hi@@ ke will come and the bul@@ l market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond yiel@@ ds will climb and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
This we know .
What we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
For the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hi@@ ke and as long as 86 months .
The Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That &apos;s why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigor@@ ously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the tra@@ jec@@ tory of how long it will take to normali@@ ze .
There are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
In the end , however , market participants may find that all the rat@@ e-@@ hi@@ ke f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
&quot; The first hi@@ ke from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Ju@@ lian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief global econom@@ ist at Capital Econom@@ ics , said in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that many seem to fear .
That &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
Here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
As the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip@@ ation of rate hi@@ kes can make things vol@@ atile for a while .
Once the hi@@ ke h@@ its , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to st@@ all 12-@@ 24 months after the first hi@@ ke , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank an@@ alyst@@ s said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hi@@ kes .
More specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up shar@@ ply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hi@@ ke , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.@@ 6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bo@@ b Dol@@ l , chief equity strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , posted on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pron@@ ounced later in the rat@@ e-@@ hiking cycle and returns begin to dimin@@ ish .
Rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hi@@ kes often help them along .
In the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ sten a recession .
Most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hi@@ ke .
According to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hi@@ kes since 1950 , only twice has nom@@ inal year over year GDP been below 4.@@ 5 percent .
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlan@@ ta Fed .
Hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
Market participants have been bra@@ cing for a Fed hi@@ ke all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
While many strategi@@ sts and economists believe the F@@ OM@@ C could approve a hi@@ ke at this meeting , fut@@ ures trading indicates just a 25 percent prob@@ ability .
&quot; In our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing le@@ verage with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing pr@@ er@@ ec@@ ession peaks very quickly post the recovery comm@@ encing , &quot; the report said .
By contrast this has been a uniqu@@ ely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has wa@@ ited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
Fi@@ xed income also has been vol@@ atile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hi@@ ke , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equi@@ ties experience .
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
For bonds , it does seem yiel@@ ds change direction immediately as the first hi@@ ke / cut in the cycle arri@@ ves .
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yiel@@ ds fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b strategi@@ sts believe the hi@@ ke in rates will cause yiel@@ ds between lon@@ ger@@ - and shor@@ ter-@@ dated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ tening the cur@@ ve .
High-@@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cau@@ tious about stret@@ ching for yield , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of ti@@ ghter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
Shor@@ t-@@ term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is f@@ latter , credit sp@@ reads have wi@@ dened and vol@@ atility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
Bro@@ adly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; History shows that &apos; quality &apos; stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hi@@ ke , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ alyst@@ s said in a report for clients .
Fir@@ ms with strong balance sheets out@@ pac@@ ed weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hi@@ kes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low vol@@ atility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counter@@ parts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
Deb@@ t will become a big issue .
Companies with a high percentage of flo@@ ating rate debt stand to lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
Out@@ side pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
Sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yiel@@ ds at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic F@@ M says M@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham
Con@@ servative M@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham criticised station for &apos; du@@ mb@@ ing down@@ &apos;
Ar@@ gues it &apos;s becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from commercial ri@@ val
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Bri@@ ts
Colle@@ ague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins M@@ P attacked The Vo@@ ice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; Classic F@@ M , a leading M@@ P has claimed , p@@ iling fresh pressure on the broad@@ cast@@ er to prove that it does something that commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
Con@@ servative M@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC bo@@ sses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from its commercial ri@@ val .
&quot; Radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Classic F@@ M , &quot; he said .
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Bri@@ ts by another name .
So , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just m@@ im@@ i@@ cking what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ val when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
And it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; And also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commission@@ ing new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
Ear@@ lier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audi@@ ences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the to@@ es of commercial ri@@ vals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory M@@ P Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Vo@@ ice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Bo@@ y George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly BBC way . &quot;
He added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in-house stable &quot; next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or spending licence fee pa@@ yers &apos; money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bol@@ stered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Exper@@ ts believe November &apos;s Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into gh@@ o@@ st towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are le@@ vel@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
Exper@@ ts say there are signs that online sales are le@@ vel@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , &apos; An@@ dy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
He explained that online sales were bol@@ stered three years ago when shop@@ pers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contex@@ ts , such as on the sofa .
But now that is pl@@ ate@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
The Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being c@@ ited as one of the reasons behind the s@@ lowing sales .
Exper@@ ts believe shop@@ pers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shop@@ pers flo@@ cked to their computers to sn@@ ap up deals cra@@ shing a number of re@@ tail@@ ers websites .
Exper@@ ts believe Black Friday , which saw shop@@ pers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding shop@@ pers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
For some products , such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mec@@ ca c@@ ran@@ e crash as B@@ in Laden family sanc@@ tioned
Bo@@ dies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first fun@@ er@@ als take place in Mec@@ ca

The Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 94 people were also injured after the c@@ ran@@ e cra@@ shed down
Car@@ ried alo@@ ft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a c@@ ran@@ e collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand mos@@ que .
Dres@@ sed largely in white , m@@ ourn@@ ers packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ a@@ iss@@ em c@@ eme@@ tery .
The sad possession passed by the hol@@ y site , where just days earlier a construction c@@ ran@@ e cra@@ shed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and top@@ pled onto wor@@ shi@@ pers .
The bodies were released for fun@@ er@@ al as the Saudi King sanc@@ tioned the B@@ in Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .

Mr A@@ kra@@ m had been in the Grand Mo@@ s@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j pilgri@@ ma@@ ge .
Saudi officials have already vo@@ wed that the ha@@ j@@ j to Mec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
Today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin@@ la@@ din Group should not have left the c@@ ran@@ e &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
An Arab@@ ic version of the decre@@ e , carried by the state-@@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ la@@ din Group was partly to blame for the collapse .

B &amp; Q bo@@ ss says Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Brit@@ ons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
Num@@ ber of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
Resul@@ ting in 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , opening
At same time King@@ fis@@ her is closing 60 B &amp; Q out@@ lets across the country
By Ru@@ per@@ t St@@ einer , Chief City Cor@@ respon@@ dent for the Da@@ ily Mail
Brit@@ ons are said to be putting down their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ br@@ us@@ hes in favour of emplo@@ ying skilled Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men to carry out work in their home
If you are handy with a ham@@ mer or a whi@@ z@@ z at painting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
Because Brit@@ ons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the bo@@ ss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry , new chief executive of King@@ fis@@ her , which own@@ s the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at ro@@ ck-@@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
As a result , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q out@@ lets .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
Currently the majority of staff are men .
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
We need to move more towards a balance .
Fundament@@ ally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
Women play a big part in the decision-making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the hel@@ m of Britain &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restruc@@ tured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staff@@ ed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
King@@ fis@@ her posted a fall in both half-@@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ utting stores .
As a result of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , which own@@ s Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
Off@@ ici@@ als from A@@ ich@@ -@@ Do@@ b in court for breach of trust
Two officials from the Austrian vol@@ leyball run@@ n@@ er-@@ up champion team A@@ ich@@ -@@ Do@@ b attended the Kla@@ gen@@ fur@@ t regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax ev@@ asion .
The defen@@ dants ple@@ aded not guilty .
One of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
He was legally acqu@@ it@@ ted of this charge in May .
The current case was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
According to senior Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defen@@ dants used mon@@ ies from the club &apos;s accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
The loss is estimated at around € 400@@ ,000 .
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences .
The Chair@@ woman of the La@@ y Ju@@ dge Sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed .
It will be tried at a later date .
On the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disadvantage
The sports officials had only offset expense allow@@ ances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - li@@ abilities in 2001 amoun@@ ted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( around € 4@@ 4@@ ,000 ) .
&quot; At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ents , who makes his living as an audi@@ tor of large companies for the tax authorities .
With his colleague and co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
With all the risks .
&quot; We advanced money and deposi@@ ted our life insurance policies with the bank as security , &quot; he said during the examination .
It was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
Furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spective payment of the expense allow@@ ance back to 1991 was agreed .
As a result , a part of the expense allow@@ ance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
This is why general and not detailed deb@@ it entries appeared , was the former chairman &apos;s explanation for the processes .
The two defen@@ dants managed the accounts and pass@@ books together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
The Ju@@ dge asked why the payments had not been dis@@ closed to the club in detail .
The club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
When investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred into the club &apos;s account .
Those were reserves , explained the def@@ end@@ ant .
This securities account was run in the name of the two defen@@ dants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
&quot; Why ? &quot; the Ju@@ dge wanted to know .
There was no answer to this for a long time .
Then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
H@@ ad something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Pro@@ sec@@ utor put to the room .
The co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant knew about it , the official justified himself .
The purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
&quot; Why compensation for damages ? &quot; the Ju@@ dge and the State Pro@@ sec@@ utor wanted to know .
In response , the first def@@ end@@ ant said that he had dis@@ agreed with this wording because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
But what can I do when the lawyer says , &quot; This lets us all off the ho@@ ok &quot; ?
&quot; Am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in sal@@ ary , he had only charged for mile@@ age and a per di@@ em allow@@ ance .
The club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ em allow@@ ances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
The defen@@ dants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years .
This was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
The second def@@ end@@ ant had also obtained a mile@@ age allow@@ ance .
All adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in Völker@@ markt to the bank in Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
The trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witn@@ esses .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard cutting a further 30@@ ,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the sp@@ lit@@ ting of the company .
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant He@@ wle@@ tt@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
As part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25@@ ,000 and 30@@ ,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
This should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company dis@@ closed on Tuesday .
The step will lead to a one-@@ off charge of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
At the end of the 2013 / 14 business year HP still employed around 30@@ 2@@ ,000 staff .
At the end of trading He@@ wle@@ tt@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard shares had fallen by 2.@@ 3 percent .
The group based in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , California , which initially grew through its printer sales , is currently sp@@ lit@@ ting its business : this year the computer and printer side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
Both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
Re@@ pe@@ at@@ edly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently aff@@ lic@@ ted the world &apos;s second-@@ largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ ovo .
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and pr@@ inters fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
Re@@ venue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 2@@ 5.@@ 4 billion .
This means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive lay@@ off@@ s .
The 7@@ 6-@@ year-old business headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying sm@@ art@@ phones and tab@@ lets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s plans for restructuring include around 5@@ 5,000 job losses .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts : the majority support anti IS@@ IS training mission
The majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
Six@@ ty-@@ one percent re@@ acted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against IS@@ IS in Iraq and Syria .
T@@ w@@ enty-@@ four percent are against interven@@ ing in the conflict .
Fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ one percent of those surve@@ yed are against co@@ operating with the Syri@@ an rul@@ er B@@ ash@@ ar al-@@ As@@ sad , but 20 percent were in favour .
T@@ w@@ enty-@@ nine percent were un@@ decided .

The general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
The organis@@ ers from the automobile Association V@@ DA estimate that approximately 9@@ 00@@ ,000 visitors , similar to 2 years ago , will attend .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : out@@ break of violence on the Ser@@ bi@@ an-@@ Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used te@@ ar gas and water cann@@ ons against several hundred an@@ gr@@ y refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
He reported by telephone :
A group of refugees broke through the border .
A line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water cann@@ on stood at the ready .
Between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sti@@ cks and plastic bot@@ tles at the officers .
At first the officers used a continuous spra@@ y of pe@@ pper spra@@ y .
Then the police used te@@ ar gas .
A lot of te@@ ar gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
This caused the group to break up .
The group has now reluc@@ t@@ antly withdrawn .
A pregn@@ ant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
Children who have inhal@@ ed te@@ ar gas are scre@@ aming .
Other refugees have sl@@ ump@@ ed down together and are suffering from re@@ spir@@ atory dist@@ ress .
The press spo@@ kes@@ man for the Serbian police also sustained inj@@ uries from the use of te@@ ar gas and pe@@ pper spra@@ y .
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists poll@@ ed by Re@@ uters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
It &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normali@@ zation of interest rates , &quot; said An@@ gel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trilli@@ ons of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
However the Fed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy global outlook .
It has warned markets to be ready for a hi@@ ke but indications are they also believe the od@@ ds are against such a move .
The decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Delta State University sho@@ oter left note of ap@@ ology
After shooting and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed Tuesday .
Police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ . said Lam@@ b , a geograph@@ y and social science education instruc@@ tor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a.m .
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
Lam@@ b told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
He said &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to bo@@ ther anyone &quot; but is likely up@@ set .
Police asked the call@@ er his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
Lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
When police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : &quot; I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only person who ever loved me .
After writing the note , Lam@@ b dro@@ ve 300 miles to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cop@@ s closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
Despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b alle@@ ge@@ dly believed Pr@@ enti@@ ss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmi@@ dt , authorities said Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love tri@@ angle . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
The two di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; dev@@ ast@@ ated . &quot;
He said Pr@@ enti@@ ss and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ ald .
Kno@@ w@@ les said Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a ho@@ und dog named Ligh@@ tn@@ ing , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
&quot; She always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said .
Police said Lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point Monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to j@@ ail . &quot;
When cop@@ s caught up with him on High@@ way 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lam@@ b pul@@ led his car over , ba@@ iled out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
Lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ w@@ ings : Lufthansa re@@ construc@@ ting group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
The Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
Rec@@ on@@ struction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
Meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pi@@ lots &apos; union .
Lufthansa is re@@ organising the structure of its business and upgra@@ ding its low-@@ cost subsidiary Euro@@ w@@ ings .
The goal of the reali@@ gn@@ ment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
The Euro@@ w@@ ings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
In the future , Karl Ul@@ rich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ w@@ ings on the management board headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
With this new reali@@ gn@@ ment Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ w@@ ings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Eas@@ y@@ jet in the future .
Up to now the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been extremely complex .
The airline is consoli@@ dating the passenger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbrel@@ la .
New negotiations with pi@@ lots
Following the strike which was hal@@ ted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pi@@ lots &apos; union Cock@@ pit ( V@@ C ) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday .
This was announced by the union .
Under discussion will be the pi@@ lots &apos; retirement scheme .
&quot; In a year with record results predic@@ ted &quot; Cock@@ pit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
The conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
Besides the pi@@ lots &apos; transitional pension payments , the background is the &quot; W@@ ings &quot; budget concept .
It proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa outs@@ ources to the group &apos;s own budget airline , Euro@@ w@@ ings .

Manchester United &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double fra@@ c@@ ture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ c@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champ@@ ions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
While this left the full-@@ back in te@@ ars and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hop@@ e@@ ful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
The injury was caused by a reck@@ less tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20-@@ year-old Sha@@ w had bur@@ st into the PS@@ V area .
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pit@@ ch and required oxy@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
Van Ga@@ al said : &quot; He has a double leg fra@@ c@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
It is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fantas@@ tically and then this happens .
When it was in the dres@@ sing room he had an oxy@@ gen mask on .
He was cr@@ ying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fra@@ c@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ eno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the conc@@ ession of a spo@@ t-@@ k@@ ick .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ alise the Mexican .
Van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
It was a very bad tackle with two legs .
A t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; Thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;
Rel@@ ated : Manchester United suffer Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at PS@@ V
The England def@@ ender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phil@@ li@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; It &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
If any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an oppon@@ ent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the oppon@@ ent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .

PS@@ V &apos;s Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
Su@@ rely David Cam@@ eron knows The Lor@@ ax better than this ?
It &apos;s one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child lo@@ ves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless , it seems , you are David Cam@@ eron .
A@@ sk@@ ed by a provider of holiday child@@ care schemes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister op@@ ted for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
It was a difficult choice , Cam@@ eron writes in a message published on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , continuing : &quot; Fun@@ ny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
All very well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cam@@ eron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pré@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to p@@ ad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; Set in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 .
If that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough , Cam@@ eron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ ax film provided on the Internet Mo@@ vie Dat@@ ab@@ ase website , which begins : &quot; In the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y . &quot;
Given he is an avo@@ we@@ dly hand@@ s-@@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cam@@ eron is so un@@ familiar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy h@@ ears how the local environment was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the av@@ ari@@ cious , tre@@ e-@@ ch@@ opping , th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ k@@ nit@@ ting On@@ ce-@@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at , mou@@ st@@ ach@@ i@@ o@@ ed creature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
Most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been outs@@ our@@ ced to an ai@@ de , seem@@ ingly one who has never read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
A Down@@ ing Street spo@@ kes@@ woman said the text was believed to have come from Cam@@ eron &apos;s constituency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cam@@ eron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ is@@ sion but it &apos;s still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates is a tough assign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-@@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Ala@@ sta@@ ir C@@ ook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that bat@@ ting lin@@ eu@@ p and the collective min@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positi@@ vity .
With the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an att@@ acking option .
Rel@@ ated : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squ@@ ad and replaced by Ale@@ x H@@ ales
The decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yor@@ k@@ shire .
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cri@@ ck@@ eters are judged on output .
There were no question marks over Jo@@ e R@@ oot , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
A couple of half-@@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own dest@@ iny .
Hop@@ efully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire another opportunity will come along .
The England head coach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss , pra@@ ised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
The question of how long a Test b@@ ats@@ man gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven cap@@ s - like S@@ am Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton got nine .
Only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
The only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jon@@ athan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wa@@ sted opportunity is in the past now .
Ale@@ x H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man I rate highly .
He is an X-@@ factor cri@@ ck@@ eter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ shire saw early this season when he made 23@@ 6 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge pit@@ ch that was doing a bit .
He must at least be aff@@ orded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the ma@@ ke-@@ up of the side in the U@@ A@@ E .
The idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside C@@ ook , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four qui@@ cks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a stro@@ k@@ em@@ aker cannot bat there and this left-@@ han@@ der has already shown he is one hell of a cri@@ ck@@ eter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
My old te@@ am-@@ m@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 Tests at first drop before step@@ ping up to open in 2001 .
He pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back@@ -up sp@@ inner and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
People may look at his raw stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ inners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have op@@ ted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
A@@ way from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ aching staff .
The appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the Sri Lanka b@@ ats@@ man , as a consul@@ tant for the Test matches could be a master@@ stro@@ ke .
He is one of the game &apos;s lo@@ ve@@ liest blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ru@@ th@@ less stre@@ ak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cri@@ cket , be it playing or co@@ aching , and like Mah@@ ela has nous that can be ta@@ pped .
Sometimes new voices in the dres@@ sing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fresh@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham te@@ am-@@ m@@ ate Ben St@@ ok@@ es is re@@ sted for the one-@@ da@@ yers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
While not everyone will agree , the co@@ aches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
And you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
Such decisions are never taken ligh@@ tly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ dru@@ ms by 20@@ 17
David Cam@@ eron &apos;s half-@@ bak@@ ed rene@@ goti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jer@@ em@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
Fore@@ ign@@ ers have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages too .
A European diplom@@ at ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in assor@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self-@@ absor@@ bed agenda of divi@@ sive concessions and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
In Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they ero@@ ded social protection .
We could even call it Da@@ ve and George &apos;s sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
PM and chan@@ cell@@ or rock up to sum@@ mits or bilateral sessions in foreign capit@@ als , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It &apos;s all about me .
My European p@@ al , who wants an out@@ war@@ d-@@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short-@@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capit@@ als have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s cau@@ ti@@ ously le@@ vel-@@ headed chan@@ cell@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ sta@@ yers Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Franç@@ ois Hol@@ lan@@ de is facing re-@@ election or replacement in 20@@ 17 .
He is a f@@ ading force too .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
It &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Bri@@ ts , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tenden@@ cies .
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , S@@ N@@ P-@@ style , during the UK &apos;s 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my p@@ al suggests .
&quot; The rene@@ goti@@ ation was a fix &quot; and &quot; Britain got nothing of value out of the rene@@ goti@@ ation . &quot;
The Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU-@@ scep@@ tic the oli@@ gar@@ ch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony B@@ enn@@ -@@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They may di@@ mly remember Bor@@ is John@@ son , the arch Euro-@@ opport@@ un@@ ist , making his name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 9@@ 0s .
For all his foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness E@@ d Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
They included the me@@ d@@ ley of tax@@ -@@ sh@@ y ra@@ sc@@ als , ph@@ one-@@ h@@ acking foreigners and p@@ seu@@ do non-@@ d@@ oms who own most of our great newspapers .
Ac@@ tually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a rand@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ anas to di@@ stra@@ ct it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
In fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ rite than Blair in opposing Cam@@ eron &apos;s referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conc@@ eded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get@@ -@@ out card .
The press never for@@ gave him that either .
But nice Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ adopting N@@ eil Kinnock &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evol@@ ving .
He says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s wo@@ ad-@@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of T@@ ory little Eng@@ l@@ ander@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
It &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A B@@ enn , but not a B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; B@@ enn said on radio and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him stru@@ gg@@ led not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ ra@@ sive John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old dad stru@@ gg@@ led on TV to be dis@@ lo@@ yal to Labour cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
But fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MP@@ s at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
Whatever the bot@@ tom@@ -up , tou@@ ch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ strom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
It &apos;s fair enough not to give Cam@@ eron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell has said .
Simon Jen@@ k@@ ins certainly thinks so .
But Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equi@@ vocation about EU membership - consistent with their B@@ enn@@ ite sie@@ ge economy , anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among le@@ ftw@@ ing dis@@ sidents for whom the nar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ sm of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doc@@ trin@@ al squ@@ ab@@ bles .
As with his equi@@ vocation over Nat@@ o - Tom Watson is ad@@ am@@ ant that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to qu@@ it - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspi@@ cious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be poin@@ tless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Bri@@ ts &quot; fe@@ eb@@ le military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-@@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
Exper@@ ts critic@@ ise Public Health England e-@@ cigare@@ ttes review
C@@ laim@@ s by a govern@@ ment-@@ funded agency that e-@@ cigare@@ ttes are 95 % less harmful than smoking aro@@ se from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
Exper@@ ts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lan@@ c@@ et in critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in its report on e-@@ cigare@@ ttes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; land@@ mark &quot; report last month , descri@@ bing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
But several researchers have ques@@ tioned the robu@@ st@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An edi@@ torial in the Lan@@ c@@ et medical journ@@ al last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily f@@ lim@@ sy foundation &quot; on which PH@@ E based its main conclusion .
Wri@@ ting in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have ques@@ tioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hygi@@ ene and Trop@@ ical Medi@@ cine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : &quot; A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
They said the public would expect PH@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e-@@ cigare@@ ttes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
In fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi-@@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) model to synthe@@ si@@ se their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different nic@@ ot@@ ine-@@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one spon@@ sor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco for an independent study .
He also endorsed B@@ AT &apos;s public health cre@@ denti@@ als in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-@@ cigare@@ tte manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris International , they added .
The ration@@ ale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-@@ cigare@@ tte champ@@ ions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PH@@ E .
The research paper produced by the group &quot; t@@ ell@@ ingly conce@@ des &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
However , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said PH@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e-@@ cigare@@ ttes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-@@ smo@@ kers &quot; were pre@@ mature .
Pro@@ f Kev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well@@ being at PH@@ E , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
He said : &quot; E-@@ cigare@@ ttes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
One in two lifelong smo@@ kers dies from their addi@@ ction .
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-@@ cigare@@ ttes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
N@@ early 80@@ ,000 people a year die of a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ HS £ 2@@ bn a year .
By sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-@@ cigare@@ ttes are not ris@@ k-@@ free , they carry only a fra@@ ction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ mit .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Lu@@ ke John@@ son has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying its commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ ap .
John@@ son said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be wat@@ ched by a smaller audience in tough slo@@ ts against its ri@@ vals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
After the BBC &apos;s director general , Tony Hall , said the cor@@ poration wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , John@@ son said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a ti@@ e-@@ up with the BBC without success .
&quot; I do struggle with the idea that the BBC c@@ ommis@@ sions and broad@@ casts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; John@@ son told the House of L@@ ords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you keep the licence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren &apos;t making and commission@@ ing .
They broadcast The Vo@@ ice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
The idea that no one else would show that is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us , it &apos;s obviously non@@ sense .
John@@ son said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a re@@ gressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without sub@@ sidy .
The Vo@@ ice is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly made in-house .
Frank@@ ly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think that would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
John@@ son , a serial entrepren@@ eur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . &quot;
His comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lec@@ ture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
John@@ son said the BBC &apos;s more nich@@ e public service programmes &quot; go on to BB@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their re@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ tim@@ oni@@ ous missions about justi@@ fying £ 4@@ bn in licence fee income , &quot; Well of course , we do all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one wat@@ ched . &quot;
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
On the licence fee , John@@ son told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
Of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don &apos;t consu@@ me a lot of the BBC .
For@@ mer Sky and Channel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should rev@@ ise its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
He said little of the BBC &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.@@ 1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada and change it to &quot; inform , en@@ ligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
On the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a hand@@ ful were shown on TV , and enter into alli@@ ances with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make them all available to watch online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses .
Scienti@@ sts have b@@ red wor@@ ms with genetically modified ner@@ vous systems that can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
The tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high-@@ pit@@ ched for humans to hear .
The pul@@ ses work by switching on motor ne@@ ur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry m@@ embran@@ e channels that respond to ultra@@ son@@ ic waves .
Rel@@ ated : Res@@ ear@@ chers read and write brain activity with light
Res@@ ear@@ chers said the wor@@ ms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , du@@ b@@ bed son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultra@@ sound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and mus@@ cle cells from outside the body .
S@@ re@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , a resear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an that the procedure could one day replace deep@@ -@@ brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ a@@ sive procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people &apos;s bra@@ ins to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
N@@ em@@ at@@ ode wor@@ ms do not usually react to ultra@@ sound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a flu@@ id containing micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
The bub@@ bles , he found , ampli@@ fy the ultra@@ son@@ ic waves which then pass inside the wor@@ ms .
The ampli@@ fied ultra@@ sound waves act on structures called TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels , found in the m@@ embran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms &quot; cells .
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
To make ultra@@ sound@@ -@@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their motor ne@@ ur@@ ons carried TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels .
When he applied ultra@@ sound to the modified creatures , the sound waves were ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they swit@@ ched on the modified motor ne@@ ur@@ ons .
The procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch ne@@ ur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
But Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over that technique .
Unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ bre to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultra@@ sound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ull .
&quot; We believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human ne@@ ur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultra@@ sound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
Other applications could focus on mus@@ cle cells and insu@@ lin@@ -@@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; They &apos;ve done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es at Am@@ nesty .
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors flo@@ g fantas@@ tically eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tic products .
In a press release , Sa@@ ab revealed an order from the US army for &quot; the shoul@@ der-@@ launched AT@@ 4@@ CS RS . &quot;
This includes a &quot; unique sha@@ pe@@ d-@@ charge war@@ head that delivers outstanding behin@@ d-@@ arm@@ our-@@ effects inside the target . &quot;
Whatever that does , it won &apos;t be pleasant .
Ei@@ ght golden rules for living in student halls
It &apos;s been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an obli@@ vious 19@@ -@@ year-old , still belie@@ ving in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ativ@@ ism , but it &apos;s only now I recall the stra@@ ined sm@@ iles of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed into eight simple rules .
Mo@@ ving into halls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve-@@ ra@@ cking to totally terri@@ fying .
It &apos;s temp@@ ting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honest@@ ly neither love nor h@@ ate Mar@@ mit@@ e because seriously guys it &apos;s just ye@@ ast extract HA@@ HA@@ H@@ A I &apos;ll be in my room . &quot;
Take a bre@@ ath .
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
It ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to sc@@ out out the people you like ver@@ sus those you w@@ ouldn &apos;t talk to even if your ey@@ el@@ ash@@ es were on fire and they were disp@@ ens@@ ing ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers .
Gi@@ ve people space .
People &apos;s rooms often mor@@ ph into drinks recep@@ tions , mo@@ vie@@ -@@ night venues and commun@@ al han@@ g@@ out spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dres@@ sed and adjust their under@@ wear .
Rel@@ ated : Don &apos;t even think about starting university in a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
Your room should be a retreat , yet many halls form an inter-@@ room@@ -@@ stro@@ lling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to lifelong friend@@ ships .
That can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to rech@@ arge .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve expen@@ ded on inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhau@@ sted from soci@@ alising - and maybe text instead of kno@@ cking .
Spe@@ aking of kno@@ cking : do it .
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn &apos;t locked he was invited in .
He saw some things .
Make friends through b@@ aking .
Since you &apos;re starting un@@ i at the height of Bak@@ e-@@ O@@ ff man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es seems margin@@ ally less wei@@ rd , less 1950@@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I bak@@ ed you something , now s@@ mile as I ask you personal questions . &quot;
Off@@ ering hom@@ em@@ ade tre@@ ats is a great way to make friends .
Your hous@@ em@@ ates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a tasty surprise .
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent bak@@ er .
Po@@ or@@ ly-@@ f@@ used l@@ umps of fl@@ our , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pre@@ tend to be as@@ le@@ ep when you kno@@ ck .
Ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student halls .
Obviously ni@@ cking some@@ ones chi@@ cken is the@@ ft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea ste@@ aling ?
Double check with the milk owner .
Ch@@ ances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re see@@ thing inside .
If someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my sympath@@ ies - but try to deal with it more mat@@ u@@ rely than my hall@@ m@@ ate , who tain@@ ted her milk with wash@@ ing-up liquid to pun@@ ish those who st@@ ole it .
She &apos;s in j@@ ail now .
You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
This isn &apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al people in glass houses .
A girl on my corri@@ dor asked her neigh@@ bour if they w@@ ouldn &apos;t mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3@@ am and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
They responded by turning it up .
When they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kin@@ dly let them sleep for two hours before b@@ lasting her own music , lo@@ cking her door as she left for her three-@@ hour ex@@ am .
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?
Conver@@ sely , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le-@@ bit@@ ingly aw@@ k@@ ward if you mist@@ ook a hall@@ m@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouse , ho@@ oked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get cu@@ sto@@ dy of all your mutual friends ?
Of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hall@@ m@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
In the exhi@@ lar@@ ating moment you realise someone &apos;s left their keys inside their un@@ locked room , the line between p@@ ranking and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
A good p@@ rank is fun@@ ny , but takes moments to reverse .
Te@@ ach a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security by hi@@ ding something - but never tra@@ sh someone &apos;s room with to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ ste and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o .
Lo@@ ck their door and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the free@@ zer - but don &apos;t Blu@@ -T@@ ack their poss@@ essions to the ceiling more than twice .
Terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low ear@@ ners
Property entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses in the Middle Fran@@ con@@ ian town of Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
For example for refugees – but also as a sign : &quot; Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . &quot;
&quot; I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays , &quot; says the 4@@ 4-@@ year-old in an interview .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
Ent@@ re@@ pren@@ eur Mar@@ cus Gil@@ dner believes he knows how quickly economical housing can be developed : with this project he is building terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
What solution are you offering ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : M@@ ass accommodation in containers and gy@@ ms is not sustainable .
Because most of the people will be staying here .
We will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influ@@ x of refugees over the next decades .
A totally standard three-@@ sto@@ rey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : A terra@@ ced house needs little space .
It facilit@@ ates integration .
It is different when the people are hou@@ sed in blocks of flat@@ s .
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers .
Each living unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , one kitchen and a lounge .
It &apos;s possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I &apos;m going back .
Then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
What are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : The price for 160 m ² of living space per house amounts to € 18@@ 4@@ ,000 without land .
That is man@@ age@@ able .
Con@@ struction took six months .
That is reasonable .
Did building regulations complic@@ ate your plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
The s@@ word of Dam@@ oc@@ les threatening special building projects , and parking space regulations , always make it complicated .
Sc@@ ary .
It is still assumed that anyone creating three flat@@ s in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three parking places .
Exc@@ ept that there is not enough space in towns .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How have residents re@@ acted to your terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : There were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers .
That is definitely not true .
But aren &apos;t you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gil@@ dner : The truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommodation that has been built , which hardly anybody can afford any longer .
My project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays .
This is what it is about .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Sett@@ ings app , ta@@ pping &quot; General , &quot; and then selecting &quot; Software Update . &quot;
If it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
Some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that &quot; Software update failed . &quot;
To get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rus@@ h to die down , or to try and upgrade through i@@ Tunes .
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
That might include del@@ eting app@@ s to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by s@@ lim@@ ming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest app@@ s to delete and then re-@@ install them once the process is over .
It &apos;s worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the update happens , so that it doesn &apos;t run out of battery .
If the charge is too low , Apple won &apos;t let the update go ahead , since the phone dying hal@@ f@@ way through could lead to the update breaking .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in his fight for the Formul@@ a One world champ@@ ionship title against his clearly leading Merce@@ des te@@ amm@@ ate Le@@ wis Ham@@ il@@ ton : &quot; Full attack &quot; .
The world champ@@ ionship run@@ n@@ er-@@ up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races &quot; that I &apos;ve got nothing more to lose &quot; .
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday , 53 points divide the vice world champion from the ti@@ t@@ le@@ holder and two times champion Ham@@ il@@ ton .
The Bri@@ t has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floo@@ d@@ lit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite .
In 2009 and in the prec@@ eding year the 30-@@ year-old Bri@@ t was able to win the race .
Whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet unclear .
A p@@ all of smo@@ g has been han@@ ging over the city for days , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ at@@ ra .
Bad Kis@@ singer ch@@ ess club has a prominent member
The &quot; Ch@@ ess friends of Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen &quot; ch@@ ess club , founded three months ago , has admitted another member to its ranks , taking the number of members to 19 players .
The new member is business@@ man Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passion@@ ate ch@@ ess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen more than 40 times for spa treatments .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and is a fre@@ em@@ an of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the ch@@ ess club in Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen with a donation which was accepted by chairman Al@@ fred Kl@@ ein .
This makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
Youth work and talent sear@@ ches can also be pursued .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants his membership of the ch@@ ess club as well as his friendly contact with the &quot; Re@@ d-@@ white &quot; tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the spa town .
Accomm@@ odation office seeks fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face contact
S@@ alu@@ dis and the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft retirement centre have group@@ ed together under the man@@ tle of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Gra@@ f-@@ St@@ auff@@ en@@ ber@@ g-@@ Platz .
In addition to obtaining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there .
The social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre .
More precisely , to Gra@@ f-@@ St@@ auff@@ en@@ ber@@ g-@@ Platz .
A new accommodation office will be opening there shortly .
Here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nur@@ sing insurance or the services of nur@@ sing and health insurance companies .
With our out@@ patient care service we have for years realised that family care@@ gi@@ vers are often left alone .
This raises numerous questions .
&quot; Not in@@ frequently , too , many services provided by insur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , &quot; the new manager , J@@ ut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people &apos;s welfare is also responsible for the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; out@@ patient services , explained .
Apart from advice , the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention , health and wellness .
S@@ alu@@ dis has been taken on board for this .
As a result , additional offer@@ ings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapy treatment are also available .
The offers from the senior citizens centre and from S@@ alu@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
S@@ alu@@ dis represents prevention , precau@@ tion , and rehabilitation .
&quot; The senior citizens &apos; centre for care and nur@@ sing , &quot; is how Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , managing director of S@@ alu@@ dis describes it .
Both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centre as democratic change ,
as this makes a good decentrali@@ sed infrastructure in the individual districts of B@@ am@@ berg essential in the future .
Furthermore , as Mayor Wolfgang M@@ etz@@ ner ( SP@@ D ) under@@ lined at the opening ceremony , the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . &quot; There are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend inv@@ it@@ ations to regular social gather@@ ings &quot; .
Thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .
The accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

It &apos;s something special for our team to be playing against a third le@@ ague team .
We are hoping to get a large number of spec@@ t@@ ators , and not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ lit games have a special appeal .

Vi@@ enn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang dies at the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 , according to the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday .
In Men@@ g the Künstler@@ haus has lost an hon@@ our@@ ary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; it is reported .

Men set upon 17@@ -@@ year-old Af@@ gan
Police are seeking witn@@ esses to an incident in Bad So@@ den@@ -S@@ al@@ mün@@ ster . At about 11.@@ 45 on Friday evening , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
According to police one of the group , a 17@@ -@@ year-old Afghan , was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
At this point the group were level with the b@@ ft pet@@ rol station .
Three people were standing on the pet@@ rol station premises .
One of these men sh@@ ou@@ ted at the youth and hit him in the face with his f@@ ist .
This broke the victim &apos;s nose and his nose b@@ led heavily .
One of his two friends ran to him and beg@@ ged the attack@@ er to let the victim go .
The injured young man was taken home by his friends .
The perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group to their home in a car and dro@@ ve past it several times in an ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous manner .
As soon as they could no longer see the car , the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigare@@ tte .
There he was attacked again by his original attack@@ er and another male .
Using a club , they beat the victim in the face and upper leg .
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
Up to now there is only a vague description of the perpet@@ r@@ ators .
One was a man of about 5@@ ft 11@@ in t@@ all .
The second attack@@ er was about 5@@ ft 5@@ in t@@ all and was dres@@ sed in je@@ ans and a brown and white shirt .

Dr Frank Müller takes over Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10,000
Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over practice from Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen .
The may@@ or of the joint community , Ber@@ nd Bor@@ mann , business spon@@ sor U@@ ta Sei@@ m-@@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dorf &apos;s may@@ or Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are delighted at this turn of events .
Many areas in the country have no doctor – A@@ sen@@ dorf by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October Dr Frank Müller is taking over the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice .
While Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen is reti@@ ring , her husband Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich will spend the next few months working part-@@ time with his successor .
Dr Müller re@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
When the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr Sil@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at the time were finishing their residen@@ cies in Ver@@ den hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
&quot; It was always in the back of our minds that the Müll@@ ers would fit into this practice well , &quot; says Dr Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen and lau@@ ghs .
&quot; When we were ready , I simply called them up . &quot;
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; The proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , &quot; says 3@@ 9-@@ year-old Müller .
&quot; We want to get to know the families and support them over the years . &quot;
He also sees being his own bo@@ ss as a benefit .
And so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers would buy the house with the practice .
However in the meantime they are living in Bru@@ ch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
Father of two Frank Müller also grew up there and after his medical studies in Han@@ over he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg und Rot@@ enburg .
He is currently working as a consul@@ tant in Sul@@ ingen , furthermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the county of Die@@ ph@@ olz in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bru@@ ch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
From 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new bo@@ ss .
While sur@@ ge@@ on Dr Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen worked as a general practi@@ tion@@ er , his wife Ur@@ sel ( a specialist in internal medicine ) specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
The Müll@@ ers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general practi@@ tion@@ ers .
&quot; So it &apos;s out with the endo@@ scop@@ y , &quot; says 3@@ 8-@@ year-old Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ultra@@ sound exam@@ inations as well as long-term and stress EK@@ G@@ s and we need one more consulting room .
The IT system will also be completely renewed .
The Müll@@ ers are receiving a grant tot@@ alling € 50@@ ,000 as part of a funding programme from the county ( € 2,@@ 500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 12@@ ,@@ 500 ) and the local authority ( € 12@@ ,@@ 500 ) .
&quot; This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , &quot; stressed the may@@ or of the joint community Ber@@ nd Bor@@ mann .
According to Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , some 2@@ ,000 patients visit the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
There is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen , the chem@@ ist will stay in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
If they ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t found any successor , it would have closed down .
Anyone visiting the Müll@@ ers &apos; surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assi@@ stants and the clean@@ er from the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens .
With their leaving , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
&quot; We started with only two rooms , &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen with a gr@@ in .
After such a long time she feels a little wi@@ st@@ ful .
&quot; But we &apos;ll still be living in Ho@@ hen@@ mo@@ or and I &apos;m sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , &quot; says the internal medicine specialist .
Her husband adds with a s@@ mile , &quot; We &apos;ve got a 6@@ 000 m ² garden . &quot;
&quot; Up to now I haven &apos;t done much gar@@ dening , that might change now . &quot;
The couple also have two grand@@ children and enjoy travelling .
Croatia : &quot; We are letting the refugees through &quot;
&quot; B@@ order control is being brought in now on our southern border too , &quot; says Inter@@ ior Minister Johann@@ a Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner .
In parallel , checks on the Hungarian border remain in place .
It is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can &quot; of course &quot; do so .
The care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
It is equally clear &quot; that obvious signals are needed , &quot; says the minister .
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration , and not over the Austri@@ an@@ -S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ian border either .
A controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a &quot; corri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia has refused .
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish corri@@ d@@ ors for the refugees .
However , Inter@@ ior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach did not see it in quite the same light .
The idea of corri@@ d@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slov@@ ein@@ a intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary .
The border with Croatia , as the external border to the Schengen area , is however already heavily controlled .
But as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not sugge@@ sting se@@ aling its borders for refugees .
&quot; Every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
According to the Croatian government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the To@@ var@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing , in order to avoid registration .
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize field .
Since then , according to local media , police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian T@@ av@@ ar@@ nik .
They are mostly Syri@@ an and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
The emergency se@@ vi@@ ces and the Red Cross are also already in place .
Inter@@ ior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days .
In addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ oni@@ an-@@ Serbian border , which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border , are being diver@@ ted to Croatia
The government in Bel@@ grade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . &quot; We neither can nor want to do that , &quot; they stated .
According to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
Over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The de@@ tain@@ ees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Maced@@ onian border , about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; We heard that Hungary is closed , so the police said we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
They wanted to go through Croatia , Slowen@@ ia and Austria to get to Germany .
This implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predic@@ ted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : &quot; Wi@@ des@@ pread options for border control &quot;
Croatian Inter@@ ior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influ@@ x of refugees .
He gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non-@@ member of the Schengen Treaty , has &quot; widespread options for border control . &quot;
Rig@@ or@@ ous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ e@@ gen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
There are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border f@@ ence .
According to media reports from Bel@@ grade , they spent the past night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
The Hungarian authorities claim that both the Hor@@ gos and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cross@@ ings also remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear .
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Inter@@ ior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Ste@@ fan@@ o@@ vic , tried to re@@ assure people : he considers the debate on the refugees &apos; alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be pre@@ mature .
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
But private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still un@@ cle@@ ared min@@ e@@ fields .
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ es@@ we@@ e@@ pers has been sent to the border region .

E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care celeb@@ rates 20 years in Mannheim
Business rules around the Par@@ ade@@ platz in Mannheim
People carry out their err@@ ands , some of them walking br@@ is@@ k@@ ly , some of them stro@@ lling along in a lei@@ surely fashion .
They head for the two branches of the Mannheim car show@@ room .
Tra@@ ms stop .
Pul@@ sing , vibrant life in the brilliant autumn sunshine , and right in the middle are four big black@@ boards each bearing the words , &quot; Before I die I want to … &quot;
The E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary , and is encounter@@ ing extremely mixed reactions .
&quot; It &apos;s about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
The head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , as are voluntary workers .
While many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by impul@@ sively gra@@ b the chal@@ k and complete the sentence with &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; be able to read &quot; , &quot; drive through the USA in a camp@@ er van &quot; , &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for long &quot; , others stop briefly , read , say things like &quot; I &apos;m not ready for that yet &quot; , and carry on .
Again and again little discussions develop in cor@@ ners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also there now .
&quot; It &apos;s only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live respon@@ sibly , &quot; says the Director of the Prote@@ stant social char@@ ity Di@@ ak@@ onischen Werk in Mannheim , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ it@@ as Association for E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care .
Which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20-@@ year-old organisation .
Of course it &apos;s understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the black@@ boards ; in the end it &apos;s a very personal matter .
The topics of life and death are still ste@@ ep@@ ed in tab@@ oo@@ s , according to Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hosp@@ ice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .
A perception shared by Ange@@ li@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
The volunte@@ er worker , who helps people to deal with death and grie@@ f , has been with the organisation from the start .
Having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
When the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation appe@@ aled for volunte@@ er hel@@ pers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the San@@ kt Vinc@@ ent Hosp@@ ice .
They are all carefully trained .
Ange@@ li@@ ka Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id is particularly well suited to handling this job and the experiences and everything it entails .
&quot; I see life from a different point of view , I believe it is precious and I sei@@ ze the moment , &quot; she says .
The out@@ patient services offered by the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice organisation are free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ation@@ ally independent .
Financial support from health insurance companies and donations by members enable education as well as training sessions , and training and supervision for pal@@ li@@ ative care providers and grie@@ f coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors .
Training for new staff is offered every two years .
The black@@ boards , with the messages written on them on Saturday , are now on display in the Evange@@ lical church ( M@@ 1 , 1@@ a ) and the Catholic church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
Anyone who wants to can also write their own personal wishes on post@@ cards there .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x earnings mixed , lo@@ wers fiscal 20@@ 16 outlook
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-@@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
The company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
At this time last year , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x announced it would hire 50@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday &apos;s opening bell .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 c@@ ents from an earlier pre@@ diction .
An@@ alyst@@ s expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hi@@ kes aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-@@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was &quot; performing soli@@ dly given weak@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
The holi@@ da@@ y-@@ hi@@ ring plans were announced a day after ri@@ val UPS said that that it plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hi@@ red last year .
In the quarter that ended Aug@@ . 31 , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
Ear@@ nings per share amoun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 an@@ alyst@@ s surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
Re@@ venue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
Six an@@ alyst@@ s surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stag@@ n@@ ate .
But the boom in online shopping has boo@@ sted results at F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Gro@@ und .
In the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-@@ insurance .
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
In pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bell , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
At their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 2@@ 7-@@ foot Hon@@ du@@ ran ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Lo@@ oming over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s orn@@ ate , two-@@ story bo@@ ard@@ room will be a mu@@ ral of the United States .
The map is a remin@@ der that Fed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
But since the Great Rec@@ ession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
And that third mandate could be the X-@@ factor in a to@@ o-@@ clo@@ se-@@ to-@@ predi@@ ct decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being we@@ an@@ ed from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near@@ -@@ zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
Even though most data show the economy growing soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could make al@@ read@@ y-@@ cau@@ tious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the vol@@ atility by raising their bench@@ mark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market@@ place is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &quot; she said .
There &apos;s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
About half of economists surve@@ yed recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg predic@@ ted a rate increase this week .
Financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to so@@ ften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
On Tuesday , the Do@@ w Jones industrial average j@@ ump@@ ed 2@@ 28@@ .@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
The rally was trig@@ gered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
&quot; It would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
If Fed policymakers did , &quot; they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t pan@@ ic . &quot;
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed .
Although job creation s@@ lowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
W@@ age gains have shown signs of pi@@ cking up .
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of shar@@ ply lower oil prices .
The economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , &quot; said I@@ an Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ economics .
But financial markets around the world started conv@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
The Do@@ w Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors fe@@ ared a s@@ lowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
The market has re@@ bound@@ ed somewhat this month , with the Do@@ w now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
For Fed policymakers , the market tur@@ mo@@ il adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; Ab@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tigh@@ tening at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the UC@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official .
Now , he predic@@ ts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the imp@@ acts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-@@ dates the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
The health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the Fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision-making .
But , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
The central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
The mere hin@@ t by th@@ en-@@ Chairman Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the Fed might &quot; ta@@ per &quot; its monetary expansion trig@@ gered market conv@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central ban@@ kers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
Its decision-making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for weal@@ th-@@ management firm En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
J@@ eff@@ rey L@@ ack@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , V@@ a . , noted this month that &quot; the Fed has a history of over@@ re@@ acting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the policy@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , c@@ ited decisions in 199@@ 8-@@ 99 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its bench@@ mark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identi@@ fiable implications for U.S. growth , &quot; L@@ ack@@ er said .
A year later , Fed officials rever@@ sed those cuts .
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market mel@@ t@@ down , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rat@@ e-@@ setting committee .
The latest tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; You certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being sc@@ ared of a rate hi@@ ke because markets got up@@ set , &quot; said Po@@ sen , president of the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a bit of help for refugees
These days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
To prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary hel@@ pers .
In Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is also a whole range of people who un@@ sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ly support asylum seekers in the town .
Among these are Pet@@ ra und Klaus H@@ eine .
Pet@@ ra H@@ eine is a dedicated teacher .
Even at 74 she still lo@@ ves teaching .
Every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
There she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pe@@ di@@ atri@@ c Society of Rio Grande Pro@@ mot@@ es He@@ al@@ thy Bre@@ ast@@ feeding Di@@ ets
Brazilian pedi@@ atri@@ c organization SP@@ RS has come up with a sho@@ cking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while bre@@ ast@@ feeding , by featuring images of bab@@ ies su@@ ck@@ ling from bre@@ asts painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of prot@@ eins , f@@ ats , vit@@ am@@ ins , and car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates , which give bab@@ ies all the nutri@@ ents they need to grow a strong immune system .
Due to excess energy requirements , pregn@@ ant women and new m@@ oms are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
However , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ orie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment mothers should make .
A recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medi@@ cine in Texas revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pregn@@ ant women actually affected the genetic expression of their bab@@ ies and protected them from developing tum@@ ors .
Unfortunately , un@@ healthy di@@ ets were found to neg@@ atively affect the child &apos;s immune system .
Ex@@ cep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
Bern@@ ried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.@@ 3 million sports hall .
And it is making an exception .
The roof may be f@@ latter to accommodate a solar energy system .
Plan@@ ning for the long-@@ awa@@ ited sports building on the Bern@@ ried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
The committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an &quot; exception &quot; , or rather an &quot; exemption &quot; under building law to the applicable building plan .
The &quot; exception &quot; refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure .
According to this a &quot; g@@ able roof with an off-@@ centre ri@@ dge and roof over@@ hang &quot; will be constructed .
The background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels . &quot; This means we will have a wonder@@ fully large south-@@ facing roof , &quot; explained may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
The &quot; exemption &quot; on the other hand refers to the roof pit@@ ch , which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipul@@ ations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
This will reduce the volume of the hall .
Therefore an &quot; exemption &quot; is necessary , since the development plan allows no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to roof pit@@ ch - while the Bern@@ ried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemp@@ tions .
The sports hall is however more of a recur@@ ring project . &quot; We are not setting a precedent with this , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bern@@ ried .
Co@@ sts have been calculated at around € 2.@@ 3 million .
Con@@ tri@@ butions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
In the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 met@@ re hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg Clin@@ ic moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
The P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg Hospital is closing earlier than planned – in 20@@ 16 .
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hospital .
The wards and the majority of employees are moving to Sch@@ on@@ gau from P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg .
This allows for the district &apos;s limited company hospital &apos;s surprising plans , confirms district administrator Andrea Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss .
The Board of Directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
If these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg will remain in employment .
The vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
The premises are available .
Those employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ on@@ gau will be offered positions in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss .
Emplo@@ ye@@ es have been informed about the plans .
The changes were trig@@ gered by the re@@ sign@@ ation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the Sch@@ on@@ gau clin@@ ic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
When the question of who his successor should be , according to Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; , who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau , was raised .
For the Sch@@ on@@ gau hospital , these changes mean an &quot; upgrade &quot; and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss .
Fis@@ her is a specialist in car@@ di@@ ac pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ l@@ lat@@ ors .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) speciali@@ ses in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological dis@@ orders in its internal medicine department .
In the transi@@ tionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both establishments , and in the next year the former min@@ ers &apos; hospital in P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
Thus far the district has planned this for 20@@ 18 , when the currently ongoing restoration of the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is finished .
District administrator Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contradi@@ cts rum@@ ours that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Min@@ ers , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I can rule that out . &quot; What will happen to the building , Jo@@ chn@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss cannot say ; that needs more consideration .
At the moment a Car@@ it@@ as short-term care facility and a day@@ time psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c facility are hou@@ sed there .
&quot; It &apos;s the best thing that could have happened for us ; we won &apos;t get this sort of opportunity again , &quot; says Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which has been accepted &quot; positively and with understanding &quot; by employees .
Real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physi@@ cian do not really exist .
He was asked by his colleagues at Sch@@ on@@ gau to take over the post of medical director .
The Pi@@ essen@@ berg hospital , which once had 100 beds , has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades . De@@ partments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ etri@@ cs .
The hand@@ ball@@ ers of Rhein@@ -@@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lö@@ wen are being challeng@@ ed this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .
The leaders of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a are the clear favou@@ rites in W@@ up@@ per@@ tal , however there are no grounds for arrogan@@ ce .
In the past season the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at B@@ HC and they have some ground to make up there .
Two injured in hunting accident near P@@ rat@@ au
Two trac@@ tor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the ma@@ ize harv@@ est on Tuesday after@@ no@@ o@@ on .
A number of hun@@ ts@@ men were in action on a cor@@ n field near P@@ rat@@ au ( Wit@@ ten@@ burg district ) during the harv@@ est , according to police .
After shots were fi@@ red , two men , one 63 and the other 22 , suffered severe inj@@ uries and were taken to hospital .
The precise cause of the accident was initially unclear .
Criminal investig@@ ators are trying to determine the details .
Mis@@ sing 16-@@ year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine the victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-@@ year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine who has been missing since Saturday .
When ques@@ tioned the 20-@@ year-old admitted to having killed the teen@@ ager and thrown her body into a can@@ al in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
Six@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old missing from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
The body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen near Kais@@ er@@ slau@@ tern the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police reported on Wednesday .
A 20-@@ year-old suspect , who conf@@ essed to the crime and led investig@@ ators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
The 16-@@ year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
In their search for the young woman , investig@@ ators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
Inter@@ views with the missing girl &apos;s circle of friends and acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces ultimately resulted in 20-@@ year-old becoming a suspect .
The pre@@ sum@@ ed perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a can@@ al in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen , where the body was found .
Under inter@@ ro@@ gation the arrested man conf@@ essed the police that he had killed the 16-@@ year-old and thrown her body in the can@@ al .
The 20-@@ year-old will be brought before the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate on Wednesday ; investig@@ ators have reduced the charge to one of man@@ slau@@ ghter .
Further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
Press@@ ure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The struggle for al@@ locations in the German housing market began long ago .
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are crow@@ ding into a market which in many large towns is already over@@ bur@@ dened .
They are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
To supply the demand for affordable homes , 400@@ ,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
This is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the &quot; Social H@@ ous@@ ing &quot; federation of associations .
In comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
This amounts to a short@@ fall of 14@@ 0@@ ,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation .
Many then push onto the housing market and stand in long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of rental flat@@ s .
According to the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as ten@@ ants .
The negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study points to significant fail@@ ings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
There is a current short@@ fall in urban areas of around 7@@ 70@@ ,000 living units l@@ aments Matthias G@@ ün@@ ther , author of the study .
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
Due to the sl@@ ump in the housing market , young adults of necessity live longer in &quot; Hotel M@@ ama &quot; .
In large towns over the last few years , the number of square metres per head has decre@@ ased for the first time .
In order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social H@@ ous@@ ing &quot; alliance suggests a fresh start .
New incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
For example land transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for spon@@ sored housing temporarily suspended .
In addition , according to the association , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
The K@@ f@@ W state bank &apos;s refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
On Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 18@@ 4 million – more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available – had already been requested .
The project may now even be step@@ ped up .
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have safe conduct : Croatia and Slovenia put corri@@ dor in place
Since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles .
However the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corri@@ dor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Inter@@ ior , and if necessary we will organise a corri@@ dor , &quot; said Croatian Minister for the Inter@@ ior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
After the se@@ aling off of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
Five hundred people came over the border at To@@ var@@ nik , reports Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had c@@ ord@@ oned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
Moreover , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
The Croatian Prime Minister Z@@ or@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explains , &quot; They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility &quot; .
These people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
They are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neigh@@ bour Croatia in the morning .
According to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They arrived at the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and in tax@@ is .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
At the Croati@@ an-@@ Serbian border the refugees did not come across border f@@ ences .
The border stri@@ ps hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
It is now planned for min@@ es@@ we@@ e@@ pers to quickly create a safe passage .
Meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
On Tuesday police counted 3@@ 66 people that they had picked up .
Shor@@ tly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,@@ 3@@ 80 .
The new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy climbing and damaging the border f@@ ences as criminal offences .
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
Those convi@@ cted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extra@@ dition from the country .
According to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new &quot; transition zone &quot; set up at the border , almost all – 93 – at the biggest crossing at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
In practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary .
According to opinion in Hungary , Serbia is &quot; a safe third country &quot; .
The rejected asylum seekers will be de@@ ported there .
Only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by &quot; the transition zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Wor@@ kers have begun to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
They are collecting the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
Cro@@ w@@ d barriers are being disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border town is being re@@ built .
No one wants to talk about the goal of this re@@ building .
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
According to the go@@ ver@@ ment , around 20@@ ,000 migrants are still in the country .
In Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
In Freil@@ ass@@ ing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor drives &quot; str@@ anded people &quot; over the border
&quot; We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with su@@ it@@ cases , &quot; says Mayor of W@@ ern@@ stein A@@ lo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
Tou@@ rists who wanted to get to Passa@@ u by train .
Because Germany had un@@ expec@@ tedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influ@@ x of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the str@@ anded people over the border to Passa@@ u .
Before that we enter@@ tained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks .
We said at once that we would take them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; It was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
They were very grateful .
One man insi@@ sted on hand@@ ing over a generous donation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
&quot; We were very pleased about that , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
The str@@ anded train passengers had changed trains in W@@ els on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Passa@@ u after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
But the regional train was stopped before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
In W@@ ern@@ stein , excursions over the border are generally very popular .
The Bridge Festival is a joint effort between W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kir@@ chen ; the Bridge Festival Association organis@@ es the social event on Sunday and an athle@@ tic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours .
The fact that Vi@@ ktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypo@@ critical policies :
Instead of providing immediate help to the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp by construc@@ ting structures which ensure a level of humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government &apos;s stance closer to an atmosphere of national soci@@ alism .
It is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ o@@ tic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
Those who have fl@@ ed , too , must notice that the &quot; promised land &quot; which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
It will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create humane conditions for asylum seekers .
There is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Kon@@ rad is looking for w@@ inter-@@ proof accommodation for 35@@ ,000
Kon@@ rad has his hands full with the hosting of refugees .
Christian Kon@@ rad is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
The government has engaged the former powerful Ra@@ i@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen ban@@ ker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees .
Kon@@ rad has already got to gri@@ ps with the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen reception centre .
&quot; We no longer have any hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen , &quot; he reported on his first achievement .
And the accommodation of the 20@@ ,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great f@@ uss , said Kon@@ rad , pra@@ ising the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ piece &quot; .
The Minister of the Inter@@ ior , however , talked of a &quot; critical situation &quot; .
In total , Kon@@ rad estimates that accommodation for 8@@ 5,000 will be required in the current year .
In order to meet this figure , accommodation for another 35@@ ,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20@@ ,000 to be provided for by the states and 15@@ ,000 by the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can manage .
&quot; But it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; says Kon@@ rad .
He has already carried out talks with the State Govern@@ ors .
They have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
&quot; It is going well in Austria , &quot; says Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
The former VP mand@@ at@@ ary is assi@@ sting Kon@@ rad .
Tom@@ orrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ din@@ al Christoph Schön@@ born , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
The asylum coordin@@ ator has also got high expectations of the OR@@ F &quot; Help the way we are &quot; campaign .
Private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform .
It is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often empty in winter .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier yesterday cri@@ ti@@ si@@ sed the specifications for accommodation as &quot; too high &quot; .
In times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain hei@@ ghts for to@@ wel ra@@ ils or sizes of sky@@ lights .
&quot; Emer@@ gency standards &quot; should apply for a limited period .
Kon@@ rad uses his experience as justification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Inter@@ ior , should be successful with the accommodation .
I am an older man , and nobody readily tells un@@ tru@@ ths to my face
His most important weapon is the power of persu@@ asion .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier are not co@@ sting the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
The want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted to set up a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
But apparently there are problems with obtaining approval .
Linz demanding a better allocation
For the time being the city of Linz is not planning to open new sports halls and other buildings such as the Ti@@ ps Arena or the Design Centre as accommodation for refugees .
At the moment this should not be necess@@ s@@ ary , as the people in question can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
But in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their su@@ it@@ ability .
The town chief is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
Other districts should also make their own contributions .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; Bor@@ ders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off &quot;
In a long telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , State Govern@@ or Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off .
The on@@ ward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
However appropriate border controls do now exist .
There will now no longer be any special trains with refugees travelling to Germany .
Those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ühr@@ inger once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
The fact that Austria is also now re@@ introducing controls at its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of Germany &apos;s approach .
The next Run@@ t@@ as@@ tic is only a matter of time
The general renovation of the &quot; Neuen Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ tz industrial area is officially finished .
The publicly listed IT group S &amp; T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . It is planned that the rest ( 27@@ 00 m ² ) will be r@@ ented to young , innovative businesses in the technology sector .
&quot; In IT cle@@ ver heads are our raw material – and we must try to get them to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T bo@@ ss H@@ ann@@ es Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
He can imagine investing in star@@ t-@@ up businesses in Neuen Wer@@ ft , and also later acqu@@ iring these .
S &amp; T wants to collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours from the start – and Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; The next Run@@ t@@ as@@ tic is only a matter of time &quot; .
SM@@ T is investing € 1.@@ 7 million in the location and € 3.@@ 3 million is coming from Te@@ ch@@ centre , a third of which belongs to each of the town of Lin@@ tz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
The building is le@@ ased by Linz AG to S &amp; T and Te@@ ch@@ centre for 60 years .
Thir@@ ty percent of the remaining 27@@ 00 m ² in the building is already r@@ ented out and there have been en@@ quiries about the other 40 percent .
O@@ wn@@ er of Li@@ a Per@@ oni opens second business in the arc@@ ade .
In the new shop the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ ut@@ ta Bre@@ it actually wanted to get a dog .
The 4@@ 9-@@ year-old propri@@ et@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt arc@@ ade had to un@@ cerem@@ oni@@ ously postp@@ one this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
In the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business where she s@@ ells among other things bags , cases , shoes and gar@@ ments from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around Fur@@ la women &apos;s hand@@ bags ; pur@@ ses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
Lar@@ ger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
The new shop opened yesterday .
It has been converted over the last few weeks .
&quot; I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
Cru@@ cial for this decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la manufacturers , who are based in Bologna , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; We are the only people in the greater Lin@@ tz area who sell this brand , &quot; said the mother of two dau@@ gh@@ ters , who herself has Italian roots .
Bre@@ it got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cra@@ dle .
It suits me best if something emer@@ ges and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
The expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag .
Perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful hand@@ bag can enhance any out@@ fit .
The bra@@ g@@ gar@@ t from K@@ all@@ stadt
The Pal@@ at@@ ine ancest@@ ors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are known as bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
This characteristic also connects many with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always the source of contro@@ vers@@ y .
Whether he is expressing xen@@ opho@@ b@@ ic opinions , being ru@@ de to journalists or reve@@ aling gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a sti@@ r in the election campaign .
And comes out of it well .
This is also something that happens in the Pal@@ at@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ stadt , from where the property billi@@ on@@ aire &apos;s grand@@ parents origin@@ ate .
The New Yor@@ ker with the b@@ low-@@ dry hair@@ style is a concept to many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the wine route .
Many in the village of 1,@@ 200 inhabitants are related to him .
His grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
Sim@@ one Wen@@ del , a resident of K@@ all@@ stadt , has made a film about Tru@@ mp .
And what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of K@@ all@@ stadt people they are not deeply impressed .
The native of K@@ all@@ stadt has made an am@@ using documentary film about the place and its famous off@@ sho@@ ots , included in whom besides Tru@@ mp are also the Hein@@ z ket@@ ch@@ up family .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for his mo@@ dest@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in &quot; K@@ ings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt .
He has not won over the people there .
There is indeed a certain respect for his family &apos;s achievements , but there also tends to be a view that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit of a big@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
Co@@ inci@@ dentally , K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s nick@@ name in the region is , &quot; Die Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; , a dial@@ ect term which transl@@ ates as &quot; The Bra@@ g@@ gar@@ t &quot; , she says .
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
The story of the Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos; success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s grand@@ father em@@ ig@@ rated and opened a s@@ alo@@ on for gold prospec@@ tors in the USA .
The foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
But his grand@@ parents &apos; lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return permanently to their home country collap@@ sed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine then belon@@ ged .
They would not let Tru@@ mp enter as he had originally left without authorisation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Cultural Anth@@ rop@@ ology , Rol@@ and Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of &quot; illegal em@@ igrants &quot; .
This is at od@@ ds with the sometimes pi@@ thy statements of his desc@@ end@@ ant .
He has repeatedly spoken in dero@@ g@@ atory terms about Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; The f@@ uss he makes about it is not very nice , &quot; says Hans@@ -@@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; My grand@@ mother was born a Tru@@ mp , my grand@@ father was born a Hein@@ z &quot; ) .
The reti@@ red win@@ em@@ aker sees the American as rather alo@@ of , &quot; he always has a short f@@ use &quot; .
Does he think Tru@@ mp will come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 7@@ 2-@@ year-old .
&quot; He has never had any interest in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
Guest house land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like many of K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s inhabitants , men@@ tions that des@@ cen@@ dants of the Hein@@ z family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine Donald doing that , &quot; says the 6@@ 8-@@ year-old .
She would prefer it if he doesn &apos;t win the election as &quot; he has such radical opinions , I don &apos;t know whether it would be a good thing &quot; .
If anyone like him had been in charge in his grand@@ father &apos;s time , &quot; he would never have gone there &quot; .
&quot; There are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says win@@ em@@ aker &apos;s daughter Sar@@ ah Büh@@ ler .
And as president ?
&quot; He &apos;s certainly not my president , &quot; she says .
And , &quot; the gra@@ pes will ri@@ pen without President Tru@@ mp &quot; .
Wen@@ del &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp gave a lengthy interview , has been seen by 12@@ ,000 cin@@ em@@ a-@@ go@@ ers , and interest is also growing in the USA .
The Upper Bavarian district of Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Village &quot; .
The village of 1,@@ 800 inhabitants in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for &quot; Gent@@ le Tourism &quot; from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enn@@ ing , on Wednesday .
There are already 20 &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Vil@@ lages &quot; in Austria .
In our neighbouring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the distinction .
A &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Village &quot; is permitted to have a maximum of 2,@@ 500 residents .
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .

Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows , Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski may have un@@ wi@@ tt@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bach@@ el@@ or .
The woman who S@@ am W@@ ood ends up with on The Bach@@ el@@ or has been s@@ wa@@ th@@ ed in utmost sec@@ rec@@ y .
And the three girls left standing certainly aren &apos;t letting sli@@ p whether they are the one who received his final rose .
But when we checked in with Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski and Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows the day before three become two , they may have in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently given away a clu@@ e as to who the winner will be .
S@@ am W@@ ood is keeping his li@@ ps firmly se@@ aled until Thursday &apos;s fin@@ ale
All three women wa@@ xed ly@@ rical over why W@@ ood is the perfect man , c@@ iting his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positi@@ vity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
However when asked the question , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ ood &apos;s final rose ? , &quot; their answers could have provided a spo@@ iler as to who won the Bach@@ el@@ ors heart .
Both Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o@@ ski were quick to name M@@ ack@@ ay as , apart from themselves , the best match for W@@ ood .
Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ am W@@ ood have shared an easy rap@@ port since day one .
&quot; From the moment I wal@@ ked into the house , reading ( Sar@@ ah &apos;s ) energy and S@@ am &apos;s energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sar@@ ah is really down to earth , she &apos;s so much fun to be around , &quot; added Mark@@ o@@ ski .
I &apos;ve seen them together and they do have that chem@@ istry there .
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and S@@ am W@@ ood would be well suited as a couple .
For her part , M@@ ack@@ ay said last week &apos;s home visit dates made her realise W@@ ood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m wholeheartedly invested in him now , &quot; she said .
And asked who W@@ ood should choose if not her , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lan@@ a .

Because of the large number of refugees , the Freie Wähler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
At the start of the F@@ W autumn conc@@ la@@ ve , party and fac@@ tion leader Hu@@ bert Ai@@ wan@@ ger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new school@@ children : &quot; We need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collap@@ sing , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; Otherwise we will have up@@ heav@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
The Freie Wähler fac@@ tion is in session in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian community until Friday .
Very different main topics were originally planned .
But the record number of refugees is domin@@ ating the Freie Wähler meeting too .
&quot; Of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conc@@ la@@ ve , &quot; says Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yugosla@@ vian war in the nine@@ ties .
&quot; It can &apos;t go on like this , we have to get to the causes , &quot; says the Freie Wähler head .
The Freie Wähler want to de@@ port failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible .
For this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also wants more personnel for the ad@@ min@@ stra@@ tive courts , which are responsible for asylum cases : &quot; We need at least 50 new asylum judges as well , &quot; says Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
The F@@ W head criticised the lack of consistency between several federal states : &quot; We need unified standards in the Federal states nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria de@@ ports ; others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; We must be more efficient . &quot;
However , regional politics in Gross@@ wahl@@ stadt should not be allowed to suffer .
An issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
In the new school year the Education Minister , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CD@@ U ) , started a &quot; middle school plus &quot; pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in gram@@ mar@@ s schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry qualification ex@@ am .
But that is not enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; The G@@ 9 issue must be spee@@ ded up , &quot; says the F@@ W head .
We demand freedom of choice for all gram@@ mar schools that want it .
A free move to G@@ 9 everywhere it is wanted .

4 K@@ illed After Police Fire Rub@@ ber Bul@@ lets at Prote@@ sters in Nepal
Four people , including a 4-@@ year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fi@@ red rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pra@@ sad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 prote@@ sters had gathered outside a police station , some of them thro@@ wing stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs .
Mr. D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used te@@ ar gas and then fi@@ red into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
T@@ w@@ enty police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said .
It was not immediately clear why rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less@@ -@@ le@@ th@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
The clas@@ h was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal &apos;s southern pla@@ ins , where members of the Mad@@ h@@ es@@ i ethnic group say new provin@@ ces established under the proposed new constitution would di@@ lu@@ te their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clas@@ hes since Au@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provin@@ ces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly con@@ ten@@ tious issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been under@@ way since 2008 , but law@@ makers acceler@@ ated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
Law@@ makers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .
Con@@ tru@@ ction area planned in the town
The plot of land at the Al@@ te Post youth centre in Em@@ den is going to be built on again .
The town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square met@@ re area .
A mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Al@@ te Post youth centre .
Pre@@ par@@ ations are currently under@@ way .
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
A spo@@ kes@@ person for the town states that it is awaiting suitable offers .
The identi@@ ties of possible investors are not yet clear .
Consequently , no contract has yet been concluded .
The town of Em@@ den sold a part of the site , situated on the Ring@@ strasse / corner of Gro@@ sse Strasse a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demo@@ li@@ shed .
H@@ ie@@ ve project : facts are in the open
Plans for the holiday home development at the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are taking shape .
Invest@@ ors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
A number of residents are again concerned – they are worried about the sale of their leisure refuge .
Plans have been negotiated , mul@@ led over , debated , and p@@ lot@@ ted behind closed doors for months .
Now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are in the open .
The interested party , the Em@@ den company &quot; System@@ -B@@ au &quot; , presented their plans to the Em@@ den Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening .
Origin@@ ally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
Under pressure from critics of the project and from the F@@ DP fac@@ tion , who had accused investors and the administration of secre@@ tiveness , R@@ al@@ f B@@ ehr@@ ends of the System@@ -B@@ au management went on the offensive . &quot; We don &apos;t yet have an answer for all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spec@@ t@@ ators .
But it is good to be able to counter all the rum@@ ours now .
The € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Pic@@ tures and new details of the proposed hotel building provo@@ ked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Rober@@ to Schulz , property owner and member of the board of the residents &apos; lobby group , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , claims : &quot; It &apos;s going to be a huge development which lo@@ oms over all the other buildings &quot; .
Furthermore , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enor@@ m@@ ously due to the proposed size of the facility . &quot; We have to reck@@ on with whole bus@@ loads arriving , &quot; said Schulz .
However it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hec@@ t@@ are sized area of the former restaurant .
No operator has yet been identified .
&quot; First of all we have to present a coherent concept , &quot; says R@@ al@@ f B@@ ehr@@ ends .
Since this does not yet exist , construction plans are still subject to vari@@ ation .

Google laun@@ ches don@@ ation-@@ matching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( G@@ O@@ OG@@ L@@ .@@ O ) announced a don@@ ation-@@ matching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations ai@@ ding the thousands of refugees that have overwhel@@ med European nations as they fle@@ e war@@ -@@ tor@@ n and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google took an un@@ character@@ is@@ tically personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation drive on its blog .
Rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ ou@@ d , a Google employee who fl@@ ed Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
&quot; Our journey involved many dark train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and m@@ igrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
The donations will go toward four non@@ profit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cu@@ e Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.@@ 5 million worth of donations globally at goo@@ gle@@ .com / refuge@@ ere@@ lief until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four-@@ year-old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .

For mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e people with type 2 di@@ abetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
It &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e people with di@@ abetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ sur@@ gical treatments , however .
&quot; The mor@@ tali@@ ty data take a long time to show up , &quot; said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an edi@@ torial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
Wei@@ ght loss operations , or b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stom@@ ach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
Over the years , b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c sur@@ ger@@ ies have proved effective for treating type 2 di@@ abetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bi@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
A BM@@ I of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
You can calcul@@ ate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
For the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min@@ -S@@ hen@@ g General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial compar@@ ing two kinds of b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ yp@@ ass and sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 di@@ abetes in people who were mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e .
The average BM@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
Meanwhile , the BM@@ I among those receiving non-@@ sur@@ gical di@@ abetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
Among those who had surgery , di@@ abetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
In the medi@@ call@@ y-@@ treated group , by comparison , di@@ abetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
In addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ des , and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; was generally better in the sur@@ gical group , &quot; the authors found .
The researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
H@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After surgery , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better &quot; gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mor@@ tali@@ ty rate at five years , according to lead resear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h-@@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and colleagues .
The research team also compared average out@@ comes with the two types of surgery .
At the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger drop@@ s in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.@@ 1 ) and in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete di@@ abetes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent vs 16.@@ 7 percent ) .
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavi@@ er people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Ari@@ zona College of Medi@@ cin@@ e-@@ Phoen@@ ix .
In the Swedish study , o@@ bes@@ e people who had b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
Though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; This is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BM@@ I group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s BM@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into obe@@ sity and di@@ abetes , rever@@ sing that is really hard .

&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
The Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the UK .
He claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
He also stressed that , however admi@@ rable , the West@@ -European countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; It it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama pra@@ ised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphasi@@ zed .
Ul@@ tim@@ ately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We have to reduce the use of force .
The use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
Ad@@ dres@@ sing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also comm@@ ented on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US &quot; violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
After 9 / 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-@@ violence .
I know his mo@@ tives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .
Four@@ fold increase in children in@@ ge@@ sting hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er in last 4 years
Po@@ ison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400@@ -@@ percent up@@ tick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 s@@ wal@@ lowing high@@ ly-@@ alcoholi@@ c hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er , according to the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
According to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord L@@ op@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er in@@ gestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ ison control centers went up from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .
&quot; Ki@@ ds are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez told CN@@ N .
He said some kids are drinking san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er inten@@ tionally , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or on a soci@@ al-@@ media dare .
Videos on YouTube show teen@@ agers drinking san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er for a cheap bu@@ z@@ z .
Te@@ ens have re@@ porte@@ dly mixed san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er with alco@@ hol@@ -@@ containing mou@@ th@@ w@@ ash for a sti@@ ffer drink .
Yo@@ unger children can be drawn to attractive san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er sc@@ ents .
&quot; A k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez said .
A lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers ) are the ones that are s@@ cent@@ ed .
There are stra@@ w@@ berry , gra@@ pe , or@@ ange@@ -@@ fla@@ vo@@ red hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers that are very appealing to kids .
Hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
In young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; It &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison control center at University of K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , told Fox 4 in K@@ ans@@ as City .
So you w@@ ouldn &apos;t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consu@@ me a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six-@@ year-old girl who recently in@@ ge@@ sted as many as four squ@@ ir@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ ber@@ r@@ y-@@ s@@ cent@@ ed hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her bloo@@ d-@@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally dr@@ un@@ k in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
Doc@@ tors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; That was very sc@@ ary , &quot; Or@@ t@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CN@@ N .
It could have been very le@@ th@@ al for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alcoholi@@ c products or san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ing wi@@ pes short of moving hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er out of a child &apos;s reach .
Beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers have been linked to deaths .
In 2013 , two On@@ tari@@ o women died after s@@ wal@@ lowing hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ing@@ re@@ dient .
Health officials sur@@ mis@@ ed that the product contained me@@ than@@ ol , a dead@@ ly agent , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as the active ing@@ re@@ dient .
In January , three four@@ th-@@ grade students in up@@ state New York p@@ lot@@ ted to po@@ ison their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting anti@@ bac@@ ter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .
The teacher is highly all@@ ergi@@ c to hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er and banned it from her room .
Police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be &quot; id@@ le chat@@ ter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

There is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I &apos;ll turn things around , vo@@ ws D@@ ei@@ la
RO@@ N@@ N@@ Y D@@ ei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic are stru@@ ggling , but the Norwe@@ gian bo@@ ss vo@@ wed to turn things around .
De@@ fe@@ at to Mal@@ mo and subsequent Champ@@ ions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-@@ man Aber@@ de@@ en , who now sit five points clear at the top of the table .
But D@@ ei@@ la said : &quot; Cel@@ tic have had bad periods before and we will come again . &quot;
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very an@@ gr@@ y or sad about what is happening .
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
We really , really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players much better .
To stay together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton war@@ y of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago sugge@@ sting that he had identified some January transfer targets , Ran@@ gers bo@@ ss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is war@@ y of a signing spre@@ e , insi@@ sting he doesn &apos;t want to dis@@ rupt the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad &apos;s unity .
The ex-@@ Br@@ ent@@ ford g@@ aff@@ er said : &quot; The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
In terms of players coming in the summer , you have that pre-@@ season period to bed them in , which you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
The squ@@ ad is doing really well .
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target Mich@@ u in retirement hin@@ t

Sc@@ ots unemployment remains un@@ changed as UK total rises
UN@@ E@@ MP@@ LO@@ Y@@ M@@ ENT in Scotland remained un@@ changed at 16@@ 4@@ ,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the UK &apos;s rate of 5.@@ 5 per cent , the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) figures showed .
Meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three month period , with the number of those in work now standing at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
The employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 per cent .
Secretary of State for Scotland David M@@ und@@ ell , comm@@ enting on the latest figures , said : &quot; The government &apos;s long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
In those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling .

Why I &apos;m A Wit@@ ness At An Exec@@ ution In Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
Later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p is executed by le@@ th@@ al injection .
He has asked me to be one of four official witn@@ esses to his death .
The invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
As the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to dre@@ ad it .
So why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
Tru@@ e , journalists are permitted to watch exec@@ utions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lo@@ tter@@ y takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
W@@ ho@@ ever is picked will watch it disp@@ as@@ sion@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p &apos;s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours .
I like the guy .
We often lau@@ gh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed a note@@ book and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
One Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a journalist accused me on Twitter of com@@ promising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
Here &apos;s the lesson .
T@@ ell the in@@ m@@ ate &apos;s story the way he likes it , get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
She admitted that she &quot; could have phra@@ sed it better , &quot; but still thinks I &apos;m wrong to do what I &apos;m doing .
Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
He doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I w@@ ouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witn@@ esses at any time .
But he wants an international re@@ porter to be there to write about it .
If he dies , he thinks the publi@@ city will help the anti-@@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be alongside me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glo@@ ssi@@ p is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an access@@ ory after the fact .
But I believe there is a strong prob@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other re@@ por@@ ters you can turn to for that .
What you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
Man co@@ a@@ xed from Cann@@ ing River after so@@ gg@@ y police ch@@ ase

A Per@@ th man &apos;s bid to lose a police tail came und@@ one after he found himself in sh@@ allow , mu@@ d@@ dy water just metres from a police officer trying to &quot; co@@ ax him g@@ ently back to shore . &quot;
Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police were called to a tre@@ sp@@ ass@@ ing incident in B@@ eck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
When they spot@@ ted the suspect he tried to di@@ tch them by heading into the Cann@@ ing River .
But he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; He was standing in the water saying &apos; I &apos;m not getting out , &apos; come and get me &apos; , &quot; Senior Ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine said .
Con@@ stable L@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t too keen on getting his uniform wet , so he employed a safer tac@@ tic - &quot; good police negotiation . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy alleg@@ es ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y on him and threatens to qu@@ it racing
Peter Moo@@ dy has alleged Racing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to qu@@ it racing immediately .
He took aim at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , alleg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s positive s@@ wa@@ b to co@@ b@@ alt , which he can not explain .
He had bitten his tongue about the sp@@ y alleg@@ ations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like s@@ our gra@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so fru@@ str@@ ated it all comes out at once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
They know it went on .
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be a tra@@ iner .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
Ear@@ lier , Moo@@ dy had dropped the bom@@ b@@ shell in a rac@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y on his stable .
&quot; Ei@@ gh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Ba@@ i@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr Bri@@ an Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ables to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
They obviously believe I &apos;m a che@@ at .
If that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their brie@@ fs because they &apos;ve been in@@ competent in trying to catch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bern@@ ard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
Should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
Has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I that bad for the industry ?
Maybe people out there think I am .
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
But I &apos;ve got to the point now where I don &apos;t care and that s@@ ad@@ dens me .
That really s@@ ad@@ dens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I &apos;ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
The tra@@ iner &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built with the long-@@ running co@@ b@@ alt inquiry involving Li@@ dar@@ i and the late scrat@@ ching had him saying that he could &quot; throw my licence across the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for preparing unbe@@ aten champion Black C@@ avi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the ra@@ ce-@@ day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a mu@@ d or cla@@ y p@@ oul@@ tice had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
It &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
One of my staff mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly lac@@ ed mu@@ d on its leg .
It could have had it last night .
It could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
It had it on race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three-@@ month dis@@ qualification for the race day treatment using the p@@ oul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
It is a jo@@ ke .
People making these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y h@@ its back at ri@@ vals over w@@ rest@@ ling claims
Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the N@@ R@@ L &apos;s two premi@@ ership favou@@ rites .
Sydney Roo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson said the refer@@ ees allowed the Stor@@ m to &quot; w@@ rest@@ le &quot; his side during the Stor@@ m &apos;s up@@ set win in the quali@@ fying final in Sydney on Friday night .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos coach Wa@@ y@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a thin@@ ly vei@@ led reference to the Stor@@ m after his side &apos;s quali@@ fying final win over North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a &quot; show@@ case &quot; of the ru@@ g@@ by le@@ ague and said the two Que@@ ens@@ land weren &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ am@@ y defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
Bell@@ am@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ aches critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Stor@@ m be@@ ating them .
&quot; That keeps coming up - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson bring up w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24-@@ 2 , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our defen@@ sive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackl@@ es and that has been the turn around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
It &apos;s fun@@ ny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bell@@ am@@ y challeng@@ ed B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; remin@@ ding his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s St Geor@@ ge-@@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ g@@ ons won the premi@@ ership in 2010 by playing &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; football .
Wa@@ y@@ ne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
He made a point of compar@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and Wa@@ y@@ ne said he didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ar@@ se .
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
That &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
He made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like Anth@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like that .
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
Six weeks ago they probably weren &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out the Stor@@ m and Roo@@ sters game was a higher sc@@ oring contest than the Bron@@ cos and Co@@ w@@ boys game .
The Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t wat@@ ched it yet but what was the score ? 16-@@ 12 ?
Our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
Or is it making breaks and not sc@@ oring tries that is exciting ?
To me it &apos;s agen@@ das .
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
The Stor@@ m have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Que@@ ens@@ land Co@@ w@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks in next Saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k ba@@ il on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine that was smu@@ gg@@ led into Que@@ ens@@ land has been granted ba@@ il on a $ 200@@ ,000 su@@ rety .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tra@@ cked 100 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of the drug from the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and do@@ cked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed meeting with his co-@@ accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house caf@@ e , where police found 40 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of the drug in a To@@ y@@ ota Ech@@ o .
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the caf@@ e for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Ju@@ dge Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was a flight risk .
He has clear connections to Serbia .
He tra@@ vels to Serbia often , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
On the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic &apos;s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ rety of $ 200@@ ,000 to secure his release .
&quot; Having read the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the im@@ position of a su@@ rety of $ 200@@ ,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , &quot; Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan said .
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was granted ba@@ il on the conditions that he sur@@ render both his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sports , report to police on a daily basis and adher@@ es to a 6@@ p@@ m-@@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .

Ste@@ van Ho@@ gg used girls phone to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les to send images
A pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used an 11-@@ year-old girl &apos;s phone to so@@ lic@@ it child abuse images .
Ste@@ van Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as she sle@@ pt then log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service where he had a succ@@ ession of inde@@ cent images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Ho@@ gg &apos;s hand .
She looked through it and found the distur@@ bing messages before immediately al@@ er@@ ting her mother .
Police attended and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web sear@@ ches using terms for finding inde@@ cent image of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les &quot; on the internet before &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ding he was a police officer to sc@@ are them . &quot;
Fis@@ cal dep@@ ute E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ de@@ e Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; He said it was an addi@@ ction - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
He accepted the sear@@ ches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ tend to be a police officer to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les .
He was asked about his convers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
He said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rap@@ e and murder images .
Ms Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; When the girl found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was sha@@ king and cr@@ ying .
She saw the inde@@ cent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
The girl was inter@@ viewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , of W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty on indic@@ tment to charges of taking or making inde@@ cent images of children on June 14 last year , bre@@ aching ba@@ il on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
Defence so@@ lic@@ it@@ or Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg not be placed on the sex offen@@ ders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .

The chas@@ sis makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IA@@ A
In 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
Comp@@ act class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport ( K@@ BA ) about 28@@ .@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations in August alone belon@@ ged to this segment .
This is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
In among all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and the new high-@@ end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
One of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car sector here is the Op@@ el A@@ stra , which h@@ its the car deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; The A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Op@@ el bo@@ ss Kar@@ l-@@ Thomas Ne@@ um@@ ann at the show .
It is at the heart of the brand .
To ensure that it s@@ ells well , the price of the new A@@ stra is not increasing significantly .
Op@@ el proposes an entry point below that of its main competi@@ tor , the V@@ W Golf , which starts at € 17@@ ,@@ 650 .
The latest A@@ stra costs from € 16@@ ,@@ 9@@ 90 .
With a new 1.4 li@@ tre engine , the A@@ stra has an output of 74 k@@ w / 100 h@@ p .
The H@@ es@@ sian manufacturer also offers diesel and pet@@ rol engines from 70 k@@ w / 95 h@@ p to 14@@ 7 k@@ w / 200 h@@ p , including the first three cy@@ linder pet@@ rol model .
Unlike its most important competitors , V@@ W Golf and Ford Focus , for the first time the Op@@ el A@@ stra is only available as a five door .
In spring the estate car , already seen at the IA@@ A , will follow as the second option
And what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competi@@ tor to the A@@ stra , the Mé@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
The Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-@@ door , in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly spor@@ ty version .
It will be available in deal@@ er@@ ships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in this segment .
The N@@ iss@@ an off@@ shoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
The compact Infin@@ iti , with its cur@@ ved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
The basic model will have a pet@@ rol engine with a performance of at least 90 k@@ w / 12@@ 2 h@@ p .
A diesel with 80 k@@ w / 10@@ 9 h@@ p or 125 k@@ w / 170 h@@ p is also on offer .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : also new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celeb@@ rates its world premi@@ ere in Frankfurt .
On offer is the pet@@ rol engine model , including a newly developed 1.0 li@@ tre tur@@ bo engine and a performance of 82 k@@ w / 111 h@@ p .
According to the man@@ fac@@ tur@@ er &apos;s specifications , the maximum tor@@ que is 170 New@@ ton metres ( N@@ m ) .
The Bal@@ eno is launched in Europe in early 20@@ 16 .
DS@@ 4 : not totally new , but completely re@@ designed , is the DS 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
The designers at the class@@ y Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n off@@ shoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radi@@ ator gri@@ lle has been newly designed and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with LED technology .
In the interior the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system in particular has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play has been incorporated .
In the compact class the IA@@ A also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Merce@@ des A Class or the P@@ eu@@ ge@@ ot 30@@ 8 .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ met@@ re cells are un@@ fit for human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court has up@@ held a complaint by a former in@@ m@@ ate of Te@@ gel prison that he had been hou@@ sed for months in too small a cell .
In principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
The Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday .
According to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( re@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 12@@ 7 / 14 ) .
For this reason a former prison@@ er was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . He was de@@ tained in Berlin Te@@ gel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres : the toilet was not in a separate room .
After@@ wards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was transferred to a larger cell .
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of un@@ suitable prison conditions however , failed .
But the constitutional judges set aside the jud@@ gement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and re@@ submitted the case there for renewed assessment .
In their view the human dignity of the man had been violated .
The Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages .
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in cu@@ sto@@ dy are significant for compensation , enti@@ t@@ lement to a claim for compensation exists .
Otherwise there would be &quot; fears of deterioration of a person &apos;s right to protection &quot; .
The Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pec@@ uni@@ ary compensation .
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
As recently as April they awarded damages to a prison@@ er because he had been locked in his cell n@@ aked .
A cell with multiple functions and without a separate toilet is also in@@ humane , according to a decision from 2011 .
Furthermore Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prison@@ er in a parallel case in November 2009 had at@@ tested to in@@ humane accommodation
The prison@@ er at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karlsruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
Because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness rises and it has even led to bra@@ w@@ ls due to the ten@@ se situation .
According to information from the press office of the public prosec@@ utor , 21 positions in Te@@ gel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will cease to exist in 20@@ 16 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; We can handle it &quot;
The influ@@ x of refugees is an enormous challenge – the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What changes will we see in Germany ?
According to the predic@@ tions of the Federal Minister of the Inter@@ ior , around 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el ( SP@@ D ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . &quot; I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it &quot; .
The following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
According to various forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation by the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) homes will be needed annually – and in fact for the next five years .
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 25@@ 0@@ ,000 homes ) .
The lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : between 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social d@@ well@@ ings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
Federal building minister Bar@@ bara H@@ end@@ ri@@ cks ( SP@@ D ) thus wants to double funding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
In the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute this is far too little : 80@@ ,000 social d@@ well@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
Aca@@ dem@@ ics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
However the refugees in Germany are not being systematically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started , criticised Clau@@ dia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann Foundation .
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self-@@ este@@ em of the imm@@ igrant says migration resear@@ cher Di@@ et@@ rich Th@@ rän@@ hardt .
According to Th@@ rän@@ hardt , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
While in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of dom@@ ici@@ le .
As far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
One big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work@@ -@@ related language courses .
Studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
Thus , in Th@@ rän@@ hardt &apos;s view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
The Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kinder@@ garten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . &quot; For the u@@ pro@@ oted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spo@@ kes@@ man for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Sen@@ ate administration .
To be able to convince families of the benefits of kinder@@ gar@@ tens , the administration is issuing le@@ af@@ lets in a number of languages .
If the need for teachers increases shar@@ ply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Sen@@ ate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical col@@ leg@@ es .
In the states , pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
There is no shortage of these , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying – the only exception up to now was Berlin : Sen@@ ator for the Inter@@ ior Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has however now abandoned his stance .
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es who want to study may have their entrance to university facilit@@ ated .
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es with a residence permit or protection against de@@ port@@ ation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
In principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
Toler@@ ated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 20@@ 16 this period is reduced to 15 months .
But this financing gap must also be closed , claim Ste@@ ffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
The students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-@@ church law should be developed into a state-@@ religion relationship .
The founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arri@@ vals in a professional manner , is also important .
Rights also involve responsibilities .
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to conc@@ ede certain control options .
This also requires the read@@ iness to act coura@@ ge@@ ously against religious fundament@@ alism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
Those who want to wage such conflict in Germany &quot; have immediately for@@ fei@@ ted their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said on Bavarian radio .
He suggested transl@@ ating this basic law into Arab@@ ic .
In the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
This means too that main@@ stream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
For nearly 10 years , as a result of European rul@@ ings , Germany has had an anti-@@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
But it is learning very slowly , as the N@@ S@@ U murder series shows , that rac@@ ist mo@@ tives are systematically ignored in the police and the authorities .
Equ@@ al opportunities for all : what m@@ igrant organisations and non-@@ white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international treaties such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens – for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doc@@ tors &apos; Association , Frank Ul@@ rich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; As far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we can cope , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel .
However extra money must be added to the system for this .
In order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asked for all new arri@@ vals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
Services provided can be accoun@@ ted for with the Federal states later .
And in the long term it is highly doub@@ tful that so many people can be f@@ ob@@ bed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Ben@@ ef@@ its for Asyl@@ um Se@@ ek@@ ers Act provides .
Apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier .
Up to now , as Berlin health resear@@ cher The@@ a Bor@@ de has established , migrants have received poorer information about their ill@@ nesses than other patients .
Interpre@@ ters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors &apos; practices , she demands .
But many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine drop@@ -in centres in emergency rooms .
And with a different diagno@@ stic view .
Re@@ fu@@ gee children for example clearly suffer from more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery
&quot; Para@@ site infec@@ tions or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not that difficult to recognise . &quot; And because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
To be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exam@@ s .
In the estim@@ ation of the Federal Psy@@ cho@@ therapeutic Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are ment@@ ally ill : most of them are suffering from post-@@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order or depression .
Re@@ fu@@ gee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
A so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be published study by the TU in Munich documents that every fifth Syri@@ an refugee child arri@@ ves trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
Those who suffer from post-@@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order suffer among other things from so-called f@@ las@@ h@@ backs , difficulties in brea@@ thing , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration dis@@ orders , ner@@ v@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
In order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
Up to now , however , only four percent of ment@@ ally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
Ment@@ ally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
In addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological ill@@ nesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This frequently leads to false assessments , says Mun@@ z .
The ring invites you to dream
With their new &quot; Pas@@ sion &quot; production , Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st is returning to the traditions of the art of the cir@@ cus .
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mes@@ mer@@ ising acro@@ b@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
Now Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Zie@@ gel@@ w@@ asen .
&quot; Our passion is our cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ st , animal tra@@ iner and junior manager .
&quot; Pas@@ sion &quot; - this is the motto for the current production in the ring .
The cir@@ cus has been owned by the Pro@@ b@@ st family for over 33 years .
The family has the gift of enth@@ r@@ alling people in their blood .
&quot; It &apos;s important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old junior manager .
Director Rein@@ hard Pro@@ b@@ st calls his concept a &quot; Cock@@ tail in the ring with a cosmo@@ politan fla@@ ir &quot; .
Fif@@ ty towns have the chance to experience this fla@@ ir on the almost 3000 kilomet@@ re-@@ long tour .
The cir@@ cus programme wins people over with tal@@ ented artists from all over the world .
Di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ished at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v clo@@ wn family cap@@ tiv@@ ate the public with wi@@ t and charm .
The Cas@@ ti@@ llo brothers , too , know their craft .
The Cuban du@@ o are ready to compete with the her@@ oes of silent films .
Ligh@@ tness and agi@@ lity - these words sum them up .
Their hum@@ or@@ ous arti@@ stry on the p@@ ole will win the women &apos;s hearts .
Apart from causing numerous bur@@ sts of lau@@ ghter , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ st &apos;s acro@@ b@@ ats are also mes@@ mer@@ ising with their fin@@ esse and sup@@ pl@@ eness .

&quot; The animals belong to our family , &quot; insi@@ sts St@@ ap@@ han@@ ie &apos;s mother , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Pro@@ b@@ st .
Differ@@ ent animal welfare organisations all too often compla@@ in about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of cir@@ cus animals .
Steph@@ an@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ st has her own answer to this : &quot; If our animals aren &apos;t happy , then nor are we &quot; .
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every bit of attention .
The &quot; four-@@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; as they are affec@@ tion@@ ately known , have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible .
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go in the ring either .
So the top priority is to look after the animals well .
The Pro@@ b@@ st family are especially proud of their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id , J@@ umb@@ o - the off@@ spring of a Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony stal@@ lion and a z@@ eb@@ ra mare .
The two animals lived together in one en@@ closure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; Then suddenly there was our little J@@ umb@@ o , &quot; says Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Pro@@ b@@ st .
But the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , instead he is a unique little mas@@ co@@ t for the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st .
There is something for every visitor .
&quot; One thing is for certain , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ st , &quot; regardless of whether there are five or 1,@@ 200 people in the audience , we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts .
Cir@@ cus Pro@@ b@@ st invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
The programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
Thursday is family day ; there is a discount on the price of the show .
And the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ dium .
He was un@@ hur@@ t , but video of the fall went vi@@ ral on social media .
The opening of parliament was also tar@@ nis@@ hed by claims by opposition legislat@@ ors that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
Last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ kl@@ ed him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
Mo@@ vement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) chief whi@@ p In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to dis@@ rupt N@@ r Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s ti@@ tled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
It war@@ ns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
The chief whi@@ p said the party , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ wle@@ tt@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard to cut up to 30@@ ,000 jobs
He@@ wle@@ tt@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard expects to cut 25@@ ,000 to 30@@ ,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-@@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is sp@@ lit@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and printer businesses from its fast@@ er-@@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
As a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evol@@ ving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard Enterprise will have more than $ 50@@ bn in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930@@ s by Stan@@ ford University gradu@@ ates Bill He@@ wle@@ tt and Da@@ ve Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to garage has been du@@ b@@ bed &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has been under@@ going a massive re@@ organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
The move by HP , the world &apos;s second-@@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
Ar@@ senal cap@@ tain Mi@@ kel Ar@@ te@@ ta says te@@ am-@@ m@@ ates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of D@@ in@@ amo Zagreb tie
W@@ enger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
That best-@@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s European Championship is clearly uncertain .
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate ank@@ le injury and then looked back to his old shar@@ p@@ ness during pre-@@ season .
&quot; This kind of injury is not care@@ er-@@ threatening , &quot; said W@@ enger .
It is a bone that did not he@@ al well .
It is nothing major .
This was just an accident .
It was not linked with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the inj@@ uries he had before .
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as W@@ enger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further inj@@ uries whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
There is also an un@@ comfortable pattern developing .
Research by Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his de@@ but six years ago .
He has also played in only 65 of Ar@@ senal &apos;s 15@@ 7 le@@ ague games during the last five seasons .
The wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-@@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Ar@@ senal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
&quot; Sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
With Ar@@ senal beginning their Champ@@ ions League campaign on Wednesday night against D@@ in@@ amo Zagreb ahead of matches with Ch@@ el@@ sea on Saturday and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , W@@ enger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aar@@ on Ram@@ sey have not trav@@ elled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u De@@ buch@@ y and Ar@@ te@@ ta are likely to start .
W@@ enger may also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d in place of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Although Ar@@ senal are clear favou@@ rites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe &apos;s most intim@@ id@@ ating .
D@@ in@@ amo are also unbe@@ aten in 41 matches after producing their own &quot; Inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign last season .
The stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night by an earth tre@@ m@@ or that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
W@@ enger believes that Ar@@ senal have learnt the lesson of last season &apos;s Champ@@ ions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup tri@@ umph .
&quot; This drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
It has never been done at Ar@@ senal .
We were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
We are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is g@@ lar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desper@@ ate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young m@@ ales at 15 year high .
In 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-@@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in m@@ ales than fem@@ ales .
In a bid to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( C@@ AL@@ M ) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Fri@@ end@@ ship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2@@ ,000 high-@@ school students displa@@ ying de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of recover@@ ing doub@@ led .
Equ@@ ally , for those not de@@ pressed , a circle of ment@@ ally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
But of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
In this age of soci@@ al-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often priori@@ ti@@ sed over meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doub@@ led the need to appear strong , fun@@ -@@ lo@@ ving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
This super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists term ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply imp@@ acts our mental health .
And as a billi@@ on@@ aire vide@@ o-@@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater happiness .
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
Each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their person@@ alities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
The hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and C@@ hand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ro@@ ss &apos;s p@@ ining for R@@ ach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
As a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : .... &quot; my listening role to people feeling de@@ pressed and suici@@ dal has really highlighted how even the smallest inter@@ actions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
The old ad@@ age of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
As much as my objective , out@@ si@@ der status over the phone helps people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
And so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central &apos;s Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
Or , better still , if in Star@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a s@@ mile and say h@@ ello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends is broadcasting on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 23@@ 6 ep@@ iso@@ des - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
Di Maria scores to help PS@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
An@@ gel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after sc@@ oring against Mal@@ mo .
An@@ gel Di Maria sco@@ red on his Champ@@ ions League de@@ but to help PS@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
Here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
An@@ gel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Saint-@@ Ger@@ main began their Champ@@ ions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-@@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Parc des Prin@@ ces on Tuesday .
Di Maria sco@@ red less than four minutes into his Champ@@ ions League de@@ but as a PS@@ G player to set the French champ@@ ions on their way , but they missed a succ@@ ession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
With Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ ar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champ@@ ions as they target not just qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ tage display by Lau@@ rent Blan@@ c &apos;s side with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic wa@@ ste@@ ful in front of goal and later being sub@@ stituted against his hom@@ et@@ own team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champ@@ ions League , so to win 2-@@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &quot; said Blan@@ c .
It au@@ g@@ urs well .
We wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-@@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ deaux in Lig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ st@@ aged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
The Argentina w@@ inger was lab@@ elled as the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ i &apos;s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
However , if anyone then expected PS@@ G to rom@@ p to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Cel@@ tic in a pla@@ y-@@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at ki@@ ck-@@ off and , with a five-@@ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
But , save for a Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that sli@@ d just wide of Kev@@ in Tra@@ pp &apos;s far post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PS@@ G let themselves down at times with some wa@@ ste@@ ful passing and poor finishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the re@@ start .
Nevertheless , he proved much more ade@@ pt when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic pass that Di Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had fli@@ cked on a left-@@ wing cross from Max@@ well .
That ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by Wil@@ and from poin@@ t-@@ blan@@ k range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach Age H@@ are@@ ide later admitted PS@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwe@@ gian saying : &quot; Our last Champ@@ ions League game was in December last year . &quot;
Since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague which is not the same level .
The quali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .
H@@ ats off to Paris .
It was a magnificent match from them .

X@@ av@@ i : P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion X@@ av@@ i has played for the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club in Q@@ atar since summer 2015 .
A few years ago , FC Bayern was apparently close to commit@@ ting to Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
Ei@@ ght times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champ@@ ions League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - X@@ av@@ i &apos;s list of titles is breath@@ -@@ taking .
In the summer the then 3@@ 5-@@ year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Q@@ atar and the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club .
But in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
&quot; I was told that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; At the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren &apos;t , &quot; he says .
And FC Bayern noticed that too .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; There was an offer from Bayern . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
A quick remin@@ der : in the summer of 2008 , Jür@@ gen Klin@@ s@@ mann took over at FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not transfer .
The transfer never happened .
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion : P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why . &quot; Bar@@ ça had signed on Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a brilliant European Championship . &quot;
&quot; Pep@@ e told me that I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t transfer , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; He got me with that . &quot;
Who knows how Bayern &apos;s 2008 / 2009 season would have turned out if X@@ av@@ i had left .
X@@ av@@ i covered the entire distance on the tur@@ f for Bar@@ ça in the quarter final of the Champ@@ ions League against Bayern , kno@@ cked the Re@@ ds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the premi@@ ere class tri@@ umph .
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in film@@ making
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confronted Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
During Sunday night &apos;s episode of H@@ B@@ O &apos;s Project Green@@ light , the seas@@ oned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasi@@ zing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black pro@@ tagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play .
&quot; When we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on asser@@ ted .
Sho@@ cked , Brown re@@ acted with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief , letting out &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wo@@ w . Ok@@ ay , &quot; as The Mar@@ tian actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would urge people to think about -- wh@@ o@@ ever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown initially said .
The only black character who &apos;s a ho@@ ok@@ er who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
The De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ tor@@ ted their direc@@ ting could &quot; end up giving us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
After the discussion ai@@ red , social media explo@@ ded in dis@@ approval over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the cli@@ p writing , &quot; Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is S@@ O W@@ H@@ ITE it hur@@ ts . &quot;
The t@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4@@ ,000 likes since being posted .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time where accurate ra@@ cial representation in media is at the fore@@ front of social discussion .
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement took nation@@ wide effect , ur@@ ging law@@ makers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
In February , singer Prince all@@ u@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nom@@ ine@@ es of Album of the Year at the Gra@@ m@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums still matter , &quot; he said .
Like books and black lives , alb@@ ums still matter .
More recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisa@@ beth Has@@ sel@@ beck &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a h@@ ate group .
&quot; The Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gul@@ s invited to visit the P@@ ope to discuss the Catholic Church &apos;s portra@@ yal in the West .
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the P@@ ope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; cro@@ wns first champion
Pro-@@ rock clim@@ ber and bus@@ boy Isa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athle@@ te to win American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
The competition show , which just wra@@ pped up its 7th season , has never seen any competi@@ tor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
During the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , made it to the final round .
The final task involved climbing a 7@@ 5-@@ foot rop@@ e in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first-@@ ever athle@@ te to complete American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos;s gru@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about , like I &apos;ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , &quot; Isa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pa@@ y-@@ b@@ ump .
So to all of a sudden ... like I can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ ale and why , despite B@@ ritten being the first ever competi@@ tor to finish the course , won &apos;t be awarded any prize money .
By the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; If there &apos;s more than one fin@@ is@@ her , the one with the fastest time gets it , &quot; said We@@ ed .
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he har@@ b@@ ors any ill will about it .
He &apos;s just so happy to have done what he &apos;s done .
He &apos;s received tons of acc@@ ol@@ ades from fans .
He &apos;s such a great guy , and a family man .
He &apos;s a her@@ o to his kids and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I was going to be beat by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isa@@ ac . &quot;
And I think Isa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were rever@@ sed .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was renewed for an eigh@@ th season , which will begin fil@@ ming in Spring 20@@ 16 .
Det@@ ro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS -- The second half the season has@@ n &apos;t been a lot of fun for the Det@@ ro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers .
Once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , the T@@ ig@@ ers are now in last place in the American League Central .
Re@@ duc@@ ing to being a spo@@ iler , the T@@ ig@@ ers played the part perfectly Tuesday , be@@ ating the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins 5-@@ 4 at Tar@@ get Fiel@@ d .
The T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to climb to within one-@@ half game of the Hou@@ ston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wil@@ d-@@ card spot .
For Det@@ ro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three-@@ letter F-@@ word that has been so el@@ u@@ sive over much of the season &apos;s second half .
&quot; All wins are fun , no matter how it happens , &quot; T@@ ig@@ ers manager Bra@@ d Aus@@ mus said .
T@@ ig@@ ers pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Det@@ ro@@ it sco@@ red three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then tack@@ ed one in the sixth and one more in the n@@ in@@ th .
Simon ( 13@@ -@@ 9 ) pit@@ ched 6 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three runs .
It was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
&quot; I just want to finish strong this year , &quot; Simon said .
It &apos;s hard for the bul@@ l@@ pen to throw every game , and that &apos;s why I want to go deep into the game .
T@@ ig@@ ers designated hit@@ ter Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three h@@ its and dro@@ ve in two runs , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid-@@ August .
It was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three-@@ hit night since he had four h@@ its against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; He sw@@ ung the bat well , &quot; Aus@@ mus said .
He looked good in ( bat@@ ting practice ) , looked notic@@ e@@ ably better in B@@ P , and he carried it right into the game .
Tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the sevent@@ h inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
Right fiel@@ der Aar@@ on Hi@@ cks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Simon got second bas@@ em@@ an Bri@@ an Do@@ zi@@ er to strike out sw@@ ing@@ ing before being li@@ fted for left-@@ han@@ der Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy wal@@ ked Mauer , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie designated hit@@ ter Miguel S@@ ano , who ri@@ pped a two-@@ run single to left off right-@@ han@@ der Dre@@ w Ver@@ Ha@@ gen .
With a pair of run@@ ners on and the t@@ ying run at second , Ver@@ Ha@@ gen got third bas@@ em@@ an Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to ground into a double play .
It was the maj@@ or-@@ le@@ agu@@ e-@@ leading 27@@ th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit into a DP .
After Det@@ ro@@ it tack@@ ed on an insurance run in the top of the n@@ in@@ th , Mauer ri@@ pped an R@@ B@@ I double to the gap against T@@ ig@@ ers closer Bru@@ ce Ron@@ don to make it 5-@@ 4 .
However , the right-@@ han@@ der struck out S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Det@@ ro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ sty Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es in the early going .
The T@@ ig@@ ers posted three runs in the first two inn@@ ings against the veter@@ an right-@@ han@@ der , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back infl@@ amm@@ ation .
&quot; Obviously not the start I &apos;d like to have , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
After getting the le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave up a single to second bas@@ em@@ an I@@ an K@@ ins@@ ler .
A two-@@ out walk to right fiel@@ der J@@ .@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who sing@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z sn@@ apped his 0-@@ for@@ -@@ 21 stre@@ ak with run@@ ners in sc@@ oring position .
Third bas@@ em@@ an N@@ ick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single to right , sc@@ oring another run , but Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
The T@@ ig@@ ers added on in the second , getting a one-@@ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ Can@@ n and a two-@@ out single by center fiel@@ der Anth@@ ony Go@@ se to make it 3-@@ 0 .
&quot; That was a big hit , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor said .
He didn &apos;t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es , who was on a pit@@ ch count , pit@@ ched a sco@@ reless third inning before being replaced by right-@@ handed relie@@ ver A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was charged with three runs on six h@@ its and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
N@@ OT@@ ES : T@@ ig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was shut down with a stra@@ in in his thro@@ wing shoulder .
He will be examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed surgery on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder back in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the disabled list with a shoulder stra@@ in since mid-@@ August , was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start .
With San@@ che@@ z out , L@@ HP Daniel Nor@@ ris will come off the D@@ L to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris is 1-@@ 1 in four starts with the T@@ ig@@ ers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .
He has been out since Aug@@ . 20 with a stra@@ ined right obli@@ que .
The T@@ ig@@ ers and T@@ wins will wra@@ p up their three-@@ game series at Tar@@ get Fiel@@ d on Wednesday .
Nor@@ ris ( 2-@@ 2 , 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will oppose M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5-@@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ER@@ A ) .
H@@ und@@ reds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wies@@ baden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
They are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
The people who have trav@@ elled there will then be hou@@ sed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wies@@ baden , according to a statement made by the city of Wies@@ baden on Tuesday evening .
They estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
A number of sports halls in the H@@ es@@ sian capital have been prepared for this eventu@@ ality over the last few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these .
After this they should be re@@ distributed to other communities .
According to a statement by the regional council of Gi@@ essen , responsible for their initial reception , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse in the past ten days alone
Due to the large number of refugees , emergency shel@@ ter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Han@@ au .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
&quot; I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
He accused the European nations of &quot; collec@@ tively looking the other way &quot; .
Four years ago one would have been happy for the ch@@ ali@@ ce of military involvement to pass Germany by .
&quot; Now the conflict has come cra@@ shing down at our front door , &quot; he said on the German World Service .
The former German Amb@@ assador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Inter@@ ior Minister , Johann@@ a Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner , stated on the Austrian television channel OR@@ F on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary .
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; No , that is the agreement , &quot; she confirmed .
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
Over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route .
Most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner Fa@@ y@@ mann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
On Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
At a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory re@@ distribution of a further 120@@ ,000 refugees .
In view of the heavy influ@@ x of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people .
The Federal government will manage this jointly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
But those who have no prospects of permanent re@@ sidency will not be able to stay in Germany .
This opinion is also clearly generally shared .
The Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a &quot; huge effort &quot; .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of desper@@ ate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route .
On Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia .
A few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to seal off the border with Romania with a f@@ ence .
Unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent people smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to about the planned new border f@@ ences .
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
The first arre@@ sts of people who had bre@@ ached the f@@ ence have taken place .
In Turkey mean@@ while , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders .
&quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; space probe finds ocean on Satur@@ n &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
Under the ic@@ y cr@@ ust of Satur@@ n &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ las@@ hes a global ocean .
Scienti@@ sts have de@@ duced this from ob@@ serving the &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; space probe
This is the reason the moon w@@ ob@@ bles slightly in its or@@ bit of the ring@@ ed planet .
This w@@ ob@@ b@@ ling is only minor , but nevertheless too much for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ ica in the US state of New York .
The scientists have published their findings in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; scientific journ@@ al .
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &apos;s cr@@ ust of ice .
&quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes , which spe@@ w water v@@ ap@@ our and ice partic@@ les that feed the so-called E ring of Satur@@ n , at the south p@@ ole of this moon in 2006 .
Ast@@ onom@@ ers concluded at the time that there had to be a sub@@ surface sea at least at the south p@@ ole .
The extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama ab@@ sent from 18@@ 60 Munich for several weeks
18@@ 60 Munich must do without att@@ acking mid@@ fiel@@ der Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
An examination revealed that the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old has suffered an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined of pain at the beginning of the week .
According to the Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis means &quot; probably a four week compulsory break &quot; .
&quot; It &apos;s hit us hard . R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; We have to think about it of course , &quot; Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club .
However the next training guest the sex@@ agen@@ arian is due to present is a def@@ ender .
Thir@@ ty-@@ year-old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg .
At the moment the Croatian has &quot; the opportunity to prove himself &quot; .
Following his conc@@ us@@ sion , goal sc@@ orer Rub@@ in O@@ ko@@ tie is returning to training with the team in the coming week .
The Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday .
O@@ ko@@ tie sustained a head injury in a violent col@@ li@@ sion in the match with Fort@@ una D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to initial fears , however , the wo@@ und was not serious .
Not a diet fruit – man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ goes are exotic , ju@@ ic@@ y and sweet .
But anybody watching their wa@@ ist@@ line should avoid them .
Because man@@ goes have a relatively high sugar content – primarily su@@ cro@@ se .
The exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : they contain B vit@@ am@@ ins as well as vit@@ am@@ ins E and C. But most of all man@@ goes are full of vit@@ amin A and its pre@@ cur@@ sor , be@@ ta-@@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
E@@ ating the fruit boo@@ sts the sight , immune system and the body &apos;s met@@ abo@@ lic processes .
When buying man@@ goes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant arom@@ a .
It is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ri@@ pe the fruit is – even green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
They should be kept at room temperature and consum@@ ed within a few days .
They are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes .
A man@@ go also gives a special touch even to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
They mitig@@ ate the slightly bitter taste of some lea@@ f sal@@ ads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ chio .

The company has already started to recru@@ it seasonal workers , UPS reported on Tuesday .
We are lo@@ oo@@ king for drivers in particular .
In the past few years , UPS increased its workforce by 9,@@ 500 for the four day season .
In light of bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ E@@ x have for several years been making provisions earlier in order to be prepared for Christmas business .
In 2013 there was harsh criticism of late deliveries by the par@@ cel service .

The fo@@ eh@@ n will blow through the Fo@@ eh@@ n V@@ alleys on Wednesday , continuing through the night , sometimes at g@@ ale force .
Once the fo@@ eh@@ n has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , gu@@ sty winds and a drop in temperature .
According to Me@@ te@@ o@@ News , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Is@@ les in a strong sou@@ th@@ western flow .
The fo@@ eh@@ n will break through the valleys on the northern sides of the Alps during Tuesday night .
The fo@@ eh@@ n will then blow through the Fo@@ eh@@ n V@@ alleys until Thursday morning with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h ; occasionally , and particularly in the c@@ anton of Ur@@ i , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .

Rome now has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square
Some 500 years after the Re@@ formation , Rome now has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square .
In the presence of the Mayor of the City , Ign@@ a@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hi@@ therto un@@ named square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was on Wednesday be@@ sto@@ wed with the name of the German re@@ former .
On the &quot; Piazza Martin L@@ ut@@ re@@ o &quot; he is now recognised as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Re@@ formation &quot; .
The park is in the centre of Rome right next to the Colo@@ sse@@ um
The con@@ sortium of Evange@@ lical churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
J@@ ens@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the Evange@@ lical Lu@@ ther@@ an community in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that for centuries Prote@@ stants in the P@@ ope &apos;s city often had to hide their faith .
The square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
As a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
At the time he considered the city to be a de@@ generate hot@@ bed of vice .
According to hist@@ ori@@ ans , his negative impres@@ sions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther her@@ al@@ ded the beginning of the Western Church with his th@@ eses against the selling of indul@@ gen@@ ces .
Tal@@ ented artist inv@@ ests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the ( g@@ il@@ ded ) cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Al@@ t has painted for his Bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bi@@ ble .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Bi@@ ble , which has now been issued with magnificent pictures .
For Ot@@ mar Al@@ t , who has dev@@ ised his own personal interpretation of bi@@ b@@ lical stories in 150 moti@@ fs on paper and can@@ vas , in the beginning was the picture .
The 7@@ 5-@@ year-old conceived his &quot; language &quot; with bright colours and imagin@@ ative forms - which are however by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; fun@@ ny &quot; pictures .
On the contrary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thoroughly glo@@ om@@ y .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t worked on his Bi@@ ble project for around three years and for this project he made a subjec@@ tive choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the &quot; Book of books &quot; .
Cy@@ cles evol@@ ved , dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross , pla@@ gues , the Comm@@ and@@ ments or the Lord &apos;s Pra@@ yer .
Without even approaching them , he immediately att@@ acted multiple partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag , a publi@@ sher speciali@@ sing in the@@ ological works as well as the K@@ ett@@ ler Verlag , who focus on publishing art books .
And in particular author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has gra@@ p@@ pled with the particular Bi@@ ble pass@@ ages based on the paintings .
He has interpreted the Bi@@ ble texts selected by Ot@@ mar Al@@ t and &quot; translated &quot; them to the current day , in a topical context .
These texts are like verb@@ al mir@@ rors of Al@@ t &apos;s paintings .
They are embedded between the original Bi@@ ble quot@@ ations of Martin Lu@@ ther and each composition by the artist , who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations .
The decorated cover of the book is let@@ tered in gold .
The 7@@ 5-@@ year-old allows at the same time a tw@@ o@@ fold insight , deep into both his soul and his emotions .
This is particularly intimate .
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , his emotions were the key trigger for the Bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Al@@ t , who was born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Prote@@ stant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ ut order .
&quot; Education there took place under the shadow of the cane &quot; , re@@ members Ot@@ mar Al@@ t .
&quot; I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : &quot; The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
Sy@@ mbo@@ li@@ sm has been driven out .
Arti@@ sts have a different passion and joy in presenting things .
Pic@@ tures always have something mysteri@@ ous about them ; they are not decoration .
&quot; In this respect , I am a din@@ o@@ sau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t wants his vie@@ wers to let themselves &quot; fall into &quot; the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : &quot; The picture is looking for its counter@@ part &quot; .
At the launch of the Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Bi@@ ble on Tuesday , Klaus Al@@ te@@ post conf@@ essed to having &quot; always &quot; been a lo@@ ver of Ot@@ mar Al@@ t &apos;s art : &quot; I like the way he sees life with his pictures &quot; .
Al@@ t was not interested in recording the whole of the Bi@@ ble , selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysteri@@ ous .
&quot; This wasn &apos;t a collaboration between partners , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post , &quot; it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . &quot; The result is a picture Bi@@ ble .
For Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of the Lu@@ ther Verlag this work is an invitation &quot; to add depth to his life and to find freedom &quot; .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t &apos;s pictures speak , for Mö@@ h@@ ler , the ( bi@@ b@@ lical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
Some of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ vas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Foundation .
Start of construction draws closer for BM@@ X track
Plans made , site found , company commissioned , mo@@ und for a circuit mod@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was closed again .
Political and administrative fail@@ ings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
So the mo@@ und was demo@@ li@@ shed and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
Appro@@ val will be received in October , chief local coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ b@@ ach@@ -@@ Bo@@ ch has now been able to inform the children &apos;s and young people &apos;s committee .
&quot; I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , &quot; she said .
The work should then be started without any &quot; further pause for thought &quot; at the site of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B steps up its commitment to refugees
The German football le@@ ague gave clear indications at the weekend that the DF@@ B is extending its commitment to refugees to 20@@ 19 .
Foot@@ ball has re@@ acted to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; Basi@@ cally nobody knows , it &apos;s no concern of mine , it &apos;s not my doing . &quot;
&quot; It is in the interests of everybody to get to gri@@ p with this issue , &quot; says DF@@ B chief Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I &apos;m going to be in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and I &apos;m meeting there with State Minister Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure the topic will play a central role there , &quot; he announ@@ ces .
Foot@@ ball can and will help .
But the politicians must set the deciding guidelines .
The German Foot@@ ball Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; Through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us@@ -B@@ rau@@ n foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 20@@ 19 , &quot; declared N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the U@@ EFA meeting in St Ju@@ lian &apos;s , Malta
Several teams are also supporting the programme .
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words &quot; We are helping – # refuge@@ es@@ welcome &quot; on the left sle@@ eve of their strip instead of the usual spon@@ sor &apos;s logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , &quot; L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sport bo@@ ss Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper on Tuesday , and describes the scheme as &quot; a matter of course &quot; .
&quot; The refugee drama concerns everyone , nobody can look away . &quot;
&quot; We football teams can , no , we must use our char@@ is@@ ma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , &quot; says Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ en@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a prominent signal by the le@@ ague .
The women &apos;s national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle ( Sa@@ ale ) for the World Cup quali@@ fying match against Hungary .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach describes supporting the refugees as &quot; a grand joint effort by German football . &quot;
It is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
The message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; that we have sent out is being lived in football .
&quot; That is of enormous significance , &quot; he said .
In both this year and next year the association together with the DF@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 300@@ ,000 available for the integration of refugees .
&quot; The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; reports N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
Re@@ ports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
According to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
In an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA after mid@@ night , he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ wo@@ che &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; He almost b@@ led to death , he was un@@ conscious , then he dra@@ gged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; quoted SAP co-@@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ tner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t will however be able to return to work .
&quot; We are meeting up at the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf at the beginning of October , &quot; said Plat@@ tner .
The 5@@ 4-@@ year-old manager will be at the meeting and &quot; fully fit for work &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutschen Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
&quot; I am definitely there for SAP , completely involved in my job . &quot;
&quot; I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , Has@@ so Plat@@ tner , the whole time , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t told the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
I@@ i is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; It could happen to anyone &quot; .
&quot; The important thing is to get up again if you fall down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren reserve driver Mag@@ n@@ us@@ sen out of action …
Mag@@ n@@ us@@ sen twi@@ tter@@ ed a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike .
This means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers , Fern@@ ando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as sli@@ m as those for the Grand Prix in Japan a week later .
Foot@@ ball : B@@ V@@ B v Kra@@ sno@@ dar without Re@@ us : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in goal
All hopes have been crus@@ hed for Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund that Marco Re@@ us might make a com@@ eb@@ ack in the first group match of the European le@@ ague .
The international player will also be missing from the German Bundes@@ lig@@ a leader &apos;s match in its dual with F@@ K Kra@@ sno@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sky ) .
&quot; Unfortunately he isn &apos;t in the running , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
The B@@ V@@ B coach is leaving it open as to whether Re@@ us will be there on Sunday in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a top match against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en : &quot; We are expecting him to return to training on Friday &quot; .
In light of the heavy burden on his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Re@@ us &apos;s position .
So he has announced a change of go@@ al@@ keep@@ er .
Thus Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of regular keep@@ er Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; He &apos;s training at absolute top level , &quot; pra@@ ised the world champion &apos;s football coach .
Tu@@ ch@@ el is leaving it open as to whether Wei@@ den@@ felder will be used in all European le@@ ague matches in the future .
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game .
Mid@@ fiel@@ der Ju@@ lian Wei@@ gl considers team m@@ ate Re@@ us &apos;s br@@ is@@ k statement that the final of the European le@@ ague must be B@@ V@@ B &apos;s objective quite understandable : &quot; Marco isn &apos;t so far off the mark with that &quot; .
&quot; I think we &apos;ve got a good chance of pi@@ cking up the title . &quot;
Rob@@ ot cars : Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars .
On Wednesday the German cab@@ inet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday , on the br@@ ink of the IA@@ A motor show , about a &quot; new era of mobility &quot; .
Autom@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic j@@ ams , said D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt .
He wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
The Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio .
There is currently a test area on the A@@ 9 motorway to try out the new technology .
In order that &quot; no extra liability risk will be imposed &quot; on drivers , the government wants to &quot; examine and , where necessary , adapt &quot; legal parameters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ ver@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
The German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
With automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
However dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles &quot; are not anticipated until 2020 &quot; on public roads .
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will be around € 8.@@ 4 billion for 20@@ 25 .
&quot; Digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; says SP@@ D transport politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
However the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers &apos; personal data must be conclu@@ sively clarified .
And Germans still view dri@@ ver@@ less cars scep@@ tically – much more than the French or Americans .
A survey by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation Dek@@ ra , presented to the IA@@ A on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
In France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonom@@ ously driven cars by 20@@ 25 and in the USA 33 percent .
Any@@ way drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
According to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
Nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on motor@@ ways in free-@@ f@@ lowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic j@@ ams .
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l not to play in team and doub@@ les in European Championship
As things stand , the D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf player plans to play only in the sing@@ les in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision will be made on 22 September .
&quot; It is a major loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; The l@@ ads heard about it this morning . &quot;
&quot; But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Tim@@ o , &quot; said national coach J@@ ör@@ g Ros@@ sk@@ op@@ f during European Championship training in D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf .
At this time Bol@@ l was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with spon@@ sors in China .
The 3@@ 4-@@ year-old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; Without Tim@@ o we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favou@@ rites , &quot; declared individual European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ char@@ ov .
But the Ham@@ e@@ lin player , who is the top seed in E@@ k@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also re@@ members the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at in 2013 .
&quot; We didn &apos;t have Tim@@ o then either , and we still became European Champ@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; That is what we need to focus on , &quot; declared the world number five .
The English football national player Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
In the course of the tackle in the Champ@@ ions League game with PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the def@@ ender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and after a long b@@ out of treatment was replaced .
In@@ i@@ tial diagnosis indicates that the 20-@@ year-old who used to play with Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ stei@@ ger has broken his ti@@ bia .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old to be an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works chamber of hor@@ rors : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday .
The highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look al@@ arm@@ ingly human thanks to video projec@@ tion .
They wear the French designer &apos;s spectacular cre@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onna &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and also put men in sk@@ ir@@ ts .
&quot; These days I can &apos;t say I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture any longer , because I have white hair . &quot;
“ It used to be ble@@ ached , nowadays it &apos;s real , ” says Gau@@ l@@ tier .
For visitors to the exhibition , &quot; From the S@@ ide@@ walk to the Cat@@ walk &quot; , which can be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle at the H@@ yp@@ o Culture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluc@@ tant attitude to a show about his own character .
Origin@@ ally he was against it because , &quot; For me an exhibition sound@@ ed a bit like death , &quot; he said .
When you die , you get put into a museum .
This remarkable collection has already been st@@ aged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
It &apos;s about a lot more than beautiful clothes , &quot; says the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Ro@@ ger D@@ ieder@@ en .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhi@@ bits provide an insight into the hard to over@@ look work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
The show is not constructed chron@@ ologically , but it is a brilli@@ antly cho@@ re@@ ograph@@ ed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins &apos; hair .
According to cur@@ ator Th@@ ier@@ r@@ y-@@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the cre@@ ators car@@ ted 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
Shor@@ tly before the start of Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest there was also a special treat in store : a Leder@@ ho@@ sen out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Mad@@ onna
He has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are cle@@ ver@@ er than men &quot; ) and in people who are a little different , says Gau@@ l@@ tier .
Even Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old te@@ d@@ dy is on show in the exhibition .
He represents the designer &apos;s first , tent@@ ative steps at fashion .
As a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and he was bad at football ) , he dres@@ sed his te@@ d@@ dy in br@@ as and dres@@ ses .
His parents did not allow him to play with d@@ olls .
Later he taught himself fashion design .
He st@@ ole fashion magazines and scrut@@ in@@ ised other designers &apos; cre@@ ations , Gau@@ l@@ tier told us in Munich .
Of course , later I bought them .
He was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Dec@@ oration instead of cur@@ tains – P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace as a fashion nich@@ e
There used to be long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en making many metres
of em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and l@@ aces in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table clo@@ ths and cur@@ tains .
This is no longer the case today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ des@@ pit@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en .
Instead , fashion is once more important .
In the early days of P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home textile industry – and now it is being re@@ discovered as a nich@@ e .
Rein@@ hardt gave a few examples : l@@ ace in decoration , for accessories such as bags and for traditional cost@@ umes .
Gener@@ ally , so-called vin@@ tage fashion , based on style eras from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
Anyone in the textile industry in Germany who cannot serve a nich@@ e is no longer in the market .
We are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
Mo@@ des@@ pit@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien trade association .
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
Sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
There are now hardly any private speci@@ ality shops or wholes@@ al@@ ers .
Our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
Nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more che@@ ap@@ ly in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
Furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weak@@ ening slightly .
This is enough reason for new directions .
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness , as Cor@@ deli@@ a Bauer of Sti@@ ck@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein explains . &quot; As of this year we have implemented a seal of quality which shows that our production is ec@@ ologically and socially compatible .
Rein@@ hardt added , &quot; This also applies to the materials we use &quot; .
Quali@@ fied designer U@@ te Schmi@@ dt te@@ aches in the fac@@ ul@@ ty for applied arts at the Schnee@@ berg branch of the West Sax@@ ony University of Z@@ wick@@ au and speciali@@ ses in em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y and l@@ ace .
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is a field of tension between the designers &apos; newest ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , &quot; says Schmi@@ dt .
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
A few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter rev@@ itali@@ sed the historic snow@@ ball l@@ ace .
The machines em@@ bro@@ i@@ der small be@@ ads in selected places .
P@@ lau@@ en master gol@@ ds@@ mith Bi@@ an@@ ca H@@ alle@@ b@@ ach@@ -@@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this . &quot; In the past I had no use for traditional P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace &quot; .
Now she uses the snow@@ ball l@@ ace for her je@@ well@@ ery .
Using an elabor@@ ate process she embo@@ sses the pattern in silver .
&quot; Many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace – young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
She also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland – primarily to customers whose fore@@ fathers lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
So with my je@@ well@@ ery I see myself as a modern amb@@ assador for P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t interfere with legen@@ ds , but Disney is dar@@ ing to make a new film of the classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; anyway .
But according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not going to be a re@@ make but a sort of sequ@@ el , set 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ ann@@ y .
It is about the n@@ ann@@ y &apos;s experiences with the Ban@@ ks family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
Who is going to take the role of Mary P@@ opp@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is not yet certain .
But the director has been decided : Ro@@ b Mar@@ shall , whose most recent film was &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; .
X@@ i ur@@ ges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping told a group t@@ asked with ste@@ ering reform on Tuesday .
&quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investment and expertise , and improve open@@ ing-up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for De@@ ep@@ ening Overall Reform .
Pro@@ mot@@ ing opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of bor@@ der-@@ control policies , encouraging state-@@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absor@@ b private capital and over@@ hau@@ ling the resident registration system .
According to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off-@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ locating resources , ensuring a la@@ w-@@ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loo@@ sen controls on the powers it deleg@@ ates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
In a bid to open up state-@@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign@@ -@@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
In addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by optim@@ izing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
Guar@@ an@@ te@@ eing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting .

EU wants to double the mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neuro@@ tox@@ in .
The consumer organisation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . &quot; Ris@@ ks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregn@@ ant women and small children , &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
According to Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt , the limits for the neuro@@ tox@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example sh@@ ark or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mer@@ cury per ki@@ lo@@ gram of fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; .
Large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish however are today so heavily contam@@ inated with mer@@ cury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of cat@@ ches may not be sold .
Once the limit has been doub@@ led , however , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
In return for this relaxation the EU , according to F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.@@ 1 mg of mer@@ cury per ki@@ lo@@ gram .
But F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch describes this as a &quot; tri@@ ck &quot; , because smaller pre@@ y fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today .
The reduction for small fish therefore is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous diver@@ sion@@ ary tac@@ tic which helps only the economy , &quot; decla@@ res Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt .
Mer@@ cury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accum@@ ul@@ ates largely in the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that &quot; even low levels , particularly in un@@ born children , can lead to damage to the ner@@ vous system &quot; .
The German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a &quot; health risk to the general population &quot; is not anticipated .
Mer@@ cury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bun@@ de@@ stag member Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , discharge more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury per year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
The concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , for example in the El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; exten@@ sively exceeded on a long-term basis , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
In the past year , Europ@@ e-@@ wide al@@ er@@ ts on mer@@ cury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .

Gut@@ ach : Incre@@ ased safety for pedestri@@ ans
They are not even 100 metres apart : On Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorf@@ park@@ platz in Gut@@ ach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .
Two sets of lights so close to one another : inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error ?
Yesterday , Gut@@ acht &apos;s Mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
&quot; At the time , the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained Eck@@ ert yesterday .
The K@@ lus@@ er lights protect cy@@ cli@@ sts , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Ber@@ gle .
The system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the Sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ weg / Kir@@ ch@@ strasse junction .
We have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Gru@@ b &apos; residential area .
&quot; At times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said Eck@@ ert .
This was also confirmed by Peter Arn@@ old from the Offen@@ burg District Office .
&quot; According to current measurements , around 12@@ ,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gut@@ ach on the B@@ 33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised Arn@@ old .
Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary : &quot; Here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said Arn@@ old .
A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a round@@ about was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the narro@@ wn@@ ess of the Sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ weg / Kir@@ ch@@ strasse jun@@ ctions .
According to Arn@@ old , every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts : &quot; Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trun@@ ks , we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ weg without kno@@ cking over the traffic light posts &quot; .
The traffic light system itself , which cost around EUR 15@@ ,000 , is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market , &quot; explained Arn@@ old .
The system is fitted with coloured LE@@ Ds , which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
And they are also energy-@@ efficient : The older light systems consu@@ me around 100 Wat@@ ts , with the new ones consum@@ ing just eight .
There are three sets of lights per direction of travel .
Arn@@ old explained the technology used by the new system : It is fitted with two ra@@ dar sensors .
If the pedestrian pres@@ ses the button at the traffic lights , the top ra@@ dar sensor checks the traffic status .
If the street is clear , the pedestrian ob@@ tains a green light immediately , if not , there is a delay of around 15 seconds .
An additional ra@@ dar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .
&quot; If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained Arn@@ old .
Of course , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .
Yesterday this was not the case : The light had barely turned green for pedestri@@ ans when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light .
For more than 30 years , Josef Win@@ kler has been writing from the heart , telling of the hard@@ ships of his childhood and youth .
The catastrop@@ hes of his Catholic village up@@ bringing - the spe@@ ech@@ less@@ ness , his tendency towards bru@@ te force and dul@@ led sexu@@ ality , the con@@ fin@@ ement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the Ka@@ ern@@ ten-@@ born po@@ et .
The Bü@@ chner pri@@ ze@@ winner is known primarily as a writer of pro@@ se , with theatre texts something of a r@@ arity for him .
In a col@@ lage of pro@@ se texts For his performance piece , &quot; Wetter@@ leu@@ chten auf der Zun@@ gen@@ spitze &quot; ( Summer ligh@@ tn@@ ing on the tip of your tongue ) , which can now be seen in Garage X on Pe@@ ter@@ splatz , Ger@@ hard Fres@@ acher , creates a col@@ lage of pro@@ se texts .
The theatre producer has thus combined elements from the auto@@ bi@@ ographi@@ cally inspired novel &quot; Der Lei@@ bei@@ gene &quot; ( 1987 ) &#91; The Bon@@ ds@@ man &#93; featuring pro@@ se mini@@ atures from &quot; Lei@@ chn@@ am , seine Familie bel@@ au@@ ern@@ d &quot; ( 2003 ) &#91; Cor@@ pse , stal@@ king his family &#93; .
On the predomin@@ antly empty stage - with one important requirement : a cru@@ m@@ pled sofa , on which cast members all@@ ude to cop@@ ul@@ ating and ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating - the eigh@@ t-@@ person ens@@ emble work their way through the text material .
However , Director Fres@@ acher seems to have little trust in the text .
The 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance g@@ losses over the script with a host of director &apos;s addi@@ tions , well-known from the re@@ pertoire of post-@@ dramatic theat@@ rical styles .
In particular , the ac@@ tre@@ sses play a major role in the sometimes rather du@@ bi@@ ous st@@ aging .
They are man@@ handled , their heads held under water , tack@@ ed to the wall by their evening go@@ wns .
W@@ ra@@ pped in cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane or in gir@@ d@@ les , they st@@ um@@ ble on danger@@ ously high he@@ els across the set , either delivering mon@@ olo@@ gues at the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage .
However , the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery .
The best moments of the evening is when the singing starts - tracks range from Deep Pur@@ ple to traditional folk songs .
Only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see f@@ las@@ hes of Win@@ kler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of hum@@ our .
A black box in your car ?
As America &apos;s road plann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to mend a cru@@ mb@@ ling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car .
The devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and trans@@ mit that information to bureau@@ crats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to over@@ hau@@ l the out@@ dated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
The usually dul@@ l arena of highway planning has suddenly spa@@ wn@@ ed intense debate and color@@ ful alli@@ ances .
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lob@@ b@@ ying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The tea party is ag@@ hast .
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
And while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of motor@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
&quot; It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Has@@ an I@@ k@@ hr@@ ata , executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n@@ . of Govern@@ ments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country &apos;s High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
Car@@ s get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , 18.@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
Poli@@ ti@@ cians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one p@@ enny when gas prices are high .
&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pa@@ y-@@ by-@@ mile system .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call it a mi@@ lea@@ ge-@@ based user fee .
It is no surprise that the idea appe@@ als to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be ri@@ gged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce con@@ gestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California plann@@ ers are looking to the system as they dev@@ ise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
But Rep@@ . Bill S@@ hu@@ ster ( R-@@ P@@ a . ) , chairman of the House Transpor@@ tation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
The free mark@@ e@@ te@@ ers at the Re@@ as@@ on Foundation are also f@@ ond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adri@@ an Mo@@ ore , vice president of policy at Re@@ as@@ on .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U.S. Transpor@@ tation secre@@ t@@ aries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pa@@ y-@@ per@@ -@@ mile direction .
The U.S. Sen@@ ate approved a $ 9@@ 0-@@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve log@@ ging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
The most e@@ ager is O@@ reg@@ on , which is en@@ listing 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
Those drivers will soon pay the mile@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Il@@ lin@@ ois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
And the I-@@ 95 Co@@ alition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ aboard ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ inia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; Conc@@ ern@@ s about Big Bro@@ ther and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din Kh@@ an , who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transpor@@ tation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got under@@ way , the AC@@ L@@ U of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-@@ fle@@ dged tracking devices . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings .
Nevada is among several states now scra@@ mb@@ ling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , Kh@@ an said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hun@@ t for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California star@@ tu@@ p called Tru@@ e Mi@@ le@@ age .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mile@@ age .
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway plann@@ ers because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , up@@ loaded periodi@@ cally by mo@@ dem .
&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ry@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , chief executive of Tru@@ e Mi@@ le@@ age .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
There are a lot less expensive and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this .
In O@@ reg@@ on , plann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with giving drivers different choices .
They can choose a device with or without GPS .
Or they can choose not to have a device at all , op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a war@@ y public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pa@@ y-@@ as-@@ you@@ -@@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; Motor@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some transportation plann@@ ers , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant di@@ stra@@ ction .
At the Metro@@ politan Transpor@@ tation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ rupt High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund by raising gas taxes .
An extra one-@@ time or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an asp@@ ir@@ in , &quot; said Rand@@ y R@@ entsch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
König@@ s@@ feld : Small team gives a spiri@@ ted performance
The voluntary fire service bra@@ vely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel .
Only ele@@ ven men took part in the exercise .
For the training exercise , department comm@@ ander , Hans Kam@@ mer@@ er , chose the Fe@@ der premises on Burg@@ berger Strasse .
A short-@@ circuit was reported to have occurred there during sa@@ wing .
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke , however , one was able to make an emergency call .
Two fire figh@@ ters equipped with re@@ spir@@ atory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by Hans Kam@@ mer@@ er .
After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building .
The second person had to be carried .
This was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow sta@@ ir@@ well .
The building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ ling for two horses , was not easy to secure .
There were large quantities of wood and bal@@ es of stra@@ w stored inside .
In addition to this , there were also electrical machines for wood processing .
The first attempt to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fire was made using the tank on the fire engine .
Another line was taken from the surface hy@@ d@@ rant around 100 metres away .
Only three attempts could be made to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the bla@@ ze .
A hol@@ low-@@ stream no@@ zzle in the building was also used .
For Hans Kam@@ mer@@ er , the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available staff .
In case of emergency , support is provided by the König@@ s@@ feld day@@ time task force .
The Commander expressed his satisfaction following the exercise .
Net@@ working between universities and companies is important
On a visit to the district of Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ -@@ Hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald , it was explained to Parliamentary President Gui@@ do Wolf in T@@ iti@@ se@@ e-@@ Neu@@ stadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from .
In the Hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald Support Centre , he addressed this important question alongside the executive princip@@ als of the vocational col@@ leg@@ es and the district gram@@ mar school and the chairs of the parents &apos; council .
&quot; Education is an important factor for the location , &quot; highlighted Clau@@ dia Ste@@ h@@ le , Director of the Hans Th@@ oma School , which introduced the net@@ worked Hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald Education Centre Scho@@ ols Project .
During the presentation , Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project .
Since 2011 , there has been successful collaboration in Wäl@@ der@@ stadt between the Support Centre , the District Gra@@ mm@@ ar School and the Vo@@ c@@ ational School Comple@@ x .
He also pra@@ ised the family-@@ friendly approach within the district .
&quot; It is important , not only to keep the family life stage in mind , but , on account of demographic change , the period spent providing long-term care and support for relatives as well , &quot; explained Wolf .
He also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care and support of relatives .
&quot; Without support from their emplo@@ yer , the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract , &quot; said Wolf .
However , nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , &quot; he added .
Another , particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies .
&quot; After all , people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region , along with their acquired knowledge and skills , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , &quot; said the State Parliamentary President , expressing his thorough conviction .
For it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered .
In his opinion , the district &apos;s advantage as a location is its advanta@@ geous location in south-@@ west Germany , in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland .
In addition to this , on his train journey from T@@ iti@@ se@@ e-@@ Neu@@ stadt to Freiburg , he experienced first-@@ hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport .
&quot; You must continue to be ten@@ acious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better , &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in atten@@ dance .
Music makes for an enter@@ taining afternoon
It was 15 years ago that the Kau@@ l family first invited the Di@@ et@@ ingen senior citizens for coffee and ca@@ ke , followed by a snack .
Pre@@ viously , the elderly citizens were hosted in the service station can@@ teen .
The coffee afternoon is now held in the St. Josef nur@@ sing home .
The residents of the home were delighted with the delicious c@@ akes and tar@@ ts .
Later on , a s@@ aus@@ age sal@@ ad was provided .
Sil@@ via K@@ imm@@ ich@@ -B@@ ant@@ le and her father Karl K@@ im@@ mich enter@@ tained those in atten@@ dance with popular tun@@ es .
The more than 10@@ 0-@@ year-old natural stone wall , serving as the foremost bound@@ ary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and Kir@@ ch@@ strasse , will once again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of B@@ rä@@ un@@ lingen .
In the days before the Kil@@ big Aut@@ umn Fol@@ k Festival , when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard , a small corner wall with b@@ alu@@ stra@@ des was installed to stabili@@ se and relie@@ ve the static load on the old natural stone wall , which is more than one hundred years old .
According to Alexander Mis@@ ok of the B@@ rä@@ un@@ lingen Municip@@ al Plan@@ ning and Building Control Authority , the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Mem@@ orial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall .
A cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals , which will then be submitted to the Town Council , which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure .
A decision is expected to be made in the coming year .
Following the renovation , pla@@ stering and plan@@ ting of trees in the old internal school yard , within the two w@@ ings of the 19@@ 12 school , as a subsequent measure the bound@@ ary wall , which is in need of refurb@@ ishment , must be renovated from the ground up within the fore@@ see@@ able future .
The historic , one hund@@ re@@ d-@@ year-old bound@@ ary wall between the old school@@ -@@ yard and Kir@@ ch@@ strasse is in need of renovation , primarily as a result of water and fro@@ st damage , on account of the lack of dra@@ in@@ age , and is le@@ an@@ ing for@@ wards .
Deep cra@@ cks in a number of individual stones t@@ esti@@ fy to the weather damage , however , at present the wall is not in danger of collapse .
A secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils , and this is the purpose of the current forti@@ fication work .
The school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 , however , high un@@ planned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back .
The Regional Mem@@ orial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation , which has even been used for fil@@ ming .
If this authority were to impose requirements , then the town of B@@ rä@@ un@@ lingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument pre@@ serv@@ ation@@ ists .
The pupils of the B@@ rä@@ un@@ lingen Pri@@ mary School , who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building , with a new hall , will soon be able to use the old school yard as well .
Ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
C@@ em Ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , Federal Chairman of the Green Party , has now engaged in the ongoing discussions regarding the future of the Baden-@@ Wu@@ er@@ ttem@@ berg Music Academy .
&quot; I do not think it is right to abandon comprehensive training in the Stuttgart Music College , &quot; said Ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , speaking to the &quot; Stuttgar@@ ter Nachrichten &quot; .
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart .
As such , Ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who is the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 September , is in dis@@ agreement with the Gre@@ en-@@ Red State Government .
On the basis of an expert study , this government is ur@@ ging the re@@ organisation of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in Baden-@@ Wu@@ er@@ ttem@@ berg .
In accordance with these plans , the jazz and pop courses , among others , are to be re@@ located from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College .
US borders : &quot; Super tunnel &quot; for drug smu@@ ggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the USA , investig@@ ators have discovered and shut down a &quot; super tunnel &quot; intended for drug smu@@ ggling .
As announced by the US Customs Auth@@ orities , the pipe between Ti@@ ju@@ ana and San Die@@ go , measuring more than 500 metres in length , was equipped with electricity , a railway track and a ven@@ tilation system .
Three sus@@ pects were de@@ tained in relation to the discovery , with eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine sei@@ zed .
According to the details provided , the tunnel had not yet been put into use .
&quot; These car@@ tels are stup@@ id if they think that they can dig through under the ra@@ dar , &quot; said the US Att@@ or@@ ney for the District of Southern California , Lau@@ ra Di@@ ff@@ y , at a press conference held in front of a ware@@ house in San Die@@ go , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .
Refer@@ ring to the drug gangs , Du@@ ff@@ y assured : &quot; If you continue to build and attempt to use these tun@@ nels , we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money &quot; .
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug car@@ tels .
Since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico .
Built by experts
Due to the elabor@@ ate configuration of the tunnel , investig@@ ators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year .
The railway system was equipped in such a way that electri@@ cally powered car@@ ts could be used on it .
On the Mexican side , the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border .
According to the authorities , a lad@@ der runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
The tunnel has a cross-@@ section measuring 1.@@ 20 metres high and 90 cen@@ timet@@ res across .
It would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA .
Two of the sus@@ pects were de@@ tained in conjunction with the co@@ ca@@ ine find .
The third , a Mexican , was de@@ tained due to the sei@@ z@@ ure of the mari@@ ju@@ ana .
All three face a maximum penalty of life im@@ prison@@ ment , according to the authorities .
Since 2006 , eight tun@@ nels of this type have been discovered , the press conference in San Die@@ go continued .
However , this was the first time that co@@ ca@@ ine was found in such a tunnel construction .
Norm@@ ally co@@ ca@@ ine is smu@@ gg@@ led in smaller quantities and not through tun@@ nels .
This shows the &quot; desper@@ ation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sher@@ man of the D@@ EA Dru@@ g S@@ qu@@ ad in San Die@@ go .
They will do anything to make it to the USA .
No specific details were given regarding those de@@ tained , but it is reported that at least one is Mexican
They can expect prison terms of up to ten years .
2014 is to be a year of celebration in Gei@@ s@@ ingen
The anniversary celebrations in the town of Gei@@ s@@ ingen , to mark the 1,@@ 25@@ 0@@ th
anniversary of the first documented mention of the town , are drawing closer .
When the year comes to an end in just eight weeks , the anniversary year will be upon us .
Gei@@ s@@ ingen and Kirchen@@ -@@ Hau@@ sen were first documented together in the year 7@@ 94 .
A de@@ ed was drafted in Kirchen , in which both towns are mentioned .
On 15 March , the anniversary year will be officially launched , and because Gei@@ s@@ ingen currently has no suitable venues , this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,@@ 250 years ago , in Kirchen@@ -@@ Hau@@ sen .
As part of the anniversary celebrations , a number of events are planned both in Gei@@ s@@ ingen and Kirchen@@ -@@ Hau@@ sen .
Kirchen@@ -@@ Hau@@ sen will celebrate the 1,@@ 25@@ 0@@ th anniversary with a celeb@@ r@@ atory weekend from 18 to 20
July .
On the Friday there will be a ceremony , and on the Saturday and Sunday a party will be held at the Kir@@ ch@@ tal@@ halle .
The Kirchen@@ -@@ Hau@@ sen Kirchen@@ fest festival will also be held on this celeb@@ r@@ atory weekend .
Town Musi@@ cal Director , Ru@@ dol@@ f Bar@@ th , has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .
On 21 June , in conjunction with the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ verein &#91; Black Forest Association &#93; Mid@@ -S@@ ummer Festival , on 12 July in the Arena , accompanied by fire@@ works , and on 13 December as the first concert put on by the Stadt@@ musik ( Town Musi@@ cal Society ) in the new Festival Hall .
This venue will be completed and inau@@ gur@@ ated in the anniversary year , with the official date set for the last weekend in September , on 27 and 28 September .
On the occasion of the Gei@@ s@@ ingen town anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le will also be published .
&quot; However , it will not merely be a chron@@ ic@@ le of Gei@@ s@@ ingen itself , but rather a printed work on the Gei@@ s@@ ingen of today , which now consists of Gei@@ s@@ ingen , Kirchen@@ -@@ Hau@@ sen , Leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen , A@@ ul@@ fin@@ gen and Gut@@ ma@@ d@@ ingen , &quot; said Mayor Walter H@@ eng@@ st@@ ler .
And the Gei@@ s@@ ingen of today is also celeb@@ rating a birthday in 2014 , as it was in 1974 that the incorpor@@ ations to form the current region were completed .
The new chron@@ ic@@ le is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Gei@@ s@@ ingen .
However , 2014 is also a year of many anni@@ vers@@ aries in other respects .
The Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft Stro@@ h@@ g@@ lon@@ ki ( Stro@@ h@@ g@@ lon@@ ki F@@ ool &apos;s Guil@@ d celebration ) begins on 8 February with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year anniversary / The Harmonie Gut@@ ma@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celeb@@ r@@ atory ban@@ quet and then from 1 to 4 May will be celeb@@ rating the Bezir@@ ks@@ fest &#91; District Music Festival &#93; .
The Leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen N@@ ur@@ sing Home will turn 40 years old , the Gei@@ s@@ ingen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celeb@@ rating this on 10 May , and the Poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia Leip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celeb@@ rating this as part of the Brun@@ nen@@ fest &#91; Fo@@ un@@ tain Festival &#93; from 4 to 7 July .
The town of Gei@@ s@@ ingen was first officially documented in the year 7@@ 64 , in a de@@ ed of donation , which is now in the possession of the St. G@@ allen Mon@@ astery .
The de@@ ed was drawn up in Kirchen ( Hau@@ sen ) , which at the time was the location of the cour@@ thouse .
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same de@@ ed .
One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,@@ 25@@ 0-@@ year anniversary in this way , is that it also coinci@@ des with the 40@@ th anniversary of the Community Reform ( Gemein@@ der@@ e@@ form ) .
Council sets its sights on rail system
Should the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing be re@@ constructed at great cost , in order to increase traffic safety ?
The Town Coun@@ cils have decided that the answer is yes .
Schil@@ ta@@ ch will have to contribute up to EUR 2@@ 20@@ ,000 to the project .
The Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kin@@ zi@@ gt@@ al railway line in the coming year .
In particular , safety at railway cross@@ ings is to be increased - col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country .
If the municip@@ alities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will be required to contribute one third of the costs , with the remain@@ der divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government .
Schil@@ ta@@ ch &apos;s town master mas@@ on , Rol@@ and Grie@@ ß@@ haber , explained the pec@@ uli@@ arities of the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing to the Town Council .
At the crossing , the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line .
Lar@@ ger vehicles , for example those that transport long logs , would be able to wait there in the event of on@@ coming traffic , without having to block the railway line .
Grie@@ ß@@ haber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course wi@@ den the ad@@ joining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .
This was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to wi@@ den the road : Thomas Ki@@ pp sum@@ mar@@ ised the perspective of the critics with this statement : &quot; Do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;
Mayor Thomas Ha@@ as re@@ tor@@ ted : The &quot; Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs .
Even wood from the &quot; Ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is occasionally transported via this route , as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the Hä@@ ber@@ les Bridge , as they would not be able to make the turn on the Haupt@@ strasse .
Furthermore , when the Haupt@@ strasse is blocked , the route would also serve as a b@@ yp@@ ass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argued Ha@@ as .
Given that it is likely that the Kir@@ ch@@ berg and Schlo@@ ss@@ berg tunnel will have to be re@@ constructed and renovated , as is currently the case in Wol@@ fach , the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .
The coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned wi@@ dening of the road would inc@@ ur .
Nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was con@@ s@@ ented to by a majority , on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could , if required , extend the connecting road in the &quot; Bahn@@ hof@@ straße &quot; direction to around 5.@@ 5 metres to accommodate on@@ coming traffic .
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trau@@ tw@@ ein t@@ ann@@ ery could , on the other hand , bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot; Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ häuser Weg &quot; .
The Administ@@ rative Department had Deutsche Bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investigated by the Bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er Engineering Office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ häuser Weg will be straightforward .
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inc@@ lin@@ ation of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck .
The town , as the authority responsible for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .
The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .
Because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are , the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be con@@ s@@ ented to , argued Ha@@ as .
At this point , the risk of a train col@@ li@@ sion with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway cross@@ ings , on account of the fact that there is a mid@@ point from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the st@@ opping point .
The trains themselves , coming from the central station , must also be sufficiently s@@ lowed down so that there is no threat of col@@ li@@ sion .
According to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors , the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority , as the town of Schil@@ ta@@ ch would &quot; bear the br@@ unt of the cost &quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck , since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work .
The committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; Vor Heu@@ bach &quot; and &apos; Vor Ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; railway cross@@ ings , for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn , to be un@@ problematic .
ESA makes decision on major space missions : Mis@@ sions co@@ sting billions
Di@@ stant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years .
There were 30 proposals to choose from , five of which are still in the running .
Di@@ stant worlds .
Astronom@@ ers have already found more than 1,000 plan@@ ets near other stars .
Whether or not life exists on at least some of these , no-@@ one knows .
The choice is a difficult one : Should we search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
Or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmo@@ s ?
Or search for plan@@ ets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life ?
These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency , ESA .
For their &quot; Co@@ sm@@ ic Vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which should greatly advance research .
The budget for &quot; L-@@ Mis@@ sions &quot; such as this lies at around one billion Euro .
The projects are planned to start in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
At the beginning of September , the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , of which five have now made it onto the short list .
Num@@ erous panels are assessing the proposals , posing questions to the researchers .
Over the coming days , a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee .
In total , four main questions were chosen by the ESA , to which the missions of the &quot; Co@@ sm@@ ic Vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers .
What are the conditions required for the formation of plan@@ ets and life ?
The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clou@@ ds - and thus the formation of the plan@@ ets that or@@ bit these stars - lie in pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dark@@ ness .
A large infra@@ -@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could penet@@ rate this dark@@ ness .
And if a star has plan@@ ets , under what circumstances can life exist there ?
In order to pursue this question , the &quot; Che@@ ops &quot; space tel@@ es@@ cope is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , with which 500 known plan@@ etary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail .
The possibilities are , however , limited - Che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro .
With larger instruments , astronom@@ ers could map plan@@ ets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmosp@@ heres , and thus search for &quot; biom@@ ark@@ ers &quot; : gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity .
How does the solar system function ?
This question should also provide information regarding the pre@@ conditions for the origins of life .
The magnetic activity of a star , the interaction of its magnetic field and the emit@@ ted partic@@ le radiation play an important role .
It is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system , to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere .
With the &quot; Solar Or@@ bit@@ er &quot; , the ESA has already approved an M-@@ class mission ( for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro ) to address this matter .
The probe is to be launched in 20@@ 17 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
J@@ up@@ iter and its mo@@ ons are also of great interest to the researchers .
They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
The ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L-@@ Mis@@ sions of the &quot; Co@@ sm@@ ic Vision &quot; programme will address this subject .
The &quot; Ju@@ ice &quot; ( J@@ up@@ iter I@@ cy Mo@@ ons Explorer ) probe is planned to begin its journey in 20@@ 22 .
Ei@@ ght years later it will reach J@@ up@@ iter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ic@@ y mo@@ ons Europa , Cal@@ list@@ o and G@@ any@@ me@@ de .
What are the basic physical laws of the Uni@@ verse ?
O@@ uter space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .
There may also be devi@@ ations that could show physi@@ cians the path to a new theory , under the umbrel@@ la of which all known natural laws could be united .
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?
13.@@ 7 billion years ago , our cosmo@@ s was created by the Big B@@ ang .
Al@@ ongside the materials familiar to us , from which stars , plan@@ ets and life forms such as ourselves are composed , there exists dark matter , the gra@@ vit@@ ational force of which holds galax@@ ies and galax@@ y clu@@ sters together , and dark energy , the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe .
Thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big B@@ ang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .
With &quot; Eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; , the ESA has already approved an M-@@ mission , planned to comm@@ ence in 2020 .
With a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .
Pro@@ pos@@ als that are in the running ...
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
The proposal with the best chance of approval as an L-@@ mission , in the opinion of many experts , is &quot; E-@@ Lis@@ a &quot; , a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
Many physi@@ cians perc@@ eive this to ent@@ ail changes in the structure of spac@@ e-@@ time , which Albert Ein@@ stein predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
To date they have never been proved to exist .
The scientists behind the project hope that Eli@@ sa could achieve this .
The mission involves placing a dete@@ c@@ tor , consisting of two or three prob@@ es , in outer space .
Unlike systems on Earth , it could also prove gra@@ vit@@ ational waves created during the Big B@@ ang , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmo@@ s .
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-@@ mission place : a large X-@@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; Ath@@ ena &quot; , which among other things would research black holes , &quot; I@@ cy Plan@@ ets &quot; , another mission to the outer plan@@ ets of the solar system , &quot; pr@@ ism &quot; , a mission for the measurement of co@@ sm@@ ic background radiation , and the &quot; Ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et Fin@@ der &quot; , which would find and investigate plan@@ ets similar to Earth .
Among others , proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars , conducting research on the moon , Ven@@ us and ast@@ ero@@ ids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physi@@ cs .
Snow@@ den ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany over US surveillance
Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den , the US intelligence whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Kei@@ th Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
German M@@ P Hans@@ -@@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e on Thursday met Mr Snow@@ den in Russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him t@@ esti@@ fying in Germany .
A letter from Mr Snow@@ den , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the M@@ P , said : &quot; Though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ stra@@ bly positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ec@@ tion , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .
In the letter , Mr Snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
The charges filed by the US justice department include es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of government property .
Hans@@ -@@ Peter Friedrich , German interior minister , told Zeit Online : &quot; If Mr Snow@@ den is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
Relations between the US and Germany have come under stra@@ in following claims that the N@@ SA bu@@ gged Chancellor Angela &apos;s Merkel &apos;s phone .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , the M@@ P who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snow@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the US , &quot; it should be taken .
Mr Strö@@ bel@@ e , an M@@ P for Germany &apos;s Green party , published a picture of himself with Mr Snow@@ den on his Twitter feed .
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists .
Mr Strö@@ bel@@ e said that , according to the former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor &apos;s lawyer , Mr Snow@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
If Mr Snow@@ den t@@ esti@@ fied in Germany he would need assur@@ ances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , the M@@ P said .
Mr Snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home .
However he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the re@@ vel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service .
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
Fron@@ tier Airlines to charge for car@@ r@@ y-@@ on baggage
Fron@@ tier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store car@@ r@@ y-@@ on luggage on board their flight .
Fron@@ tier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or so@@ da , although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
The new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee is for bags in the over@@ head bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
Fron@@ tier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
Fron@@ tier spo@@ kes@@ woman K@@ ate O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said the $ 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ff@@ ing as much as they can into car@@ r@@ y-@@ on baggage st@@ ash@@ ed in over@@ head b@@ ins , meaning those b@@ ins often run out of space .
Fe@@ es are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
It &apos;s about Fron@@ tier &apos;s most lo@@ yal customers making it very clear that finding over@@ head bin space has become increasingly difficult .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
That means one passenger in line at a Fron@@ tier gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might owe $ 100 for a similar bag .
O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said Fron@@ tier &apos;s website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
Fron@@ tier &apos;s new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee won &apos;t start until summer , though a date has@@ n &apos;t been set .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers often g@@ rum@@ ble about baggage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
They argue that luggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Most haven &apos;t touched car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag fees , though .
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee three years ago , and fellow dis@@ counter Al@@ legi@@ ant Air later followed .
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary &apos;s Wiz@@ z Air , said airline consul@@ tant J@@ ay Sor@@ en@@ sen , who closely tracks ad@@ d-@@ on fees .
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit &apos;s car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
Sor@@ en@@ sen , a former executive with Mid@@ west Airlines , fle@@ w Spirit recently and wonder@@ ed what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag fee .
&quot; The boarding process was the smoo@@ th@@ est I had seen in my airline career , &quot; he said .
I was expecting to see gn@@ ash@@ ing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
The plane was full , he said , &quot; and it boar@@ ded li@@ cket@@ y-@@ split . &quot;
Fron@@ tier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , so@@ da , or juice .
Fron@@ tier said passengers who get so@@ da or juice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee ref@@ ills for free .
It will still give away water .
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers compla@@ ined and no other major airline followed .
Fron@@ tier &apos;s move to charge the car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own website .
Airlines pay online travel s@@ ellers such as Or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
That has given all airlines an incentive to ste@@ er passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
Fron@@ tier has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area , though .
In September it began giving half as many frequent fli@@ er miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
On Wednesday it s@@ las@@ hed the mile@@ age award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
So , a 1,000 mile Fron@@ tier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Fron@@ tier website .
Fron@@ tier has a lo@@ yal base of customers in its home city of Den@@ ver , but its business is shr@@ in@@ king and losing money .
Re@@ venue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shr@@ ank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Hol@@ dings Inc .
Republic has been trying to fix Fron@@ tier &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline .
Sa@@ y@@ ings come from the Bi@@ ble
At least 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast of the year , in the Evange@@ lical Par@@ ish of Bis@@ ingen .
The theme of the day in the parish hall was &quot; Sa@@ y@@ ings from the Bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; Ex@@ pres@@ sions from the Middle A@@ ges &quot; .
Z@@ ita K@@ öh@@ ler , the Chair@@ person of the Par@@ ish Council , agreed to give a talk on Bi@@ b@@ lical pro@@ verb@@ s after breakfast .
&quot; Pro@@ verb@@ s contain pe@@ ar@@ ls of wisdom , comm@@ and@@ ments or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
She compared several German sa@@ y@@ ings with the corresponding Bi@@ ble ver@@ ses and explained the meaning .
She referred to sa@@ y@@ ings such as : &quot; Holz@@ au@@ ge sei wach@@ sam &quot; ( keep your eyes pe@@ eled ) , &quot; wie Schu@@ ppen von den Augen fallen &quot; ( like sc@@ ales falling from one &apos;s eyes ) , &quot; ein Auge auf jemand werfen &quot; ( to cast an eye on someone ) , &quot; den S@@ einen gibt &apos;s der Herr im Schla@@ f &quot; ( good things come to some when they sleep ) and &quot; seine Hände in Un@@ schul@@ d wa@@ schen &quot; ( to w@@ ash one &apos;s hands of something ) .
On several occasions , the speaker asked those listening to gu@@ ess what pro@@ ver@@ b they were based on .
Ex@@ pres@@ sions from the Middle A@@ ges were addressed by Par@@ ish Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Christ@@ el D@@ eh@@ ner : &quot; Al@@ ler guten Dinge sind drei &quot; ( All good things come in thre@@ es ) , &quot; bla@@ u machen &quot; ( to ski@@ p school / work ) , &quot; etwas ver@@ hau@@ en &quot; ( to wal@@ lo@@ p something ) .
She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions , which she referred to as &quot; bridges to the past &quot; .
To round off the morning there was a tom@@ b@@ ola .
The prizes were placed , covered , on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously par@@ aph@@ ra@@ sed prior to being presented to the winners .
May@@ oral candidate Roman Wa@@ iz@@ en@@ eg@@ ger was also to be found among the visitors to the joint breakfast .
Learning rather than unemployment : Tourism pilot project for the un@@ trained
A pilot project for the tourist industry is being launched today in the Mec@@ kl@@ enburg lake district .
Under the management of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 men and women who are already working within the industry as un@@ trained workers , will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three w@@ inters .
&quot; What &apos;s innovative about it is that the six-@@ month courses end with diplom@@ as , &quot; said Carmen Wie@@ ch@@ ert of the Neu@@ brand@@ enburg Employment Agency .
There are many benefits : The participants will not be unemployed , the companies receive trained skilled workers , which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants , and the agency will not have to fund unemployment .
Also involved in the project are the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Deutsche Hotel@@ - und Gast@@ stätte , D@@ eh@@ o@@ ga ) of Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg-@@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
N@@ SA Bl@@ ames &quot; Internal Er@@ ror , &quot; Not Hack@@ ers , For Website Cra@@ sh
The sha@@ dow@@ y National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a gli@@ tch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not h@@ ack@@ ers as some claimed online .
&quot; N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the sp@@ y agency said in an em@@ ailed statement .
The issue will be resolved this evening .
C@@ laim@@ s that the ou@@ tage was caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service &#91; D@@ Do@@ S &#93; attack are not true .
Ear@@ lier this evening online server tra@@ ckers noted the N@@ SA &apos;s website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be in@@ accessible for some users .
Ear@@ lier an N@@ SA spo@@ kes@@ person told AB@@ C News the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; com@@ promised .
No classified information is in danger , the spo@@ kes@@ person said .
At least one h@@ ac@@ ktiv@@ ist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack .
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
The cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is a relatively un@@ sophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penet@@ rate the internal network of the target system .
The formerly super secre@@ tive N@@ SA , once nick@@ named No Such Agency , has found itself in very public light , and am@@ id vi@@ cious criticism , in past months following a stream of re@@ vel@@ ations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collec@@ tively the product of secret N@@ SA files st@@ olen from the agency and le@@ aked by di@@ sen@@ chan@@ ted former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den .
Such growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the agency promp@@ ted early speculation that tonight &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
In October , the number of j@@ ob@@ less fell slightly by 22 , to a total of 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
The rate of 3.1 per cent is indeed better than the previous year and is also better than in September , &quot; however , we had hoped for more , &quot; said Mon@@ ika Fel@@ der-@@ Bauer , acting branch manager of the Employment Agency in Son@@ tho@@ fen .
Several companies have thus far re@@ acted cau@@ ti@@ ously when it comes to hi@@ ring .
St@@ ating a reason for this , Fel@@ der-@@ Bauer said : &quot; We have barely any skilled workers in the fields of skilled crafts and tra@@ des , healthcare and ger@@ i@@ atri@@ c care . &quot;
Se@@ as@@ onal job offers for staff in hotel and restaurant businesses have been coming in since September .
The Winter season within the industry begins in mid-@@ December .

Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er profit di@@ ps as plane deliveries , orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday , pres@@ su@@ red by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
Montre@@ al-@@ based Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er also did not release any flight test data for its br@@ and-@@ new CS@@ eries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .
After the test plane &apos;s inau@@ gu@@ ral flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flo@@ wn three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
Resul@@ ts fell short of forecasts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 percent on the Tor@@ onto Stock Exchange .
Cam@@ eron Do@@ erk@@ sen , an analy@@ st with National Bank Financial , lower@@ ed his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; out@@ perform &quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited up@@ side over the next one or two quarters .
&quot; While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Do@@ erk@@ sen said in a client note .
We believe that Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will receive new orders for the CS@@ eries as the flight test program pro@@ gresses .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more skep@@ tical of the program .
Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes the CS@@ eries aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t it into the low end of a market now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test plane was un@@ vei@@ led in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays .
But firm orders for the CS@@ eries are moderate so far at 17@@ 7 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to vali@@ date the company &apos;s claims about the new jet@@ liner &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
There are currently 4@@ 03 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beau@@ do@@ in was confident Bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .
Exec@@ u@@ tives also reas@@ su@@ red an@@ alyst@@ s and media on Thursday the program was pro@@ gress@@ ing according to schedule .
&quot; The test plane didn &apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s down@@ time .
Every manufacturer sched@@ ules it in a different way .
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .
That will happen all through the flight program .
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remain@@ der following shortly after , the company said .

Co@@ ca@@ ine-@@ addi@@ ct lawyer who ti@@ pped off Mr Big about police investigation is j@@ ailed
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed information to crime l@@ ord N@@ eil S@@ car@@ b@@ rough
The so@@ lic@@ it@@ or fe@@ ared his secret drug addi@@ ction would be exposed
Was given a three-@@ year prison sentence at Li@@ ver@@ pool Cro@@ wn Court
A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation , because he fe@@ ared his secret drug addi@@ ction would be exposed , has been j@@ ailed for three years .
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime l@@ ord N@@ eil S@@ car@@ b@@ rough about in@@ quiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became com@@ promised by his co@@ ca@@ ine hab@@ it .
The so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , who was nick@@ named &quot; Bas@@ h &quot; and ha@@ iled by criminals as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , who he had represented in a previous nar@@ co@@ tics trial .
Offic@@ ers spot@@ ted Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 , drop@@ ping off three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine at the lawyer &apos;s home in Black@@ burn , Lan@@ cas@@ hire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .
In@@ quiries revealed D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his wal@@ let and on his credit cards .
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to il@@ lic@@ itly obtain information on the arre@@ sts of two men on behalf of S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough as well as one of his associ@@ ates .
All four sus@@ pects were being wat@@ ched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a hero@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine ra@@ cket operating across Lan@@ cas@@ hire , Cum@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ shire and West Yor@@ k@@ shire .
They and 32 other men were later j@@ ailed after police sei@@ zed hero@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.@@ 5@@ million along with more than £ 200@@ ,000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his co@@ ca@@ ine addi@@ ction would be exposed
Today at Li@@ ver@@ pool Cro@@ wn Court D@@ it@@ ta , who works at law firm For@@ bes So@@ lic@@ it@@ ors , based in Black@@ burn , was facing dis@@ grace after being found guilty of two counts of per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Li@@ ver@@ pool Cro@@ wn Court .
He admitted co@@ ca@@ ine possession at an earlier hearing .
The lawyer &apos;s down@@ fall came after police investig@@ ating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two dete@@ c@@ tives tra@@ iled the suspect and spot@@ ted him arriving at D@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a p@@ urity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s b@@ ins in a black golf g@@ love .
So@@ on after the drop off , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta who had been out at the dinner at the Black@@ burn Ro@@ vers football stadium , E@@ wood Park .
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
The court heard D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of co@@ ca@@ ine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , wal@@ let and on his credit cards
D@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but denied using co@@ ca@@ ine and and said he had been speaking to the suspec@@ ted dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;
During his arrest D@@ it@@ ta picked up his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all sei@@ zed and a hair sample was taken fo@@ m him .
In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arre@@ sts to tell them what dete@@ c@@ tives knew about them .
Pro@@ sec@@ uting , An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : &quot; If anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or . &quot;
Mr D@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , having become too involved with specific clients .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs .
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .
But this went way beyond the ordinary con@@ fines of a law@@ y@@ er-@@ client relationship .
He th@@ war@@ ted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta was not hon@@ ouring his profession , but dish@@ on@@ ouring it .
He got too close to certain clients , in particular S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
D@@ it@@ ta denied wron@@ g@@ doing and claimed : &quot; If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . &quot;
But after the hearing Sup@@ t Lee Hal@@ stead from Lan@@ cas@@ hire Police said : &quot; Mr D@@ it@@ ta turned from criminal so@@ lic@@ it@@ or to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
His addi@@ ction to co@@ ca@@ ine left him hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly com@@ promised and vulnerable to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime groups who t@@ asked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations .
So@@ lic@@ it@@ ors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should in@@ stil trust and confidence in the public .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta has betra@@ yed this trust and attempted to hide behind the vene@@ er of his profession .
Lan@@ cas@@ hire &apos;s Seri@@ ous and Organ@@ ised Cri@@ me Unit led the investigation into Mr D@@ it@@ ta which has also seen him convi@@ cted of three counts of possession of co@@ ca@@ ine and now per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice , demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice .
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
We will find you and put you before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was j@@ ailed for 14 years after ple@@ ading guilty to con@@ spi@@ racy to supply hero@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and cann@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty five other men involved in the ra@@ cket were j@@ ailed for a total of 15@@ 3 years for drugs offences .
On his website D@@ it@@ ta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantas@@ y job would be a lawyer representing clients on De@@ ath Ro@@ w in America , his ultimate dinner guest as being Moh@@ amm@@ ed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work .
Revolu@@ tionary Sac@@ red Music Fac@@ tory
To close the celebrations on the occasion of its 16@@ 0@@ th anniversary , the L@@ ieder@@ kran@@ z Dun@@ n@@ ingen ( Dun@@ n@@ ingen Amat@@ eur Cho@@ ir , or Gle@@ e Club , if you like ) will perform Franz Schu@@ bert &apos;s &quot; Deutsche Messe &quot; ( German M@@ ass ) to accompany two church services .
Following the great success of the musical , &quot; Rock my Life &quot; , which enth@@ used audi@@ ences this past Spring , the L@@ ieder@@ kran@@ z will b@@ less two church services with the performance of Franz Schu@@ bert &apos;s Deutsche Messe , to close its anniversary year celebrations .
On Saturday 26 October , this exceptional mass will be heard from 7@@ .00 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Marin@@ us@@ kirche Dun@@ n@@ ingen and on Sunday 27 October , from 10.@@ 15 , at the service in the St. Johannes B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st@@ kirche in L@@ ack@@ endor@@ f .
The so-called &apos; German M@@ ass &apos; , with the original title &quot; Ges@@ änge zur Fei@@ er des hei@@ li@@ ges Opf@@ ers der Messe &quot; ( Songs to celebrate the hol@@ y sacrifice of the mass ) , D 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schu@@ bert , dating from 18@@ 26 , at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary .
Pat@@ ron Joh@@ an Phili@@ pp Ne@@ um@@ ann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services .
Under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Her@@ mann Schnei@@ der , the cho@@ ir will be accompanied by the wind ens@@ emble of the Fro@@ h@@ sinn Tenn@@ en@@ bron@@ n Music Society , and by No@@ em@@ i Lok@@ o@@ di on the organ .
Has@@ la@@ ch : Sc@@ ep@@ ticism vi@@ sibly gives way to confidence
The 2015 Par@@ ish Council elections will bring about fundamental change , for example in the Has@@ la@@ ch Past@@ oral Care Unit ( Seel@@ sorge@@ einheit Has@@ la@@ ch , SE ) .
There will then only be one joint Par@@ ish Council for all six par@@ ishes .
In a joint meeting on Saturday , the committees from Has@@ la@@ ch , Hof@@ st@@ etten , M@@ üh@@ len@@ bach , Fischer@@ bach , Stein@@ ach and Wel@@ sch@@ enst@@ ein@@ ach prepared for the changes .
This is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the dio@@ c@@ ese and it is up to the Par@@ ish Coun@@ cils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible .
During the course of the day one thing became particularly clear : the scep@@ ticism towards the new system is reluc@@ t@@ antly yet vi@@ sibly giving way to confidence .
The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-@@ time members of the past@@ oral care team addressed topics ranging from perc@@ ep@@ tions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms , to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Par@@ ish Council .
Regional D@@ ean Georg Sch@@ mit@@ t explained the newly dra@@ wn@@ -up guidelines for past@@ oral care units in the arch@@ -@@ dio@@ c@@ ese of Freiburg with the help of a presentation .
According to the guidelines , the SE Has@@ la@@ ch , as a church community , will be a cor@@ poration under public law , which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
There will then only be one joint Par@@ ish Council and a Foundation Council , in which the rec@@ tor will be represented by virtue of his office .
From each parish , at least two elected members are to be represented , with so-called church community teams set up on-site in the six par@@ ishes .
In future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis .
Regarding the issue of the finances of the individual par@@ ishes , the need for extensive discussion became evident .
The reforms plan for the accum@@ ulated assets in the par@@ ishes to be retained for a specified purpose .
Ac@@ counts pay@@ able , on the other hand , will be passed over to the &quot; church community &quot; as a whole .
In particular , planned major investments , the debts from which thus affect all par@@ ishes , were cause for great concern .
&quot; In the past , investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual par@@ ishes by themselves , &quot; said Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s Par@@ ish Council Chairman Brun@@ o Prin@@ z@@ bach .
Bar@@ bar Rit@@ ter , Chair of the Committee in the Sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ Neu@@ ried past@@ oral care unit , has practical experience of a joint committee for five par@@ ishes .
In 2006 she set herself the task , &quot; Bec@@ ome one , remain five &quot; and came to realise that the task is really not that simple .
The Comm@@ it@@ tees of the Has@@ la@@ ch past@@ oral care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Par@@ ish Council , and the practical work of the church community teams .
The specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring .
At the end , Par@@ ish Coun@@ s@@ ell@@ or Michael Schön@@ er from Stein@@ ach presented the new logo of the past@@ oral care unit , which was agreed on by a clear majority .
Electri@@ city to become more expensive in P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f
The citizens of P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will have to adjust to high electricity costs .
As Managing Director of the municipal energy company , J@@ ör@@ g-@@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as , confirmed to the S@@ Ü@@ D@@ K@@ UR@@ I@@ ER , families of four in P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year .
One major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called EEC Lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 C@@ ents per ki@@ low@@ att hour .
This lev@@ y will be re@@ set by the four operators of the large power gri@@ ds , in October of each year .
They estimate the additional costs they will inc@@ ur as a result of the &quot; energy turn@@ around &quot; , which they will be able to recover by means of a lev@@ y on the price of electricity .
The P@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f municipal energy company forms the last link in this chain .
In its projec@@ tions , the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a lev@@ y higher than that reported by J@@ ör@@ g-@@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as .
The specific figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy c@@ mp@@ any can inform its customers of the precise price increase next week .
&quot; We are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said Bi@@ as , with the figure likely to be closer to 2 c@@ ents .
Traff@@ ic lights permanently red : observe waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light simply never turns green .
The contact loop on the road does not react , or the light itself is def@@ ective .
What should you do - drive through on red ?
If an affected person has wa@@ ited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light , and provided the crossing is clear , they can drive on , explained Stuttgar@@ t-@@ based lawyer R@@ al@@ f Bec@@ ker in &quot; Motor@@ rad &quot; ( Motor@@ cycle ) magazine .
The waiting time must , however , be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which can be interpreted differently on a cas@@ e-@@ to-@@ case basis .
Bec@@ ker adv@@ ises that you wait at least five minutes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed .
Anyone who drives on in spite of a red light must , however , be aware that he / she will be fully liable for any resulting accident .
Anyone who wa@@ its for less than five minutes has , under certain circumstances , not wa@@ ited long enough , warned Bec@@ ker , referring to a ruling of the Ham@@ m High@@ er Regional Court .
In the case in question , a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three minutes and and was held responsible for neg@@ lig@@ ently j@@ umping a red light .
The traffic lights were actually not def@@ ective , but rather turned green just a few minutes later .
He was sp@@ ared a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not sp@@ ared a fine .
Town Council delighted with solid budget
Every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget , Mayor R@@ al@@ ph Ger@@ ster has good reason to s@@ mile .
The municipality co@@ ff@@ ers in Her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen-@@ Schön@@ ach are well sto@@ cked and the administration has been deb@@ t-@@ free since 2005 .
In this sense , this the 2012 budgetary year , can also be recorded as a complete success .
This became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
As Andrea Roth@@ mund explained , the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned , at around 7.@@ 6 million Euro .
The administrative budget surplus , at around EUR 1.@@ 8 million , also stood at around EUR one million above projec@@ tions .
The surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax .
The capital budget also stood well above the projec@@ ted values .
Instead of the projec@@ ted EUR 1.5 million Euro , the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million .
&quot; This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , &quot; said Roth@@ mund .
Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned , the reserves also came in higher .
In total , they managed to increase the general contin@@ gency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million , to a total of EUR 4.@@ 9 million .
Mayor R@@ al@@ ph Ger@@ ster than@@ ked Roth@@ mund and its team for the good work .
&quot; A job like this is not something you achieve overnight , &quot; said Ger@@ ster in praise of the annual financial statement .
He and the Town Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors are clearly delighted with the good figures .
It may sound like a parado@@ x , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens .
In the past , a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates .
However , according to Ger@@ ster , from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state .
There are prerequi@@ sites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements .
Among other requirements , the towns and municip@@ alities applying for the subsidies must lev@@ y certain municipal rates .
&quot; We have to address the subject of municipal rates , as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies , &quot; comm@@ ented Ger@@ ster regarding this matter .
Nag@@ old : Hu@@ go Wer@@ m@@ ter - a cho@@ ir member for 60 years
Having been a singer for 60 years , Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter &apos;s story with the C@@ ä@@ ci@@ lia Male Ch@@ oral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Aut@@ umn Festival , during which he was cerem@@ oni@@ ally hon@@ oured .
As per usual , Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice cho@@ ir .
Even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the cho@@ ir , which has achieved much more than popularity during this period .
Wer@@ m@@ ter has also been active within the association , serving as a member of the committee for 28 years , among other roles .
For his commitment and loyalty to the organisation , he has also received several awards : J@@ ör@@ g Koh@@ r , La@@ y Past@@ or acting on behalf of the C@@ ä@@ ci@@ lian Association of Rot@@ ten@@ burg-@@ Stuttgart , presented him with an Association Certi@@ fic@@ ate and a letter of comm@@ end@@ ation signed by Bis@@ hop Geb@@ hard Für@@ st - the cho@@ ir also serves as a church cho@@ ir .
His cho@@ ir colleagues presented him with a German Ch@@ oral Association certificate and an en@@ gra@@ ved pe@@ w@@ ter plate .
A@@ side from hon@@ ouring Hu@@ go , the 3@@ 1st Aut@@ umn Festival pro@@ gres@@ sed as usual : Al@@ ongside the Bet@@ ra Male Vo@@ ice Cho@@ ir , the Salz@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ oral Club , the Ba@@ is@@ ingen Ch@@ oral Division and the Local Music Society , the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen sing@@ ers delivered a colourful blend of different ch@@ oral and song styles , which enter@@ tained the 400 or so visitors .
The Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Male Vo@@ ice Cho@@ ir got things running with atmosp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; Im Wein@@ para@@ dies &quot; and &quot; L@@ us@@ tig , ihr Brüder &quot; .
They had also prepared a short ser@@ en@@ ade as a tribute to their hon@@ or@@ ary singer Hu@@ bert Wer@@ m@@ ter - Wolfgang Ama@@ de@@ us Mozart &apos;s &quot; Bundes@@ lied &quot; .
The Bet@@ ra Male Vo@@ ice Cho@@ ir also s@@ ang classic ch@@ oral pieces such as &quot; Jä@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben &quot; by Juli@@ us W@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; W@@ eit , weit weg &quot; by Hu@@ bert Go@@ is@@ ern and the folk song &quot; Wann du durch@@ geh@@ st durch@@ s Tal &quot; .
With its mixed cho@@ ir and its ladies &apos; ens@@ emble - the &quot; Impul@@ sch@@ or &quot; ( Impulse Cho@@ ir ) , the Salz@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ oral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival .
The mixed cho@@ ir carried listen@@ ers away to foreign lands with the Ne@@ a@@ politan fol@@ k@@ songs &quot; Santa Lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; E@@ vi@@ va Esp@@ ana &quot; by An@@ tos G@@ us , while the &quot; Impul@@ sch@@ or &quot; also drew on foreign languages : &quot; Liber@@ ati@@ o &quot; and &quot; H@@ ey Ju@@ de &quot; were included on their programme .
The Ch@@ oral Division of the Ba@@ is@@ ingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with &quot; Was isch der Schw@@ ob ? &quot; by Hans Sü@@ ss@@ mu@@ th and Robert Pap@@ per@@ t &apos;s &quot; Bier@@ lied &quot; , while the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Music Society provided the cro@@ wn@@ ing musical conclusion .
For children , there was a small au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary programme - &quot; O@@ ma Han@@ ne &quot; ( Gr@@ and@@ ma Han@@ ne ) , a.@@ k@@ .@@ a H@@ ann@@ el@@ ore St@@ oll@@ stei@@ mer , performed a &apos; Kas@@ per@@ l &apos; theater ( similar to Pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy ) and read some stories , which kept the children enter@@ tained throughout the afternoon .

Ken@@ yan press ou@@ tra@@ ged at controversial media law
&quot; It is a fri@@ gh@@ tening place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply swe@@ eping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as un@@ constitutional .
&quot; This law is dra@@ con@@ ian and very p@@ uni@@ tive and we reject it , &quot; said Cy@@ rus Kam@@ au , managing director for Capital Group - home to Cap@@ ital@@ F@@ M , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
He said the new media tri@@ bunal &quot; will always be bi@@ ased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MP@@ s , &quot; he said .
According to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a stran@@ gle@@ hold over the media , &quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot; dealt a major blow &quot; and lam@@ ba@@ sted the bill as &quot; dra@@ con@@ ian . &quot;
The passing of the bill comes am@@ id a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islam@@ ist gun@@ men on the West@@ gate shopping m@@ all .
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera foot@@ age of troops who were dispat@@ ched to the scene of the attack pur@@ porte@@ dly rob@@ bing the up@@ market m@@ all .
Police chief David K@@ ima@@ i@@ yo re@@ acted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for ques@@ tioning , although the sum@@ mon@@ s was re@@ trac@@ ted following a media out@@ c@@ ry .
Under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Ken@@ yan shi@@ ll@@ ings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de-@@ listed , &quot; or bar@@ red from receiving official press accredi@@ tation .
The tri@@ bunal also has the power to sei@@ ze the property of an off@@ ender if a fine is not paid .
According to the Da@@ ily Nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to cri@@ pp@@ le most F@@ M stations . &quot;
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively blo@@ go@@ sphere . &quot;
By si@@ len@@ cing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with imp@@ unity .
&quot; No one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journalist Mut@@ uma Ma@@ thi@@ u , descri@@ bing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .
&quot; Left to themselves , politicians would bank@@ rupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , &quot; he wrote .
Ken@@ yan law@@ makers have been the target of public anger in the past .
In May they voted to over@@ turn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and re@@ inst@@ ate their hef@@ ty salaries of around 5@@ 32@@ ,000 shi@@ ll@@ ings a month tax@@ -@@ free - ran@@ ked among the highest in the world .
Bad@@ -@@ Dür@@ r@@ heim : A dream comes true for the FC

This was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony , as well as for a number of speakers .
Thus , FC Chairman Al@@ bre@@ cht Sch@@ len@@ ker , who spoke of the fulfil@@ ment of a dream , also got fairly wet .
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Kl@@ ump@@ p , who was heavily involved in the re@@ alisation of the project , the Town Council , the companies involved and club members who played a part .
Partic@@ ular mention went out to Lo@@ th@@ ar H@@ eld , Paul Wei@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger , H@@ einer G@@ ail and Peter Gra@@ f .
The sp@@ ry pension@@ ers laid 400 square metres of fla@@ gging for the new paths .
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also hon@@ oured by Member of the State Parliament , Karl Rom@@ bach .
Further words of gre@@ eting were issued to the town Sports Commissioner , Hu@@ bert Ba@@ ier , the District Chair@@ person of the Southern Baden Foot@@ ball Association , Kun@@ o Ka@@ yan , and Friedrich K@@ nor@@ r from the planning office , who announced a donation to the club &apos;s youth division .
Mayor Kl@@ ump@@ p rec@@ alled that we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ related influences in the Spring and Aut@@ umn had repeatedly aff@@ lic@@ ted the original sports field , to such an extent that it could not be played on .
It was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered , when the construction of a third pit@@ ch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Sal@@ inen@@ see Lake were considered .
Both ideas were rejected .
Six years ago , thoughts turned to laying an ast@@ ro-@@ tur@@ f pit@@ ch , which was generally viewed as the perfect solution .
Speci@@ fic plans were drawn up two years ago , when the FC inher@@ ited the Sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in le@@ as@@ ehold , promised a contribution of EUR 100@@ ,000 for the construction of the pit@@ ch and the state approved a sub@@ sidy of EUR 10@@ 4@@ ,000 .
In October 2012 , the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 35@@ 6@@ ,000 of the total cost of EUR 5@@ 60@@ ,000 , sum@@ mar@@ ised Kl@@ ump@@ p .
Work began on the 68 x 108 met@@ re ast@@ ro-@@ tur@@ f pit@@ ch on 4 June .
During the construction phase , which la@@ sted over three months , 3@@ ,000 c@@ ub@@ ic metres of earth were removed , of which half was used for the laying of a di@@ rt bike track .
Union and SP@@ D have continued their coalition negotiations , addressing the topics of internal affairs and justice .
To this end , the competent working group met this morning .
Among other issues , topics discussed included direct democracy , the bri@@ ber@@ y of MP@@ s and the Federal Police .
During the morning , the Migration and Integration working group also sought to continue its discussions .
Among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nationality , in which regard both sides have opposing ideas .
The SP@@ D would like to put an end to the pressure placed on imm@@ igrant children to decide on one nationality - the Union re@@ jects the notion of a dual passport .
Regarding the subject of traffic , which was not on the agenda for this Friday , the SP@@ D substanti@@ ated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CS@@ U .
A toll road sti@@ cker would amount to a &quot; flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counter@@ productive , &quot; explained the SP@@ D negoti@@ ator for issues relating to traffic , Flori@@ an P@@ ron@@ old , in a letter to his parliamentary group .
There would be a threat of diver@@ ted traffic on country roads , which are already accident hot@@ spots .
The introduction of a toll for cars would also only be a first step , in P@@ ron@@ old &apos;s eyes .
&quot; There is the risk that the compensation for Germans would be abolished at a later point in time , &quot; he said .
Di@@ eter Thomas Ku@@ hn in Stuttgart : The &quot; singing mountain wave &quot; on the open-@@ air stage
Stuttgart - &quot; When will it be summer again ? &quot; was actually not the question on people &apos;s li@@ ps at the K@@ ill@@ es@@ berg Open@@ -@@ Air Theatre on Friday evening .
It genuinely was a tropical evening in Stuttgart .
This therefore provided the ideal conditions for pop star , Di@@ eter Thomas Ku@@ hn , and his band .

Car driver seriously injured in accident
A 3@@ 7-@@ year-old car driver from A@@ achen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening .
According to information from the police , a 4@@ 1-@@ year-old from Mü@@ sch was travelling in his car on the K@@ emp@@ ener b@@ yp@@ ass in the direction of Gre@@ fr@@ ath , at around 9.@@ 15 p.m ..
As he went to turn right onto St. T@@ ön@@ iser Straße he failed to see the 3@@ 7-@@ year-old &apos;s on@@ coming vehicle .
The vehicles col@@ li@@ ded .
The A@@ achen resident suffered serious inj@@ uries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment .
Kon@@ stanz : Road block following accident on the Sch@@ än@@ z@@ le round@@ about
According to police , the accident occurred when a 5@@ 1-@@ year-old driver of a Swiss Se@@ at Ibiza was travelling out of town in the left lane of the two-@@ lane Rei@@ chen@@ au@@ strasse .
Shor@@ tly before the Sch@@ än@@ z@@ le round@@ about he noticed that was in the left-@@ turn lane going in the direction of Stro@@ me@@ y@@ ers@@ dor@@ f@@ straße and moved across to the right lane .
In so doing , he col@@ li@@ ded with the BMW of a 23@@ -@@ year-old Kon@@ stanz resident , travelling in that lane .
The V@@ W Pass@@ at of a 19@@ -@@ year-old driver travelling behind the BMW was also damaged .
In total , EUR 15@@ ,000 of material damage was caused , announced the police .
The road had to be blocked off while the accident was being investigated , the statement continued .
Vienna Airport aboli@@ shes passenger call@@ -@@ outs
Mr. Max Ma@@ ier , please make your way to Gate 24 .
In future , announ@@ cements such as this will no longer happen at Vienna International Airport .
The majority of lou@@ d@@ speaker announ@@ cements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level .
The goal of this adjustment is to create a more relaxing atmosphere .
As airport spo@@ kes@@ person Peter Kle@@ em@@ an announced to Radio Vienna that in adju@@ sting the approach towards announ@@ cements , Vienna Airport is following an international trend .
Among others , the airports in Kopenhagen , Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call@@ -@@ outs .
By doing away with these announ@@ cements - on average around 200 personal call@@ -@@ outs come through the lou@@ d@@ speakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be cal@@ mer in future .
&quot; Experience has also shown that these individual announ@@ cements are relatively sel@@ dom taken notice of , and at the same time , all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them , &quot; said Kle@@ em@@ an while chat@@ ting to the radio broad@@ cast@@ er .
High@@ land Games in Kal@@ ten@@ hof
Al@@ ongside bra@@ ke van pul@@ ling with trac@@ tors , there will also be a second contest at the agricultural autumn festival at Kal@@ ten@@ hof from 6 to 8 September .
On Saturday 7 September , the High@@ land Games will start at 1 : 30 p.m .
While they are of course a Scottish tradition , they have been given a touch of Sw@@ ab@@ ian colour at the Kal@@ ten@@ hof event grounds .
Teams and individual competitors will be pit@@ ted against one another in the discipl@@ ines of to@@ ss@@ ing the c@@ aber , hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e to@@ ss@@ ing and bu@@ cket carrying .
The c@@ aber is four and a half metres long and weigh@@ s 25 to 30 kilometres .
&quot; It isn &apos;t about the distance , &quot; explains organis@@ er Peter Sa@@ ile .
The log must be thrown ver@@ tically , som@@ ers@@ ault once and then finish lying straight .
This scores maximum points .
In to@@ ss@@ ing the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , it all comes down to accuracy .
Hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es are thrown onto a pe@@ g from a distance of eight metres .
Particip@@ ants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bu@@ cket of water 50 metres .
Time is recorded and water quantity measured in a v@@ at at the end .
Two members of each &quot; cl@@ an &quot; or team can then take part in the individual competition .
The winners of the team and individual con@@ tests receive prizes .
Teams can practice from 10 : 00 a.m .
Su@@ itable clothing is desirable - for example competitors can wear kil@@ ts .
However , Sw@@ ab@@ ian traditional clothing is also permitted .
The jud@@ ging panel will also award a few bonus points for &quot; out@@ fits &quot; .
Regi@@ stration is open until a few hours prior to the beginning of the competition .
With the Scot@@ ti@@ sh@@ -S@@ w@@ ab@@ ian High@@ land Games and the trac@@ tor pul@@ ling contest , which will begin half an hour be@@ fore@@ hand , there promises to be a great deal of action at the event grounds on Saturday .
In the evening , fans of bra@@ ss band music will be in for a treat of their own .
At 19 : 00 , the &quot; bi@@ rab@@ öh@@ mische &quot; ( a play on words all@@ u@@ ding to the regions pe@@ ar trees , Boh@@ em@@ ia , and perhaps their love of beer as well ! ) wind music group from Schö@@ m@@ berg , provide a great evening of entertainment .
The band plays lively pol@@ kas and mar@@ ches .
However , their re@@ pertoire also includes emo@@ tive wal@@ tz@@ es and a full big band sound .
Hein@@ z Ko@@ ch from Wei@@ len unter den R@@ innen will also be there , better known as the &apos; singing inn keep@@ er and black s@@ aus@@ age bar@@ on &quot; .
In the past , he has appeared at the Christmas market in Dor@@ n@@ han and the Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft ( F@@ ool &apos;s Guil@@ d event ) .
On Sunday , the L@@ ein@@ st@@ etten Music Society will enter@@ tain audi@@ ences with a morning session , with the B@@ öff@@ ingen Far@@ mer &apos;s Band as guests from 2 : 00 p.m. , and then the &quot; Ol@@ dies &quot; will bring the celebrations to a close .
The celebrations will get under way on Friday , with the &quot; St@@ oppel@@ ack@@ er &quot; ( Stub@@ ble Fiel@@ d ) party featuring DJ R@@ al@@ f .
Other items in the itiner@@ ary on Saturday and Sunday include the vin@@ tage car and trac@@ tor meet and exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry .
Further attractions on Sunday are the cor@@ n ma@@ ze , the craft market and sheep sh@@ ear@@ ing .
Speci@@ ally for children , there is a pet@@ ting zo@@ o , &quot; stra@@ w bo@@ un@@ cy castle &quot; , trac@@ tor driving ( under supervision ) and trac@@ tor surfing .
The event is organised by the community hall association , the ski club and the &quot; Z@@ ünd@@ kap@@ sel@@ e &quot; ( b@@ lasting cap@@ s ) trac@@ tor enthusiasts .
An overview of milk and egg alternatives
Veg@@ an nutrition promotes vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
Mas@@ hed to@@ fu with plant cream , for example , serves as a substitute for quar@@ k cheese .
The Veget@@ arian Association will provide further examples on World Veg@@ an Day on 1 November .
On the occasion of World v@@ eg@@ an Day on 1 November , the Veget@@ arian Association of Germany will propose a host of v@@ eg@@ an alternatives :
P@@ ure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , while yo@@ gh@@ urt can be replaced by so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ urt .
So@@ ya , o@@ at , al@@ mond or rice milk can be used in place of milk .
Pl@@ ant whi@@ pping cream can replace traditional whi@@ pping cream .
There are also plant alternatives to eggs .
Hal@@ f a mas@@ hed , ri@@ pe banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
50 gram@@ s of app@@ le sau@@ ce or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ground lin@@ seed plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are also suitable .
A d@@ ough becomes flu@@ ff@@ y by replacing egg with a mixture of one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of b@@ aking powder , one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of corn@@ fl@@ our and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of mineral water , for example .
50 gram@@ s of so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ urt or sil@@ ken to@@ fu can also fulfil this purpose .
According to information from the Veget@@ arian Association , around 800@@ ,000 Germans currently have a v@@ eg@@ an diet , i.e. a 100 % vegetable diet .
Sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in New York
On the way to their host families in We@@ y@@ mouth , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , the pupils of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald Gra@@ mm@@ ar School got to know the American city of New York .
After an eigh@@ t-@@ hour flight , they headed straight for Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn Bridge , via which the heart of the city , Manhattan , can be reached on foot .
From here there is a fascinating view of the world-@@ famous sky@@ line , which is particularly impressive in the evening light .
Due to the time difference , the pupils had been on the go for almost 24 hours , however , true to the s@@ logan , &quot; the city never sle@@ ep@@ s &quot; , the day was rounded off with a trip to Times Square .
In spite of a sh@@ ut@@ down , they were able to visit the Stat@@ ue of Liber@@ ty on the second day , and climb the stat@@ ue on foot .
They then moved on to the Financial District , via Wall Street , to visit the 9 / 11 mem@@ orial .
On the third day , the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building , enjoying the views from a height of 3@@ 73 metres .
They then made their way through the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle of the New York streets , via the Ro@@ cker@@ f@@ eller Center , to Central Park , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Aut@@ umn sun .
Following a short flight from New York to Boston , the pupils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at We@@ y@@ mouth High School .
Once again this year , on Saint Hu@@ bert &apos;s day , a Hu@@ bert mass will be celebrated in the Par@@ ish of St. Mari@@ en on H@@ ül@@ s@@ berg@@ strasse .
St. Hu@@ bert was , according to legend , a truly ru@@ th@@ less h@@ unter , who converted following a vision and was later appointed Bis@@ hop of L@@ üt@@ ti@@ ch .
Hun@@ ting horn group &quot; Jag@@ dre@@ iter West@@ f@@ alen &quot; , under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Klu@@ th , played old , traditional French mel@@ o@@ dies on par@@ force hor@@ ns ( natural hor@@ ns in the key of E flat ) .
The wind players wear riding clothes , as they provide musical accompan@@ im@@ ent mainly for ri@@ ders , horses and p@@ acks of ho@@ unds on drag hun@@ ts .
The sol@@ em@@ n mass is to take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.@@ 30 a.m .
The newly designed Op@@ schlag stands out with a new café .
One that invites you to ling@@ er a while and to come again .
One that wants to get its name out there .
According to dic@@ tion@@ aries , dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is defined as a psychological phenomenon , which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation .
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Op@@ schlag in Kle@@ ve County , with a view of the Rhein@@ -@@ Wa@@ al University , it doesn &apos;t always have to remain a pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , this is precisely the aim of the café with the wonderful name : to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recur@@ ring basis , not just theore@@ tically , but tan@@ gi@@ bly .
Because it is fun and simply beautiful .
A gl@@ ance into the internal work@@ ings at Op@@ schlag 8 gives the on@@ lo@@ ok@@ er a positive feeling right from the outset .
With its ultra-@@ modern yet cosy café ambience , it looks like a place designed to make you feel good .
The team here , with business fo@@ under@@ s , Mir@@ j@@ am van der St@@ elt and Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner at the hel@@ m , spo@@ ils guests with a wide range of coffe@@ es and cocktails .
In addition to this , there are delicious c@@ akes or fresh@@ ly bak@@ ed bag@@ u@@ ettes , filled to order .
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves as restau@@ r@@ ate@@ urs prior to opening the ch@@ ic café on the Op@@ schlag : They previously managed the &quot; Art Lounge &quot; in K@@ ran@@ enburg .
By moving to Kle@@ ve on the Op@@ schlag , the friendly café lovers hope to reach a wider audience .
Not least through university customers .
&quot; We don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; emphasises Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner .
In actual fact , here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age bra@@ ckets .
Spe@@ aking of café lovers ...
The two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee .
They themselves enjoy the fra@@ grant , hot bre@@ w in a var@@ iet of formats .
Esp@@ res@@ so fan
Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner is more of an es@@ pres@@ so fan , while Mir@@ j@@ am van der St@@ elt is the c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; And a bag@@ u@@ ette with it - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she revealed to the N@@ R@@ Z .
There have already been two events held in the brigh@@ tly lit café .
Or perhaps more accurately , one .
This is because the Hafen@@ fest took place more outside than in - Café Dé@@ j@@ à V@@ u did not benefit from it .
However , there was also the Ring@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
The two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ olds found it &quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; .
But it was not for everyone .
Perhaps this is why Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner is not a vocal fan of evening events : &quot; You just cannot please everyone &quot; .
And with an event , I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special event .
For this reason , events will always be an exception to the rule for us .
&quot; We want to cause as little dis@@ ruption as possible to normal business &quot; .
That is to say : Dé@@ j@@ à V@@ u also stands for reliability .
This is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the Op@@ schlag in Kle@@ ve .
The street that is fast becoming a &apos; restaurant mile &apos; .
This is to the delight of many Kle@@ ve residents , guests from near and far and the students who are discovering the &apos; restaurant mile &apos; , and with it the Café Dé@@ j@@ à V@@ u , for themselves .

A day of thanks with the M@@ G@@ V ( Male Ch@@ oral Society ) in D@@ in@@ ker
This year the &quot; Friedrich Wilhelm D@@ in@@ ker &quot; M@@ G@@ V issued an invitation to its 16@@ 5th anniversary celebration , which 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves were happy to accept .
In the clu@@ b@@ house at the &quot; Wit@@ te@@ borg &quot; Inn in D@@ in@@ ker , all those present enjoyed the friendly get@@ -@@ together in the name of music .
Tradi@@ tionally , the anniversary celebration is also always the fitting occasion to be@@ sto@@ w hon@@ ours .
This time around , secre@@ tary Rol@@ f W@@ agen@@ er was delighted to receive the special &quot; Sing@@ er of the Year &quot; award .
&quot; Not only have you kept countless records for us , but you have also done so much running around for us , and for this we offer our sincere thanks , &quot; said Cho@@ ir Chairman E@@ rich Sch@@ lot@@ mann .
The awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als by means of the presentation of &quot; activity posi@@ es &quot; , this year went to Cho@@ ir Director Di@@ eter Schul@@ ze , with 44 atten@@ dance marks , followed by Hon@@ or@@ ary Chairman Hor@@ st Pier@@ -@@ Ri@@ b@@ bert , the Chairman himself , and last year &apos;s &quot; Sing@@ er of the Year &quot; Friedrich Win@@ kler , each having attended 42 times .
Fif@@ th place went to Ar@@ tur Br@@ ück@@ ner , responsible for organising music copies .
The Board of Directors gave special thanks to the team managed by inn@@ keep@@ er , An@@ ge Pier@@ -@@ Ri@@ b@@ bert , which once again delighted those present with a top class menu , and to Ger@@ da Pier@@ -@@ Ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ations .
The &quot; Friedrich@@ -@@ Wilhelm &quot; M@@ G@@ V meets for its regular cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als in the clu@@ b@@ house every Tuesday at 19 : 45 .
&quot; New voices that love to sing are more than welcome any time , &quot; said Sch@@ lot@@ mann .
UN ha@@ ils new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millenni@@ um development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
Australian diplom@@ ats played a key role in pushing for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the MD@@ G@@ s , which exp@@ ire in 2015 , ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Jan@@ eiro overnight .
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms G@@ ill@@ ard during the summit .
UN Secretary-General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SD@@ G@@ s , &quot; he said .
These SD@@ G@@ s will build on our advances under the millenni@@ um development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MD@@ G@@ s .
Even though the S@@ G Ach@@ im / Baden has gone four match days without victory , a positive mood is still prev@@ ailing within the top flight hand@@ ball team .
Trainer Tom@@ as@@ z Mal@@ mon will not let there be any doubt of this fact .
Everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand .
That said , I do hope that we finally start winning again .
&quot; I no longer remember how a victory like that tastes , &quot; said Mal@@ mon , anticip@@ ating success for his team at V@@ f@@ L Fre@@ den@@ beck II .
Even though the third-@@ tier reserves from Fre@@ den@@ beck are no &apos;t exactly in the best form at the moment , Mal@@ mon has issued a warning in advance
I trained many of the players myself in the A-@@ Youth .
Consequently , they will be particularly motivated playing against their former coach .
&quot; In addition , we will have to wait and see whether rein@@ for@@ cements from the first team will be there , &quot; explained the S@@ G coach .
In any case , if they are to finally get back on the winning track , Mal@@ mon &apos;s team will have to improve on recent performances .
There have been major problems , primarily in terms of covering and counter att@@ acking .
The team &apos;s eye for the goal must be considerably improved .
Therefore , I hope that my players have finally managed to clear their heads during the short break .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que security concerns mount as powerful person@@ alities clas@@ h
With a stat@@ ue of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s founding president , star@@ ing down on them , thousands of people gathered in central Map@@ u@@ to to chant peace slo@@ gans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; We want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said Van@@ ess@@ a de S@@ ous@@ a , chief executive of an investment company .
F@@ ear@@ ful about the future of her country , she sw@@ apped her corporate atti@@ re for a T-@@ shirt emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned with &quot; we demand security &quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crow@@ ds in the capital &apos;s Inde@@ pendence Square on Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clas@@ hes between government forces and Ren@@ amo , some of the worst sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
Ren@@ amo was once a not@@ orious re@@ bel movement , initially backed by wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ruled R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia and then South Africa &apos;s apar@@ thei@@ d government as part of efforts to destabili@@ se the country &apos;s independent government .
After a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
An@@ alyst@@ s believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and locals .
The st@@ akes are high for the fast@@ -@@ growing economy as the discovery of huge off@@ shore gas reserves and coal deposits in the nor@@ thwest could bring in more than $ 50@@ bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio T@@ into , V@@ ale of Brazil , En@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ark@@ o of the US .
The ruling Fre@@ lim@@ o party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and Ren@@ amo blame each other for the tension .
Ren@@ amo says the government initiated the latest clas@@ hes by launching an attack on its members in So@@ fal@@ a province , traditionally a Ren@@ amo stron@@ gh@@ old , on October 17 .
Ass@@ aults on the former reb@@ els then escal@@ ated as government forces attacked Ren@@ amo bases and attempted to kill Af@@ on@@ so D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the group &apos;s leader , Fern@@ ando Maz@@ an@@ ga , Ren@@ amo &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man , told the Financial Times .
The government bl@@ ames Ren@@ amo for trig@@ gering the clas@@ hes , acc@@ using it of att@@ acking soldiers .
President Ar@@ mand@@ o Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to play down concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told AF@@ P , the French news agency , on Wednesday that Mr D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;
Both Fre@@ lim@@ o and Ren@@ amo insist they want to avoid war .
But concerns have grown after Mr Maz@@ an@@ ga was quoted as saying Ren@@ amo was aband@@ oning the 1992 peace acc@@ ord .
He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Fre@@ lim@@ o .
&quot; Our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seri@@ ousness , &quot; Mr Maz@@ an@@ ga said .
Pre@@ vious talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fu@@ elled by a series of clas@@ hes this year .
&quot; It &apos;s two big men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) but@@ ting heads together , &quot; said Joseph Han@@ lon , a lec@@ tur@@ er at the Open University and Moz@@ ambi@@ que expert .
Neither of them are good negoti@@ ators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .
Ren@@ amo , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boy@@ cot@@ t municipal elections due in November .
Presiden@@ tial and parliamentary p@@ olls are scheduled for next year .
Some comm@@ ent@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government .
Ren@@ amo &apos;s share of the vote has been dec@@ lining since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , the Democratic Mo@@ vement of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( MD@@ M ) which was formed by a former Ren@@ amo member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Mr Maz@@ an@@ ga says Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; He does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; Mr Maz@@ an@@ ga said .
It is unclear how much capacity Ren@@ amo has , but it has carried out dis@@ rup@@ tive hit@@ -and-@@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-@@ south highway .
Most of the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes have taken place in So@@ fal@@ a province , which is several hundred kilometres north of Map@@ u@@ to , but hosts Bei@@ ra , the port that min@@ ers , including Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale , rely on to export coal .
In June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Ren@@ amo threatened to attack the line .
Mr Maz@@ an@@ ga was co@@ y when asked about whether Ren@@ amo would repeat this threat .
Ren@@ amo wanted to &quot; war@@ n the international community that things were not going well in Moz@@ ambi@@ que , &quot; Mr Maz@@ an@@ ga said .
The instability has added to fru@@ strations with the government , says Fern@@ ando Lim@@ a , head of Medi@@ ac@@ oo@@ p , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of ki@@ dn@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .
O@@ mar Sul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstr@@ ator , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; No one ca@@ res about Ren@@ amo and Fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
Children should be taught my@@ ths and legen@@ ds as &quot; models for a way of life &quot; , author says .
T@@ ales of Th@@ or could show &quot; bru@@ te strength is no match for sub@@ tle tri@@ ck@@ ery , &quot; while the Ar@@ th@@ uri@@ an legen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
Sa@@ ying many of the my@@ ths would be &quot; far too wild , far too scand@@ alous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in schools , &quot; Cro@@ ss@@ le@@ y-@@ Holland advoc@@ ated a &quot; careful selection &quot; of age-@@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ th and fol@@ kl@@ ore already has a part in education , &quot; he said .
I have been advoc@@ ating it as a plan for twenty years .
He added authors and teachers being &quot; over@@ tly did@@ ac@@ tic &quot; is a &quot; total swit@@ ch-@@ off &quot; for children , with messages being &quot; sub@@ limin@@ ated &quot; in enjoyable stories .
Cro@@ ss@@ le@@ y-@@ Holland , who has translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ on as well as writing the Pen@@ gu@@ in Book of Nor@@ se My@@ ths and British Fol@@ k T@@ ales , said : &quot; You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . &quot;
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending , but that there is an inn@@ ate sense of good and evil .

Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob back in Freih@@ of once again
100 years ago , Heinrich Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob moved into his retirement home in Has@@ la@@ ch , on Sunday his final years in the &quot; Freih@@ of &quot; were brought to life .
The large audience was inspired by the extremely am@@ using role play .
From his arrival , to his being confer@@ red with hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship and his death , A@@ lo@@ is Kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k , the scrip@@ tw@@ ri@@ ter and actor portra@@ ying Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob , has written an enter@@ taining play , which received great acc@@ la@@ im under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Cor@@ ne@@ lia Volk .
Mar@@ cus Z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann , serving as nar@@ r@@ ator , guided the audience through the ten different scenes , explained circumstances and provided links expla@@ ining le@@ aps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement .
On 22 October 19@@ 13 , Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob returned home to his childhood paradise , to his Freih@@ of .
It was there that the ro@@ le-@@ play began , with A@@ lo@@ is Kra@@ f@@ c@@ zy@@ k sh@@ ining once again in his famous role as the town &apos;s great son .
Tru@@ e to style , he trav@@ elled with a two-@@ horse carri@@ age drawn by &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ äl@@ der Fü@@ ch@@ sen &quot; ( Black Forest Ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut Hor@@ ses ) owned by E@@ rich Be@@ cher@@ er from M@@ üh@@ len@@ bach .
Not only was he received with great ap@@ plause from the audience , but was also welcomed by his sister Philipp@@ ine .
Bil@@ ly Sum@@ -@@ Her@@ mann managed un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amaz@@ ingly well , in terms of both her expressions and gest@@ ures .
Between the individual scenes , the M@@ üh@@ len@@ b@@ acher Bauern@@ kap@@ elle played appropriately selected musical pieces , thus round@@ ing off the performance .
The honour of presenting the title of hon@@ or@@ ary citizen went to Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s Mayor , Hein@@ z Win@@ kler , who , together with a section of the Town Council , made an appearance representing the Mayor of H@@ üt@@ ti@@ ch from back in Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob &apos;s day .
The &quot; Drei@@ kön@@ ig &quot; sing@@ ers then made their own appearance , leading Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob to exc@@ la@@ im : &quot; O@@ h how beautiful , this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Drei@@ kön@@ ig group back to life &quot; .
With their song , &quot; O Jes@@ ul@@ ein &quot; , they delighted the audience in the Freih@@ of , as did the &quot; Stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der &quot; with their loud cri@@ es of &quot; Her@@ aus , Her@@ aus &quot; .
In his day , Hans@@ j@@ ak@@ ob expressed his criticism of the institutional church , as well as his concerns regarding the exc@@ esses in the rural economy , the consequences of industri@@ alisation and the effects of the war .
He found his place of rest on his native soil , behind his m@@ aus@@ ole@@ um on the Brand near Hof@@ st@@ etten .
The ro@@ le-@@ play ended with the words &quot; A rest@@ less spirit finally found rest and returned home forever &quot; .
The performance received great ap@@ plause and many words of praise from the audience .
Bas@@ ketball : Hop@@ es are growing for the N@@ eck@@ ar Ri@@ esen ( N@@ eck@@ ar Gi@@ ants ) .
The chances of the re@@ leg@@ ated Lud@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg Bu@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ketball players remaining in the le@@ ague have improved .
This is because there is to be a wild card procedure , and the N@@ eck@@ ar Ri@@ esen are now up against one applicant fewer .
The Hamburg To@@ wers bas@@ ketball project is dec@@ lining to make an application for a possible stand@@ -in place .
&quot; We will not participate in the wild card process , &quot; said former national team player Pas@@ cal Rol@@ ler , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the H@@ ansa town since 2012 .
However , there was no si@@ gh of relief to be heard from Lud@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg .
&quot; We are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that Düsseldorf is not receiving a licence , &quot; said bo@@ ss of the N@@ eck@@ ar Ri@@ esen Alexander Rei@@ l , speaking to our paper .
New@@ ly promoted Düsseldorf Bas@@ k@@ ets have until 23 May to submit documents to the arbit@@ ration panel and prove their financial fitness for the Bundes@@ lig@@ a .
However , the R@@ hin@@ eland team have already been refused the licence twice .
The Court of Ar@@ bit@@ ration is the authority of last resort .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch : Focus on the Abend@@ ma@@ hl@@ sk@@ ir@@ che
As the town &apos;s contribution to the 150@@ th anniversary of the Prote@@ stant Church in Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch , the town &apos;s Office of Culture and Tourism is to dedic@@ ate the last of this year &apos;s public them@@ atic tours on Sunday 27 October to the Abend@@ s@@ ma@@ hl@@ sk@@ ir@@ che ( Church of the Holy Comm@@ union ) .
Following a visit to the Nuclear Bun@@ ker Museum , the focus will turn to Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch in the period after 18@@ 50 , when Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch came under P@@ rus@@ sian rule .
The cro@@ wn@@ ing gl@@ ory will be a visit to the Abend@@ ma@@ hl@@ sk@@ ir@@ che .
There the participants of the tour will be told the story of the construction of the church and will gain insight into the development of the Prote@@ stant con@@ gre@@ gation , in what is a Catholic area through and through .
Last but not least , while in the church eyes will also turn to the last supp@@ er painting , painted by Friedrich Schü@@ z with the support of Walter Kr@@ ö@@ ll and Georg Halb@@ rit@@ ter .
It is a fai@@ thful reproduction of the famous work Leonardo da Vinci in Milan .
The meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is the Nuclear B@@ under Museum , at 3 : 00 p.m .
Tickets are available from the ticket office at the Nuclear Bun@@ ker Museum .
The Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch Town Tourist Office is available for questions and to provide you with information .
Snow@@ den may make further statements in Russia
The former US intelligence expert , Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the US es@@ pi@@ on@@ age scandal from his Russian asylum .
Represent@@ atives of the Federal Pro@@ sec@@ utor could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30-@@ year-old in person in Russia .
This was reported by the Inter@@ fax Agency with reference to groups aware of the situation , which were not named in greater detail .
Such matters are to be clarified at an intergovernmental level , it was stated .
A departure of Snow@@ den from Russia is virtually impossible .
&quot; If this were to happen , he would lose his status as a refugee , &quot; said the Agency , quot@@ ing their source .
Because Germany is an ally of the USA , Snow@@ den would be at risk of de@@ port@@ ation if he were to travel there , the source continued .
En@@ dur@@ ance pays divi@@ den@@ ds
Six teams batt@@ led to become champion at the club tennis tournament .
In the end , it was the en@@ dur@@ ance of the Ma@@ ier / Bron@@ ner team that decided the final match .
The tennis division of the Sport@@ fre@@ unde Rohr@@ dorf ( Rohr@@ dorf Sports Fans ) enjoyed perfect weather for the tournament for local clubs and enthusiasts .
The focus of the tournament was on the fun of playing tennis .
Five matches were scheduled for each team , with every team playing one match against all the others .
The matches were doub@@ les matches with a long set up to nine points , or a maximum duration of 45 minutes .
An@@ ja Sch@@ lich@@ ter managed the tournament
The organisation of the tournament was placed in the tru@@ sty hands of An@@ ja Sch@@ lich@@ ter , who was supported by Carmen Müller and In@@ ga Kron@@ eme@@ yer .
After the first three matches and a lunch break with past@@ a , the tournament moved into the crucial phase .
The favou@@ rites , Andr@@ e Ma@@ ier / Matthias Bron@@ ner , were tied with Michael Kli@@ pp@@ el and Sad@@ min Os@@ mi@@ ci@@ c ( both teams from the S@@ G Rohr@@ wei@@ ler ) , meaning that the last two games had to produce a vic@@ tor .
At the awards ceremony , Carmen Müller finally had the pleasure of presenting the Challenge Cup to Andr@@ e Ma@@ ier and Matthias Bron@@ ner , who had shown the greatest staying power on the final leg .
Second place was taken by the Michael Kli@@ pp@@ el / Sad@@ min Os@@ mi@@ ci@@ c partnership .
Bron@@ ze went to Ra@@ iner and Ber@@ nd Ma@@ ier of the A@@ sp@@ hal@@ tri@@ e@@ cher team .
In the late afternoon sun , accompanied by coffee and ca@@ ke , the tournament drew to a successful close .
On the last weekend in August , the Vo@@ g@@ ts@@ bau@@ ern@@ hof Black Forest Open Air Museum in Gut@@ ach near Hor@@ n@@ berg will once again be firmly in the hands of children .
Tradi@@ tionally , the museum welcomes visitors on a Saturday and Sunday , this year on on 24 and 25 August , to a colourful party for children and families as part of the summer holiday programme , with numerous participation activities and events .
&quot; On both days , adults and children alike can learn various traditional han@@ di@@ crafts , &quot; said the press release .
Whether producing so@@ ap , turning cand@@ les , fel@@ ting or making sil@@ k , there is a suitable activity whatever your age .
The children will receive help from regional arti@@ sans , present from 11.00 a.m. until 5 : 00 p.m .
Acti@@ vities will also be taking place in the museum workshop .
The young guests will be able to demonstrate their manual skills building cu@@ ck@@ oo pi@@ pes , water wheels or sp@@ inning tops .
The host of old games , such as whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row racing or walking on stil@@ ts , promises plenty of fun .
Here speed and coordination are the order of the day .
For any mini@@ ature dete@@ c@@ tives , the open air museum will be offering a myst@@ ery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday , at mid@@ day and 2.@@ 00 p.m. respectively .
On a tour of the premises , the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up .
In addition , visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum on a carri@@ age journey drawn by Black Forest Ch@@ est@@ n@@ ut horses .
It is not just horses that can be found and admi@@ red on the grounds , but many other animals such as sheep , go@@ ats , co@@ ws and chi@@ ck@@ ens as well .
On the Sunday the children will also be able to enjoy the clo@@ wn , O@@ tsch , who will be doing p@@ ranks with the museum guests from 11.00 a.m .
Meanwhile , a cosy and magical alternative will be provided by Her@@ mann Bü@@ t@@ tner .
The stor@@ y-@@ t@@ eller will be taking the younger guests to the wonderful world of fair@@ y@@ tale at 11.00 a.m. , 1 : 00 p.m. and 3 : 00 p.m .
The traditional children &apos;s dance group from Gut@@ ach will also be performing at 11 : 30 a.m .
Furthermore , on both event days , from 11.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m. , numerous arti@@ sans such as the b@@ room maker , the se@@ wer , the sp@@ inner , the we@@ a@@ ver and the bak@@ er will be letting visitors look over their shoul@@ ders .
So , visitors to the open air museum can expect a varied holiday programme right through to the end of the summer holidays in Baden-@@ Wu@@ er@@ ttem@@ berg .
In a small town in New Zealand , Bur@@ t Mun@@ ro is considered a lo@@ vable od@@ d@@ ball , all because he resolved to compete in a race in America with his 1920 motor@@ bike .
In spite of his heart defect , Bur@@ t could not be deter@@ red from pursuing his dream .
With his savings , a few donations and a mort@@ gage on his old workshop , he set off to Los Angeles by ship .
The film will be followed by coffee , tea and ca@@ ke .
Pier@@ cing be@@ ep distur@@ bs residents
R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard has also invested highly in land
They stock@@ pi@@ le the coal that arri@@ ves on ships .
At the same time , the company also has other ir@@ ons in the fire at the location .
Besides coal imports , R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard is also active in the field of wind park logistics , among other vent@@ ures .
The co@@ als shi@@ mmer black in the storage yard in front of the em@@ bank@@ ment .
Here two huge blue st@@ ack@@ er and rec@@ laim@@ er machines distribute or load the co@@ als as required .
With each movement of the handling machines , a sh@@ ri@@ ll warning noise rings out over the site .
&quot; The signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescri@@ bed , &quot; said Matthias Sch@@ rell , Managing Director of R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard in Wilhel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
Unfortunately , in the event of un@@ favourable wind , they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town .
The 40-@@ year-old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected .
In close consultation with the authorities , we are now in a position to make the warning signals qui@@ eter by means of the implementation of technical measures .
In future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours .
For Matthias Sch@@ rell has some further plans at the location .
With the construction of the Lower Sax@@ ony Bridge , R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ g@@ ard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe .
Thanks to the mo@@ oring basin to the front of the terminal , sun@@ ken to a depth of 18.@@ 5 metres , it has for some time now been possible to un@@ load Cap@@ e@@ size bulk carriers here .
&quot; In terms of handling , this year we hope to break the 3 million ton@@ ne mark , &quot; said Sch@@ rell .
Al@@ ongside the local E@@ on power plant , the imported co@@ als also go to power plants inland .
When the G@@ D@@ F-@@ Su@@ ez plant is added to the network , around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic .
The three ship un@@ lo@@ aders on the bridge and the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million .
Bavaria &apos;s bas@@ ketball players optimistic in spite of first defeat .
Even their first defeat in the Euro@@ le@@ ague could not cur@@ tail the huge optim@@ ism of the FC Bayern München Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; No@@ -@@ one can stop us belie@@ ving that we can win , even against the best team in Europe over the last two years , &quot; assessed Bayern coach S@@ ve@@ ti@@ sla@@ v Pe@@ sic following the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) defeat to title defen@@ ders Olymp@@ i@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ä@@ us on Thursday evening .
We have delivered a message : Bas@@ ketball also exists in Munich !
In their first three appe@@ ar@@ ances in the European top flight , the Munich team put in a good performance for long periods , but in the crucial phases were not sufficiently foc@@ us@@ sed .
Initi@@ ally the guests managed to turn a 15-@@ point deficit into a lead , with 13 minutes to go , before Pir@@ ä@@ us was able to turn the game around once again .
&quot; We fought back incredibly well against the two-@@ time Euro@@ le@@ ague champ@@ ions , but then once again made care@@ less mistakes .
We are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
Mal@@ col@@ m Del@@ an@@ ey and Ni@@ had D@@ je@@ do@@ vic were the most successful stri@@ kers for the Munich team , who had celebrated clear wins against the Italian Series champ@@ ions Monte@@ pa@@ sch@@ i Siena , and the Polish ti@@ t@@ le-@@ holders , Ziel@@ ona G@@ ó@@ ra , in their first two games .
Ben Green@@ man : The T@@ enth An@@ ni@@ versary of the New York Com@@ edy Festival : The New Yor@@ ker
One could argue that New York City is the birth@@ place of stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the v@@ au@@ de@@ vil@@ lian Frank F@@ ay , who served as the master of cerem@@ on@@ ies at the Palace Theatre , on Broad@@ way , started telling jo@@ kes directly to the crowd , in a convers@@ ational manner .
F@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Com@@ edy Festival .
Cre@@ ated and over@@ seen by Carol@@ ine Hir@@ sch , the founder of the stan@@ du@@ p institution Carol@@ ines , the festival celeb@@ rates its tent@@ h anniversary this year , with more than six@@ ty shows at small clubs and large theat@@ res .
&quot; Most of these head@@ lin@@ ers appeared at Carol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; Hir@@ sch said .
We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
This year &apos;s event includes appe@@ ar@@ ances by W@@ anda Sy@@ kes , Kath@@ y Gri@@ ff@@ in , and Bill Mah@@ er , as well as &quot; Stand Up for Her@@ oes , &quot; an annual musi@@ c-@@ and-@@ com@@ edy benefit for military veter@@ ans , at Ma@@ dis@@ on Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bru@@ ce Sp@@ ring@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ wart , Ro@@ ger Wat@@ ers , and Bill Co@@ s@@ by .
As the festival has expanded , so has the world of com@@ edy .
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Com@@ edy Central , F@@ X , and Spi@@ ke .
N@@ ick Kro@@ ll rose to promin@@ ence on a deep@@ -@@ cable sit@@ com ( F@@ X@@ X &apos;s gle@@ efully ra@@ un@@ chy fantas@@ y-@@ foot@@ b@@ all-@@ them@@ ed &quot; The League &quot; ) and now has his own Com@@ edy Central sk@@ etch show .
J@@ enny S@@ late has been a cast member on both &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; and &quot; Parks and Rec@@ re@@ ation , &quot; though she is best known for her vi@@ ral video series &quot; Mar@@ cel the S@@ hell with Sho@@ es On . &quot;
Both Kro@@ ll and S@@ late , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with distinctive voices ( the sur@@ really p@@ essimis@@ tic Anth@@ ony Jes@@ el@@ nik , the w@@ ry , ra@@ cially foc@@ us@@ sed W. Kam@@ au B@@ ell ) , are products of the decentrali@@ zed world of American com@@ edy .
One of the festival &apos;s biggest draws will be an interview : David Steinberg talking to Lar@@ ry David .
Steinberg started as a stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edi@@ an but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an un@@ official com@@ edy hist@@ orian .
From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot; S@@ it D@@ own Com@@ edy with David Steinberg . &quot;
The meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Manhattan .
&quot; The city is definitely in the com@@ edy DNA of all of Lar@@ ry &apos;s work , &quot; Steinberg said .
He was telling me that , when he &apos;s here , sometimes he &apos;ll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself , H@@ ey , if I lose all my money , maybe I &apos;ll live here .
Iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran has expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process , one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany .
&quot; After many years , we have now reached an agreement with the International Nuclear Energy Auth@@ orities to clear up the differences from past years , &quot; wrote Foreign Minister Moh@@ amm@@ ed D@@ sch@@ awa@@ d S@@ ari@@ f on his Facebook page .
It will without doubt be a long path , but the chief nuclear negoti@@ ator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end .
Dra@@ ma in Urugu@@ ay : Bo@@ ys kill play@@ m@@ ate with mach@@ etes
Two children have conf@@ essed to the murder of an 11-@@ year-old in Urugu@@ ay .
The two boys , aged 14 and 12 , had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them .
On Tuesday , armed with mach@@ etes and kni@@ ves , they stab@@ bed the 11-@@ year-old to death and thre@@ w the body into a well , reported the &quot; El Pa@@ í@@ s &quot; newspaper on Thursday .
They then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district .
The body was found the following night in the village of Cer@@ ro Pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del E@@ ste .
A five year-old half-@@ sister of the younger off@@ ender , who they took with them , was to make a statement as an ali@@ bi , stating that she was sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted by the boy .
However , when the girl described the pro@@ gression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself , the two boys conf@@ essed to the pre-@@ medi@@ t@@ ated murder of the 11-@@ year-old .
The older of the pair c@@ ited a ri@@ val@@ ry on the football field as the mo@@ tive .
He was provi@@ sionally taken to a psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c young offen@@ ders institute .
P@@ im@@ p must go to prison
The District Court of Con@@ stance has condemned a 3@@ 3-@@ year-old man from St. Geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison for explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking , p@@ imp@@ ing , issuing threats and grie@@ vous bo@@ di@@ ly harm .
The former German soldi@@ er who , following two tours in Afghanistan , had worked as a door@@ man , made a conf@@ ession within the context of a ple@@ a-@@ bar@@ gaining procedure .
According to the conf@@ ession , on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts , who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks .
He broke any resistance by means of violence and the issuing of threats .
He kept the income from women , some of whom worked for him for years .
He prevented the women from making contact with the outside world by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating their mobile phones and SI@@ M cards .
Together with an accompli@@ ce , who proc@@ ured the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the south-@@ west .
There he had them monitored to some extent , in order to control their income .
Ap@@ pe@@ aring before the court , the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trau@@ ma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion .
Once a psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c condition , and thus on his limited culp@@ ability , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-old made a full conf@@ ession .
The court did not have to question any more of the female victims .
As an official from the Criminal Investi@@ gation Department reported , following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures , at least four further cases of explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking could be identified .
The inter@@ cep@@ ted convers@@ ations were characterised by a high level of ag@@ gression .
In subsequent hear@@ ings , the victims confirmed their or@@ deal .
A further witness , whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bru@@ ises all over her body , is yet to make a statement .
This is a case of a &quot; completely broken personality &quot; , that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal .
Yesterday the accused expressed regret for his behaviour .
&quot; I have removed myself from these circles and hope to lead a completely normal life following my im@@ prison@@ ment , &quot; he stated .
Oil extends drop toward $ 96 a bar@@ rel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China &apos;s power@@ -@@ hung@@ ry manufacturing sector is strengthening .
Ben@@ ch@@ mark U.S. cru@@ de for December delivery was down 14 c@@ ents at $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a bar@@ rel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange .
The contract fell 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it down 5.@@ 8 percent for the month of October .
Amp@@ le supplies of cru@@ de have weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have risen by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tick in activity .
That suggests China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth re@@ bound@@ ed to 7.@@ 8 percent in the third quarter from a two-@@ decade low in the previous quarter .
Br@@ ent cru@@ de , a bench@@ mark for international cru@@ de also used by U.S. refin@@ eries , fell 26 c@@ ents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ rel on the ICE exchange in London .
Court blocks ruling on N@@ Y@@ P@@ D st@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k policy
A federal appe@@ als court on Thursday blocked a judge &apos;s order requiring changes to the New York Police Department &apos;s st@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
The 2nd U.S. Cir@@ cu@@ it Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als said the decisions of Ju@@ dge Shi@@ ra Sch@@ ein@@ d@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of st@@ opping and ques@@ tioning people .
The city appe@@ aled her findings and her re@@ medi@@ al orders , including a decision to assi@@ gn a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
The appe@@ als court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay .
The appe@@ als court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ oul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by com@@ promising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of parti@@ ality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wron@@ g@@ ly targe@@ ting black and His@@ pan@@ ic men with its st@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k program .
She appointed an outside monitor to over@@ see major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test bo@@ d@@ y-@@ worn cameras in some prec@@ inc@@ ts where most stops occur .
In August , New York City agreed to end the practice of stor@@ ing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dis@@ missed after a police stop .
An oral argument on the city &apos;s appeal is scheduled for some@@ time after March 14 , 2014 .
The st@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k tac@@ tic has been critici@@ zed by a number of civil rights advocates .
St@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Blo@@ om@@ berg to an all-@@ time high in 2011 of 68@@ 4,@@ 3@@ 30 , mostly of black and His@@ pan@@ ic men .
A law@@ suit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
Sup@@ por@@ ters of changes to the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D &apos;s st@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will m@@ old a more tru@@ sted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
O@@ pp@@ on@@ ents say the changes would lower police mor@@ ale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shr@@ in@@ king by thousands of officers during the last decade .
The judge noted she wasn &apos;t putting an end to the st@@ op-@@ and-@@ fris@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was reform@@ ing the way the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its stops .
On the happiness of dre@@ aming cam@@ els
Happ@@ iness is an oasis that only dre@@ aming cam@@ els manage to reach
It was with this piece of Bed@@ ou@@ in wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang Hen@@ ne described the history and fasc@@ ination behind the &quot; Hel@@ ping Hand@@ s &quot; society .
Saturday evening saw the celebration of the tent@@ h birthday of the organisation , which can already look back on impressive results .
Found@@ ing Chairman Hen@@ ne reported in depth on the work of the organisation .
In 2004 , he visited the C@@ hei@@ j@@ k-@@ Z@@ aj@@ ed Hospital in N@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ott in Mau@@ rit@@ ania for the first time .
As a result , an important collaboration was developed and the g@@ yn@@ a@@ ec@@ ologist , Han@@ ne , has performed countless operations on several jour@@ neys to the location .
During the speech , images from the trips were shown on a large screen , in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned .
The organisation &apos;s desert vehicle was also shown .
It is a former federal border protection vehicle .
Ra@@ iner Pre@@ wo , the former Lord Mayor of Nag@@ old , made the suggestion of equi@@ pping this vehicle with a photo@@ volta@@ ic system and , according to Hen@@ ne , he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation .
In 2008 , the Schle@@ e@@ h car@@ p@@ entry company from Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bron@@ n built the hospital station in So@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a poor district on the edge of the Capital , in the record time of less than one week - free of charge .
Hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in N@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ott
This is particularly interesting at a time when Nag@@ old is set to do away with its mat@@ ernity clin@@ ic .
You learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa , said Hen@@ ne , for example that you should slow down to avoid bur@@ n-@@ out .
Due to the political un@@ rest in the country , it has not been possible to make as many jour@@ neys as planned , but for this reason , many local doctors have come to Germany , to sit in on lec@@ tures on a variety of topics .
In addition , containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa , for example in March of this year when medical devices , medicines , ban@@ da@@ ging material , hospital beds and spectac@@ les were sent .
Co-@@ initi@@ ator Hans@@ -@@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Fu@@ ch@@ tel himself provided plenty of local colour , telling of Merce@@ des vehicles in Mau@@ rit@@ ania converted into mobile go@@ at st@@ alls and sharing the experiences of the Stamm@@ heim musicians , who traditionally support the organisation on their trips to Mau@@ rit@@ ania .
He identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of audi@@ ting as a young member of parliament .
When it became clear to him how much money is wa@@ sted , he decided to help the Afri@@ cans with controlling of their budget by the people .
Fu@@ ch@@ tel also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kin@@ dness .
The fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten .
Africa is not at all that far from Gran Canaria .

The newspaper t@@ asked private investig@@ ator Gl@@ enn Mul@@ c@@ aire with h@@ acking Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s voic@@ emails and &quot; do@@ or-@@ step@@ ped &quot; her , but C@@ oul@@ son also called and left her voic@@ emails , the court heard .
&quot; The prosec@@ ution suggests that Mr C@@ oul@@ son , who is now the editor of the Not@@ W , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hoping to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr Edi@@ s said .
He said the Not@@ W used three ways to investigate stories : phone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
The editor is personally involved in the third .
Obviously he knows about the second , surveillance , he must do .
What about the first ?
Does he know about phone h@@ acking ?
He says he doesn &apos;t , we say &quot; O@@ h yes , he did &quot; .
Rum@@ ours about an affair involving Clar@@ ke were first picked up by the Not@@ W &apos;s features desk when a source who was sex@@ ually interested in Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by was told : &quot; Don &apos;t bo@@ ther wa@@ sting your time , she &apos;s with Charles . &quot;
A tape of voic@@ emails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was sei@@ zed from Mul@@ c@@ aire &apos;s home in August 2006 .
Investi@@ g@@ ators also found entries on the private investig@@ ator &apos;s computer which had Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her sister as &quot; Pro@@ jects . &quot;
During the period she was being investigated , Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , Mr Edi@@ s said .
Meanwhile , former chief re@@ porter Ne@@ ville Th@@ ur@@ l@@ beck and former re@@ porter James We@@ a@@ ther@@ up over@@ saw surveillance of Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s movements .
Le@@ aving her a voic@@ email on June 18 2005 , C@@ oul@@ son told her : &quot; I &apos;ve got a story that we &apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . &quot;
Mr Edi@@ s said C@@ oul@@ son &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secre@@ tary David Bl@@ unk@@ ett .
The jury heard on Thursday that C@@ oul@@ son confronted Mr Bl@@ unk@@ ett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant Re@@ bek@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was married at the time .
C@@ oul@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny con@@ sp@@ iring with others to h@@ ack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 .
Mul@@ c@@ aire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ beck and We@@ a@@ ther@@ up have admitted phone h@@ acking .
In protest against the planned tax on the rich , the French Foot@@ ball Association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 1972 .
A medi@@ ation meeting comes to an end without resolution .
In the conflict regarding the tax on the weal@@ thy , the government and the professional football association in France have manoeu@@ v@@ red into a cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sa@@ c following a failed medi@@ ation meeting .
President Franç@@ ois Hol@@ lan@@ de welcomed club and association representatives to Paris &apos; É@@ ly@@ s@@ ée Palace on Thursday , where he listened to their complaints .
However , he refused to spare the football association from the planned 75 % income tax to be imposed on those earning in excess of one million € per year , which every company in the country will have to pay for two years , from 2014 .
The opposition also remained ad@@ am@@ ant .
The strike announced for the end of November will now go ahead , informed the head of the Union of Professional Foot@@ ball Clubs ( UC@@ P@@ F ) , Jean-@@ Pierre Lou@@ vel .
The Lig@@ ue 1 and Lig@@ ue 2 match days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will thus be cancelled .
Ge@@ ch@@ ingen : Ab@@ solu@@ te protection not possible
&quot; We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible , &quot; said Mayor J@@ ens H@@ äuß@@ ler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
Around 80 participants came to the Gemein@@ de@@ halle ( community hall ) to have the planned measures explained to them , to express their concerns and submit ideas .
H@@ äuß@@ ler made clear : &quot; The final decisions will be made by the members of the Town Council &quot; .
H@@ äuß@@ ler comm@@ ented that the flood that found Ge@@ ch@@ ingen un@@ prepared on 15 May 2009 , was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future .
A river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of A@@ id@@ lingen , which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; The goal is the protection of as many developed p@@ lots of land as possible , &quot; said H@@ äuß@@ ler .
The basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods , which statisti@@ cally occurs every 100 years , according to the German We@@ ather Service .
Climate change is taken into account in the form of an allow@@ ance of 15 per cent .
In expert circles this is referred to as &quot; H@@ Q 100@@ a@@ Klima &quot; .
The m@@ asses of water that caused considerable damage in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year flood .
&quot; There is no such thing as absolute protection , but we can attempt to make a relative improvement , &quot; said H@@ äuß@@ ler .
In order to achieve H@@ Q 100@@ a@@ Klima protection , around four million € must be invested in Ge@@ ch@@ ingen , whereby the town can count on a State sub@@ sidy of around 70 per cent .
However , H@@ äuß@@ ler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed .
In order to develop such a concept , the town is reli@@ ant on the cooperation of its citizens .
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
In a best case scenario , implementation could begin in 20@@ 16 .
Among other measures , the protection concept , which ( we reported ) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week , plans local measures in the tri@@ but@@ ary to the River Ir@@ m , running from the Stamm@@ heim Valley .
In conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns .
Among others , the question was raised as to why em@@ bank@@ ments and detention reser@@ vo@@ irs are no longer planned to protect the location .
Greg@@ or Küh@@ n , technical plann@@ er at the commissioned engineering company , Hü@@ gel@@ sh@@ eim@@ -based &apos; Wald und Cor@@ be &apos; , who presented the concept , emphasised that it required the inter@@ play of all proposed measures , in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal .
Furthermore , the most economic solution must be found , said Jo@@ ach@@ im Wald of Wald und Cor@@ be .
There was res@@ ent@@ ment among local residents of the old town , who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the over@@ f@@ lowing of the can@@ al network , even during normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms .
The problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken .
However , H@@ äuß@@ ler indicated that the guidelines for can@@ al systems are different to those for flood protection , and these must not be confused .
The town is obliged to design the can@@ al network in such a way that it can with@@ stand ra@@ inf@@ all events every two to three years .
To make the se@@ wer@@ age channels wider would g@@ ob@@ ble up millions .
Person@@ s seriously injured following col@@ li@@ sion
Early on Friday afternoon , two car drivers were seriously injured in a head@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion on Landes@@ straße 44 ( a rural road ) .
The police completely blocked off the road immediately , but initially could not make much comment on the cause of the accident .
However , they did mention that there were various witness statements that first had to be assessed .
What is certain is that the 19@@ -@@ year-old female driver of a V@@ W Golf was driving in the direction of Re@@ v@@ ens@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-old man from G@@ ett@@ or@@ f came towards her in his Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
The two vehicles col@@ li@@ ded , whereby the woman was so severely stuck that it took the fire service almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle w@@ reck@@ age .
Initi@@ ally the actual cause of the accident remained unclear .
Both unfortunate parties were taken to nearby hospitals .
The road remained fully blocked off for around two hours .

And so , as F@@ yo@@ dor M. Do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky - with his massive oeu@@ vre - is considered the reve@@ aler and ap@@ ologist of the Russian soul , Phili@@ p K. D@@ ick is considered an American pro@@ ph@@ et , who is certainly highly este@@ emed within his own native country .

D@@ ick had &apos; God experiences &apos; , and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Re@@ vel@@ ation and a computer manual .
Perhaps he was cra@@ zy , or perhaps drugs had affected his brain .
He realised , early on , that computers are di@@ v@@ ini@@ ties .
He wrote a &apos; The@@ ology of the Computer &apos; and ques@@ tioned what separ@@ ates humans from the machine , the cre@@ ator from the creation .
That is the &quot; Bla@@ de Run@@ ner &quot; problem .

However , D@@ ick &apos;s story is not yet finished .

Is@@ su@@ ing statements regarding the Merkel sp@@ ying scandal from Russia
The former US intelligence expert , Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the US es@@ pi@@ on@@ age scandal involving Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , from his Russian asylum .
Represent@@ atives of the German Federal Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30-@@ year-old in person in Russia , reported the Inter@@ fax Agency .
Green Party parliament representative , Hans@@ -@@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e , was yesterday the first German politi@@ cian to meet with Snow@@ den in Moscow , to discuss the scandal with him .
N@@ SA re@@ vel@@ ations boost corporate par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance
On a mild day in late August a German police helicop@@ ter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the US consul@@ ate in Frankfurt , the financial capital of Germany .
On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , Germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photogra@@ ph the ro@@ of@@ top of the US out@@ post , which is located less than 5@@ km from the European Central Bank and Bundes@@ bank .
German media say the B@@ f@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening anten@@ n@@ as and the action promp@@ ted an exchange between the US and the German foreign mini@@ stry in Berlin .
James Cla@@ pper , US Director of National Intel@@ ligence , insi@@ sted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to ste@@ al the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
But ever since Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den , the contrac@@ tor turned whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , began rele@@ asing his treas@@ ure tro@@ ve of US surveillance secre@@ ts , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
Re@@ ports that the US National Security Agency spi@@ ed on Brazilian oil company Pet@@ ro@@ br@@ as and gained access to data held by US clou@@ d providers including Google and Yahoo have rat@@ ch@@ eted corporate par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance to new high@@ s .
The final stra@@ w came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had been bu@@ gged , possibly for about a decade .
If Europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targeted , then surely business leaders are also potential targets .
Snow@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies .
I think it &apos;s concei@@ vable that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; says Oliver Grün , president of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to a survey published in July by E@@ Y , the consultancy .
In all the documentation le@@ aked by Mr Snow@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secre@@ ts to its own companies .
Poli@@ ti@@ cians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US .
Business leaders are scep@@ tical about this .
Some@@ one in the German parliament says we should build a German Google .
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; That &apos;s not the way , &quot; Has@@ so Plat@@ tner , chairman of German business software company SAP , says .
If one wanted a strong European IT industry , then one sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago .
Everything is subsi@@ dis@@ ed in Germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Still , the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ y agencies exposed by the Snow@@ den re@@ vel@@ ations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China .
A big shift is occurring in clou@@ d comp@@ uting where European exec@@ u@@ tives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to a survey carried out by the C@@ loud Security Alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non-@@ US members cancelled plans to use a US-@@ based clou@@ d provider after re@@ vel@@ ations about the US P@@ ris@@ m data mining programme .
J@@ im Sn@@ abe , co-@@ chief executive at SAP , says : &quot; We see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physi@@ cally in that jurisdiction . &quot;
Many German exec@@ u@@ tives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most pri@@ zed secre@@ ts and these data must therefore be guar@@ ded at all costs .
That economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
It has always taken place .
&quot; This has been a topic for many years and has@@ n &apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck , chief executive of chemical maker BAS@@ F .
The Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an attack@@ er .
For large companies , the message has long since been dru@@ mm@@ ed home that pi@@ cking up a free USB stick at a trade fair , or leaving a laptop ung@@ u@@ ar@@ ded in a hotel room are un@@ wise , to say the least .
Ul@@ rich Hack@@ enberg , board member at car@@ maker Au@@ di , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
Germany &apos;s B@@ f@@ V adv@@ ises exec@@ u@@ tives to consider using simple pre@@ paid mobil@@ es when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are com@@ promised .
The pre@@ paid mobil@@ es are then thrown away afterwards .
However , there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
In Germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular nich@@ e .
&quot; Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secre@@ ts effectively against un@@ authorised access , &quot; the B@@ f@@ V war@@ ns in a report .
The US war@@ ns its own companies about economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
The US National Intel@@ ligence Es@@ timate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offen@@ ders who engage in h@@ acking for economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
A board member at a German blu@@ e-@@ chip company conc@@ urred that when it comes to economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst . &quot;
Bern@@ ard S@@ quar@@ c@@ ini , former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ CR@@ I , was quoted in an interview this month as saying : &quot; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co-@@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist fight , sp@@ y on their allies . &quot;
He@@ ch@@ ingen : Trade fair provides the answers to wedding questions
&quot; Mar@@ ri@@ age is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake , &quot; said the philos@@ op@@ her S@@ ör@@ en K@@ ier@@ k@@ eg@@ a@@ ard .
Ti@@ ps , at least as to how the wedding celebration can be a success , have now been given at a special trade fair in the Dom@@ äne in He@@ ch@@ ingen .
Import@@ ant suppliers of all we@@ dd@@ ing-@@ related products and services were represented .
A trend : The re@@ tro look is back once again .
This begins with the wedding clothing .
White is a must , best mut@@ ed or in cream .
At the front , dres@@ ses with numerous ru@@ ff@@ les and em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y are in , often with a v@@ eil , while to the rear they run down the back and often end in a train .
However , opinions differ , as Ste@@ fan@@ ie Ko@@ ch from the Mode@@ haus Klei@@ der@@ mü@@ ller emphasised .
For men , suits with a wa@@ ist@@ coat and nec@@ ker@@ chief are most popular , although some people do choose cream or brown combinations .
S@@ elec@@ ting the venue is important , it was explained .
Pla@@ in ad@@ joining rooms are not ideal , the ambience should be special .
In this regard , the Dom@@ äne drew attention to their own facilities in the carri@@ age house .
U@@ we Link has an offer for anyone who wants to set off in a carri@@ age .
&quot; However , carri@@ ages are also popular for hen parties , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
People were also on the lo@@ ok@@ out for romantic ideas for inv@@ it@@ ations , flower arrangements and wedding photographs .
The &quot; Af@@ ter-@@ Wed@@ ding Photo &quot; is becoming increasingly fashionable - that is , series of pictures taken a few days after the celebration , at special locations , prefer@@ ably in front of water@@ falls or the like , but in full wedding clothing , explained Elisa@@ beth Kei@@ del .
Many other details for a successful wedding were presented in the Dom@@ äne on Sunday .
F@@ lower arrangements , rings , wedding tables , c@@ akes and also a ma@@ gi@@ cian , such as Mark@@ o Ri@@ p@@ per@@ ger , who can enter@@ tain guests with style .
The correct cosme@@ tics and nail care mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t be forgotten .
Everything you need for an unforgettable celebration .

Par@@ ents of Georgia teen who died in &apos; fre@@ ak accident &apos; believe son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teen@@ ager , whose body was found inside a ro@@ l@@ le@@ d-@@ up w@@ rest@@ ling m@@ at in his high school gym , believe their son was murdered , the family &apos;s att@@ or@@ ney said Thursday .
K@@ end@@ ri@@ ck John@@ son , of Val@@ do@@ sta , G@@ a . , was found Jan@@ . 11 stuck in an u@@ pri@@ ght m@@ at pro@@ pped behind the ble@@ ach@@ ers inside his high school gym .
Lo@@ wn@@ des County sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s investig@@ ators concluded John@@ son died in a fre@@ ak accident , but the 17@@ -@@ year-old &apos;s family disputes that .
&quot; They absolutely think their son was murdered , &quot; Benjamin C@@ rum@@ p , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Kenn@@ eth and J@@ acqu@@ el@@ yn John@@ son , told Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s.com .
They never believed he died the way the sh@@ eri@@ ff concluded .
&quot; They believe that it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physi@@ cs as well as common sense , &quot; C@@ rum@@ p said .
They think this is a cover@@ -up to protect the person or people responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; They sent their son to school with a boo@@ k-@@ bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
U.S. Att@@ or@@ ney Michael Mo@@ ore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into John@@ son &apos;s death , no@@ ting that several key questions remain un@@ answered .
What was the cause of death ?
Was his death the result of a crime ?
Mo@@ ore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
I will follow the facts wherever they lead .
My objective is to discovery the truth .
&quot; I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists &quot; for a formal investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore told re@@ por@@ ters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy indicated John@@ son died as a result of &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . &quot;
A second au@@ top@@ sy , however , listed a different cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&quot; There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Mo@@ ore added that if he un@@ covers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of John@@ son he will ask the F@@ B@@ I to conduct it .
A representative from the Lo@@ wn@@ des County Sher@@ i@@ ff &apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when cont@@ acted Thursday .
A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investig@@ ators reviewed .
The teen@@ ager &apos;s parents said they hope the video foot@@ age will contain clu@@ es to how he died .
CD@@ C issues children &apos;s all@@ ergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday , the C@@ enters for Dis@@ ease Control and Pre@@ vention released a set of guidelines to manage children &apos;s food all@@ ergies at school .
This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out , as the number of school@@ -@@ age children suffering from food all@@ ergies clim@@ bs .
One in 20 children in the United States now have food all@@ ergies .
The CD@@ C found the prev@@ al@@ ence of food all@@ ergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to make fac@@ ul@@ ty and staff aware of children &apos;s food all@@ ergies , and how to handle them should an all@@ ergi@@ c reaction occur .
It also recommends schools have ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine sto@@ cked -- the E@@ pi@@ P@@ en brand au@@ to-@@ injec@@ tor being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fat@@ al an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ xis .
State legislat@@ ures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine more easily .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communic@@ ated by children who are having an all@@ ergi@@ c reaction .
Ki@@ ds may say , &quot; It feels like something is po@@ king my tongue , &quot; &quot; My tongue feels like there is hair on it , &quot; or &quot; My tongue is t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
Par@@ ents of Inter@@ sex Ki@@ ds Can P@@ ick &apos; Gender Un@@ determin@@ ed@@ &apos;
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for bab@@ ies born with ambiguous gen@@ itali@@ a .
No longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female .
The new law doesn &apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender &quot; un@@ determined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certificates .
The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make ha@@ sty decisions on sex@@ -@@ assign@@ ment surgery for new@@ bor@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex .
One inter@@ sex person , according to the BBC , said years later , &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , bru@@ ised and scar@@ red .
An estimated one in 2@@ ,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
They are inter@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of dis@@ orders of sexual development , an umbrel@@ la term for those with at@@ yp@@ ical chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , gon@@ ads ( o@@ varies or te@@ stes ) , or un@@ usually developed gen@@ itali@@ a .
Wal@@ lis Simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sex .
Gender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assi@@ gn it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery , if at all .
New York City psy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist Dr. Jack Dre@@ scher , who speciali@@ zes in issues of gender identification , said the new German law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
Inter@@ sex children pose ethical di@@ lemma .
&quot; Some people have life-@@ en@@ danger@@ ing conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , &quot; he said .
You can make a gender assign@@ ment without surgery , and then see how identity develops .
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate .
N@@ obo@@ dy can answer the questions about why this happens .
It &apos;s like the myst@@ ery of why people are ga@@ y .
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
These features can mani@@ fest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as mus@@ cle mass , hair distribution , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure ; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and gen@@ itali@@ a ; or in chro@@ mo@@ som@@ al structures and hormon@@ es .
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the realm of employment , as well as levels of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and bi@@ as crimes .
Gender non@@ con@@ forming boys now have special camp .
Already , Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
In June , a 5@@ 2-@@ year-old Australian , Nor@@ ri@@ e Ma@@ y-@@ Wel@@ by , became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; gen@@ der@@ less &quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; gender status for life .
German pas@@ sports will have a third design@@ ation other than M or F -- X , for inter@@ sex , according to the Inter@@ ior Ministry .
In neighbor@@ ing France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .
In 2011 , doz@@ ens of French law@@ makers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be withdrawn from school text@@ books .
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; as the world is being dra@@ gged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more pillars of civili@@ zation . &quot;
One Mar@@ y@@ land mother of a new@@ born also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see bab@@ ies assigned gender at birth .
&quot; Par@@ enting is stres@@ s@@ ful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child , &quot; she told the par@@ enting website .
Children need stability and certainty .
Histor@@ ically , children born with both male and female gen@@ itali@@ a were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , named for the hand@@ some Greek go@@ d who had dual sexu@@ ality .
And as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a s@@ late that could be er@@ ased and then re@@ drawn .
But now , many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assign@@ ment when they grow up .
&quot; Back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c emergency , &apos; &quot; said Dre@@ scher .
When these kids were born , you didn &apos;t call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist , you called a sur@@ ge@@ on .
The prev@@ ailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous gen@@ itali@@ a was put forward by Dr. John Money at Joh@@ ns Hop@@ k@@ ins University , who held that gender was m@@ alle@@ able .
He co@@ ined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s genes and hormon@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
But in one 1966 case , known as &quot; John / Jo@@ an , &quot; his the@@ ories became controversial .
He advised the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been sever@@ ed in a bot@@ ched circum@@ ci@@ sion to have the child fully ca@@ str@@ ated , removing his tes@@ tic@@ les , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; Money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; said Dre@@ scher .
When the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
But at 38 , he committed suicide .
Dre@@ scher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practic@@ ing that model . &quot;
But in the 1990s , with the adv@@ ent of the Internet , survi@@ vors of these gender sur@@ ger@@ ies have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
Such was the case with J@@ im Bru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-old writer from Mon@@ tana , who was born with X@@ Y male chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es but ambiguous gen@@ it@@ als .
Doc@@ tors couldn &apos;t be sure if he had a large cli@@ tor@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
So shortly after his birth in 1976 , Bru@@ ce &apos;s external organ and te@@ stes were sur@@ gi@@ cally removed and he was raised as a girl .
He was given female hormon@@ es at age 12 .
&quot; I knew that I wasn &apos;t a girl , &quot; he told AB@@ C@@ New@@ s.com .
I was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he was set for a v@@ ag@@ in@@ op@@ la@@ sty .
But de@@ pressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
What he found out was horri@@ fying .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me .
Bru@@ ce was born with a DS@@ D that prevented his body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als .
After learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one shots and having his bre@@ asts removed .
Sur@@ gery rendered him in@@ fer@@ tile .
Today , he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project , trying to normali@@ ze perc@@ ep@@ tions of those who are inter@@ sex .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar-@@ Mat@@ tis , executive director for Califor@@ ni@@ a-@@ based legal group Ad@@ voc@@ ates for Inform@@ ed Cho@@ ice , wor@@ ries that the German law &quot; invites lab@@ eling and sti@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; un@@ determined , &apos; &quot; she said .
We are afraid it will encourage intervention .
We think a better process is as@@ signing male or female sex , then waiting .
But we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is spec@@ ulate .
Tam@@ ar-@@ Mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; Ad@@ ul@@ ts should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , &quot; she said .
German law is about as@@ signing it at birth .
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
When they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr. Ar@@ l@@ ene Bar@@ atz , a Pit@@ ts@@ burgh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a dis@@ order of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the German law will &quot; em@@ power &quot; both parents and children .
Bar@@ atz &apos;s daughter K@@ atie was born with male chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a DS@@ D called complete and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
Because her and@@ ro@@ gen recep@@ tors are f@@ aul@@ ty , K@@ atie developed female characteristics .
She has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no uter@@ us or o@@ varies .
Now at 29 , K@@ atie is married and at the University of P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , a resident in child psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry .
Though she is in@@ fer@@ tile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gest@@ ational sur@@ ro@@ g@@ acy .
&quot; The law gives parents some space not to have to rus@@ h into making decisions themselves , &quot; said Bar@@ atz .
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female . &apos; 
This way , you are OK -- raise the child , love the child .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
We don &apos;t have to rus@@ h into surgery that is irre@@ ver@@ sible .
&quot; It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxi@@ ety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
It em@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .
Un@@ known attack@@ ers inj@@ ure girl with shots fi@@ red from car
Un@@ known attack@@ ers have injured a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ year-old girl in Sax@@ on@@ y-@@ An@@ halt when fir@@ ing shots from a car .
The as@@ sail@@ ants fi@@ red on a group of children on Thursday evening in Gen@@ thin , pre@@ sum@@ ably with an air gun .
This was announced by the police in Burg .
The girl suffered minor injury to her left cal@@ f .
Res@@ cu@@ e workers took the girl to the hospital .
The shots came from a small car , which dro@@ ve past a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
Wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
The as@@ sail@@ ants also fi@@ red shots at a bus stop .
A pan@@ e of glass was sh@@ at@@ tered .
They then dro@@ ve away .
The Criminal Investi@@ gation Department is investig@@ ating the matter , it was stated on Friday .
Thus far , the K@@ emp@@ ten Police Department can look back on a calm Hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
The authorities were only called out twice to deal with children thro@@ wing eggs against houses .
Because the home owners realised this immediately , the egg rem@@ n@@ ants could be cleaned off at once , meaning that no material damage occurred .
Furthermore , in the town centre area , while a few fire@@ works were set off , no material damage was caused here either .
The residents of the Bisch@@ of-@@ Freund@@ or@@ fer@@ -@@ Weg reported that a car was wra@@ pped in toilet paper and its wheel tri@@ ms st@@ olen .
However , the man found all his wheel tri@@ ms nearby prior to the police arriving , on account of which no further police involvement was required .
Living with a fut@@ ure-@@ oriented perspective
If truth be told , Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies , lives a dre@@ am@@ y life .
Her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart , with plenty of green@@ ery , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
She is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport .
&quot; Hop@@ efully you aren &apos;t afraid of spi@@ ders ? &quot; asks Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies , pointing out a large spi@@ der on the door frame .
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now .
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart .
However , the reason for the desire to move is not ar@@ ach@@ no@@ pho@@ bia , but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house , and inside their home in their old age , she explained .
Furthermore : Since under@@ going a men@@ is@@ cus operation , the lady , in her mid-@@ fif@@ ties , has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability .
Only recently , she released a book on the subject of &quot; Living happ@@ ily in old age - Which type of property is the best for me ? &quot; .
&quot; Our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age , &quot; she begins to re@@ count .
When she moved to the ma@@ ison@@ ette with her husband 20 years ago , it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings .
Now , in her mid-@@ fif@@ ties , Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies has different thoughts about it .
However , she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
The majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible .
Only other people get old , she says , sm@@ ir@@ king .
Only when the psychological stra@@ in becomes severe do people give it consideration .
&quot; But at this stage it can be too late , &quot; said R@@ ies .
In her book , the interior decor@@ ator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age .
&quot; However , which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision , &quot; she explains .
There is no solution to over@@ coming old age .
Even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or B@@ ritt@@ any , you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .
And : &apos; Without a sound knowledge of the local language , you can even become lon@@ ely when living the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; added the author , providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad .
Her models include classic care models , alternative living arrangements and the of@@ ten-@@ mentioned pension@@ ers &apos; living community .
In old age everyone has their qu@@ ir@@ ks and ti@@ cks .
&apos;@@ However , this type of residential community would not be for me , &apos; she comm@@ ented with a w@@ ink .
Defin@@ itely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&apos;@@ In old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to , &apos; said R@@ ies .
However , the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pension@@ ers &apos; residential community can work .
However , it must operate differently to the classic student di@@ gs .
And sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet , &apos; she believes .
With this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capital .
The experience of Ther@@ esa Rü@@ tten , head of the citizen &apos;s Life in Old Age service in the State Capital , is also that &apos; the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .
Her agency agency adv@@ ises people on the topic of &apos; growing old &apos; .
Therefore the experience of the Stiftung War@@ ent@@ est consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept in@@ conveni@@ ences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment .
Nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barri@@ er-@@ free .
R@@ ies recommends that all those working on the age-@@ appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in-depth information and don &apos;t simply use the first tra@@ des@@ man that comes along .
Nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly .
Even in the case of rental apartments some land@@ l@@ ords can have this work carried out , even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat , clarified the interior designer .
However , it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age-@@ appropriate and therefore barri@@ er-@@ free , even if it is as beautiful as ever .
Wal@@ trau@@ d R@@ ies had to go through this experience herself .
You could of course install a sta@@ ir lift inside the apartment , but the co@@ bb@@ led path up to the door of the apartment , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hin@@ d@@ ran@@ ce .
She will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .
She is more afraid of the move than of the spi@@ der on her front door .
The USA still want to prosec@@ ute Snow@@ den
The USA have not changed their position regarding the former US Secre@@ t Service employee Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den .
He is still accused of passing on secret information without authorisation .
He must therefore face criminal proceedings in the USA , said the spo@@ kes@@ person for the US Foreign Office , J@@ enni@@ fer P@@ sa@@ ki , in Washington .
Even the most recent statements from Snow@@ den will not change this fact .
Following a recent meeting with Snow@@ den in Moscow , German Green Party politi@@ cian Hans@@ -@@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e appe@@ aled to the USA not to continue to threaten him with prosec@@ ution .
P@@ sa@@ ki emphasised that Strö@@ bel@@ e &apos;s comments were the views of a parliament@@ arian , and not those of a German government member .
Secre@@ t Service whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den is , in principle , willing to hold a discussion with the German authorities .
However , he first wishes for his situation to be clarified .
This was made clear by the former N@@ SA employee , currently sought by the USA , in an open letter that Green Party politi@@ cian Hans@@ -@@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e made public on Friday following a meeting with Snow@@ den , and passed on to the Federal Government , the Federal Parliament and the Federal Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor General .
The letter was pur@@ ported to have been wor@@ ded as follows :
To whom it may concern ,
I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance .
I am Ed@@ ward Joseph Snow@@ den , formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency , and Def@@ ense Intel@@ ligence Agency .
In the course of my service to these organizations , I believe I witnessed system@@ ic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act .
As a result of reporting these concerns , I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home .
I am currently living in ex@@ ile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .
I am hear@@ tened by the response to my act of political expression , in both the United States and beyond .
Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the re@@ vel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service .
These sp@@ ying re@@ vel@@ ations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly conce@@ aled abuses of the public trust .
The benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitig@@ ated .
Though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ stra@@ bly positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ec@@ tion , and seeks to crimin@@ alize political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence .
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that with the support of the international community , the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behaviour .
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authentic@@ ity of documents , as appropriate and in accordance with the law .
I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved , and thank you for your efforts in up@@ holding the international laws that protect us all .
Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den , as witnessed by Hans@@ -@@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e
A kinder@@ garten has found a private buyer
&quot; The building is in good hands , &quot; said Winter@@ lingen &apos;s Mayor Michael Ma@@ ier .
The local authorities have sold the former Kinder@@ garten on Garten@@ straße to a private buyer .
The Town Council con@@ s@@ ented to the sale in its most recent meeting , during the part of the meeting that was not open to the public .
The building changed hands for an &quot; appropriate &quot; price .
&quot; The local authorities are satisfied , &quot; emphasised Ma@@ ier .
EUR 100@@ ,000 have been added to the local budget .
It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former Kinder@@ garten .
The Mayor considers it the right decision that Winter@@ lingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and thus will no longer have to pay for the up@@ keep of the building , such as heating it , ten@@ ding to the garden and cle@@ aring the p@@ av@@ ement .
&quot; This expense has now been off@@ loaded , &quot; Ma@@ ier was glad to say .

Report : Obama campaign considered dumping Bi@@ den for H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advis@@ ers secre@@ tly considered replacing Vice President Jo@@ e Bi@@ den with H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .
The re@@ vel@@ ation is the most notable bom@@ b@@ shell from Mark Hal@@ per@@ in and John Hei@@ le@@ mann &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tom@@ e , &quot; Double D@@ own : Game Change 2012 . &quot;
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President &apos;s top ai@@ des conducted &quot; extensive gro@@ up-@@ sessions and poll@@ ing in late 2011 &quot; to gau@@ ge whether the dumping Bi@@ den could help bol@@ ster Obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re-@@ election hopes .
According to the Times &apos; national political correspon@@ dent Jon@@ athan Martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Dal@@ ey , to measure what effect sw@@ app@@ ing former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the p@@ olls .
The potential switch was a closely guar@@ ded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the O@@ val Office .
Only half a do@@ zen of the President &apos;s closest advis@@ ers -- including Dal@@ ey , former Obama campaign chief J@@ im Mess@@ ina , and former White House senior advis@@ ers David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David Pl@@ ou@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consideration .
&quot; Double D@@ own &quot; claims Dal@@ ey sp@@ ear@@ headed the effort to replace Bi@@ den , despite their &quot; close personal rap@@ port , &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket w@@ ouldn &apos;t &quot; materi@@ ally improve Obama &apos;s od@@ ds . &quot;
In an interview with Martin , Dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Bi@@ den with Clinton .
&quot; I was vocal about looking into a whole b@@ unch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; Dal@@ ey told the paper .
You have to remember , at that point the President was in aw@@ ful shape , so we were like , &quot; Holy Christ , what do we do ? &quot;
While Dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due di@@ ligence , &quot; Martin told CN@@ N &apos;s Ander@@ son Co@@ oper that the re-@@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay divi@@ den@@ ds at the p@@ olls .
&quot; Camp@@ a@@ ign@@ s don &apos;t spend the kind of money on poll@@ ing and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , &quot; Martin said on AC@@ 360 .
It &apos;s unclear , however , whether Obama knew his team was exploring the s@@ wap .
Martin told CN@@ N that he asked Dal@@ ey whether his th@@ en-@@ bo@@ ss knew about the potential sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le .
While Dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; Double D@@ own &quot; does not definiti@@ vely answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached Obama &apos;s desk .
Co@@ oper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Bi@@ den from the ticket .
&quot; Po@@ s@@ sibly , &quot; Martin rep@@ lied .
What happens with my e-mail when in transit ?
E-mail is short for electronic mail .
Are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspon@@ dence , similar to that of the traditional postal service , implemented into the design of this Internet-@@ based service ?
When designing the early Internet services , the focus lay on making communication possible .
Thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the inter@@ cep@@ tion-@@ proof exchange of mail .
For this reason , a traditional email is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
When user &quot; Anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; B@@ enn@@ i &quot; , are the pair &apos;s computers then directly connected ?
Anna &apos;s email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server .
If she has a G@@ mail account , for example , this would be Google .
This mail server sends the content to the provider that B@@ enn@@ i uses .
En route , the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet .
B@@ enn@@ i can then call up the content from his provider .
Are traditional e-@@ mails read by third parties on their journey through the net ?
The majority of e-@@ mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient .
Ch@@ ecks are generally carried out by the sender &apos;s provider as to whether the mail contains mal@@ ware as an attach@@ ment .
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems .
In addition , the providers check whether it is nu@@ is@@ ance or un@@ wanted spam mail , which are deleted immediately or at least sor@@ ted into a spam folder .
Do the robots have other tasks ?
In the case of systems such as G@@ mail , the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displa@@ ying contex@@ t-@@ based advertising .
If Anna and B@@ enn@@ i communicate about their upcoming holiday tra@@ vels via G@@ mail , Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers .
Do unknown individuals also read the e-@@ mails ?
The prob@@ ability of un@@ authorised persons reading a mail is extremely low .
However , theore@@ tically , it is possible .
Within companies , administr@@ ators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent .
Law enforcement authorities and Secre@@ t Services also have legal authorisation to inter@@ c@@ ept or take note of e-@@ mails .
This may include potential illegal sp@@ ying activities .
Is it possible to protect e-@@ mails against being read ?
With an encryption using the Open@@ P@@ GP standard , an e-mail can be effectively protected against being read .
With great technical effort , it is also possible to conce@@ al the met@@ ad@@ ata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communic@@ ating with whom .
How important are Yahoo and Google within the e-mail market in Germany ?
According to a study conducted by Con@@ vi@@ os Consulting in August 2013 , among the main mail services in private use , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role .
While the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently , Google &apos;s G@@ mail managed to grow considerably .
M@@ other bu@@ ried in sh@@ allow forest grave and pension st@@ olen
When his elderly mother died , a man from Wol@@ fs@@ burg dev@@ ised a plan .
He bu@@ ried the dec@@ e@@ ased in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance .
According to police investigations , a 6@@ 7-@@ year-old Wol@@ fs@@ burg resident bu@@ ried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance .
He first covered up the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-old and then po@@ ck@@ eted the money for more than a year and a half .
The 6@@ 7-@@ year-old must now face charges of fraud , said a spo@@ kes@@ person on Friday .
According to the statement , the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near Hel@@ m@@ st@@ edt .
The man was already under suspi@@ cion back in May : At that time the fact that medic@@ ations for his care@@ -@@ reli@@ ant mother were no longer required drew suspi@@ cion .
The pension@@ er told investig@@ ators that his mother had trav@@ elled to Spain .
The officials found this strange and so continued to investigate .
It was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had c@@ ared for her in her final days .
The 6@@ 7-@@ year-old finally acknowledged the death of his mother .
According to police , an au@@ top@@ sy showed no evidence of any capital off@@ ence .
Fan@@ cy a g@@ low@@ -in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cream ?
A British entrepren@@ eur has created the world &apos;s first g@@ low@@ -in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cream - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has har@@ ness@@ ed the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the marine animal to develop the l@@ umin@@ es@@ cent snack .
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically recre@@ ate the g@@ lowing protein .
The ice cream re@@ acts with the e@@ ater &apos;s tongue - raising the p@@ H level in the protein and making it g@@ low .
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it re@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
Char@@ lie , founder of the &quot; L@@ ick Me I &apos;m Deli@@ cious &quot; ice cream company , said : &quot; It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff . &quot;
The protein we are using in the ice cream re@@ acts with your tongue at neutral p@@ H .
So as your mouth war@@ ms up the protein it will raise the p@@ H level and the ice cream will g@@ low .
We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Hal@@ lo@@ ween because it gives that wonderful g@@ low effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish l@@ umin@@ esc@@ ence is four times more expensive than gold .
So each sco@@ op costs me around £ 140 .
It tastes pretty good though .
Char@@ lie &apos;s experimental company , based in Bristol , is fam@@ ed for its unusual flav@@ ours including beer , cheese , beef and gold lea@@ f .
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
He said : &quot; I really want to develop an in@@ visible ice cream . &quot;
It is inher@@ ently impossible because of the refra@@ ction caused by the ice cryst@@ als which make up the ice cream , but I reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it .
The ice cream har@@ nesses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , synthe@@ sized by Chinese scientists
After six match days , T@@ SV Mor@@ sum are yet to score a single point in the Hand@@ ball Association League .
And of all possible times , In@@ go Eh@@ ler &apos;s team has a der@@ by match against T@@ SV Da@@ ver@@ den tomorrow , which celebrated their first victory last week .
The season begins af@@ res@@ h for us with this match .
&quot; I hope that we finally have our heads clear , &quot; comm@@ ented Eh@@ lers , remaining cau@@ ti@@ ously optimistic .
For this match he finally has his complete squ@@ ad available , with the exception of H@@ end@@ ri@@ ck Blo@@ h@@ me who is out with long-term injury .
Like us , Da@@ ver@@ den place emphasis on high temp@@ o play .
For this reason , we must keep our errors to a minimum .
However , the top priority is to improve our cover play , which has recently left much to be desired .
Da@@ ver@@ den &apos;s coach Thomas Pan@@ itz comes across as much more relaxed following his team &apos;s first victory of the season against Nord@@ horn .
The match was of course a indication of what we are capable of .
However , it by no means makes us favou@@ rites , as anything can happen in the der@@ by .
Nonetheless , Pan@@ itz is now looking to come up with the goods in Mor@@ sum and thus start a winning stre@@ ak .
Jan@@ -@@ Mal@@ te J@@ od@@ at will not be playing .
Thus , A-@@ Youth player J@@ oo@@ st Wind@@ ß@@ uß , who plays an active part for A-@@ Youth League team HC Bremen , will be celeb@@ rating his season dé@@ but .
Anyone who is not fi@@ red up for a game like this should stay at home .
Hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : By the Num@@ bers
When I was little , Hal@@ lo@@ ween was magical .
My sister and I were allowed to eat cand@@ y , stay up late and play dres@@ s-@@ up for the neighborhood .
Nowadays , I &apos;ve become more of a sc@@ ro@@ o@@ ge .
I haven &apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out cand@@ y in my apartment and probably won &apos;t this year .
But stat@@ s show that I &apos;m a black sheep when it comes to Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
The majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celeb@@ rating Hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on cand@@ y , cost@@ umes and decor@@ ations , according to the National Ret@@ ail Federation .
One thing I do look forward to every Hal@@ lo@@ ween are the trends .
Co@@ st@@ umes are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , sexy in@@ anim@@ ate objects are all the rage .
Women don &apos;t have to be sexy professionals anymore ; they can also be sexy foods like p@@ izza , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ om@@ bies , thanks to The Walking De@@ ad and I &apos;ll bet the D@@ af@@ t Pun@@ k space men will make it into our Inst@@ agra@@ m feeds this year .
According to Google , the highest sear@@ ched cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ bies , Bat@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I gu@@ ess there &apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional .
We dres@@ sed our dogs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
In fact , Americans will spend $ 3@@ 30 million on pet cost@@ umes this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
That &apos;s a lot of ir@@ onic hot@@ dog dogs .
When it comes to cand@@ y , we don &apos;t scre@@ w around .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion on it this year , according to The Niel@@ sen Company .
That &apos;s around 600 million po@@ unds worth of Her@@ sh@@ ey bars , l@@ ol@@ li@@ po@@ ps , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , Twi@@ zz@@ lers and Clar@@ k Bars .
That &apos;s great news for the 41 million tri@@ ck-@@ or-@@ treat@@ ers set to take over our neighbor@@ hoods , according to the U.S. Commerce Department .
In fact , we will buy and , who are we ki@@ d@@ ding , consu@@ me 90 million po@@ unds of chocolate during Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
The one thing we don &apos;t want to consu@@ me , cand@@ y cor@@ n ; and yet nearly 35 million po@@ unds of it are sold around Hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the National Con@@ fec@@ tion@@ ers Association .
That &apos;s about 9 billion individual kern@@ els of cor@@ n .
It &apos;s a myst@@ ery I have yet to solve .

In fact , there are 1,@@ 200 officially sanc@@ tioned ha@@ un@@ ted houses in the United States generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes those a@@ wes@@ ome photos of you mid-@@ pe@@ eing your pan@@ ts that your friend puts on Facebook and you can &apos;t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot; nice face . &quot;

House fire in Hel@@ mb@@ rechts : Res@@ cu@@ e services retri@@ eve char@@ red body
The fire service were called out to Hel@@ mb@@ rechts late on Thursday evening .
A three-@@ bedroom house in the district of Hof cat@@ ches fire during the night .
Res@@ cu@@ e workers retri@@ eve a char@@ red body from the house .
During a fire in Hel@@ mb@@ rechts , rescue services found a char@@ red body in a three-@@ bedroom house .
Whether this person was living in the house is as yet unclear , said a police spo@@ kes@@ person in Bay@@ re@@ u@@ th .
L@@ ate on Thursday evening , fire broke out on the ground floor of the house .
When the fire service arrived , the fl@@ ames were already bur@@ sting out of a window .
Res@@ cu@@ e workers entered the premises and found the body in a bedroom .
This and another bedroom were completely bur@@ nt out .
The entire ground floor suffered damage .
There were no other residents at home during the fire , continued the police spo@@ kes@@ person .
For the time being , the house is no longer hab@@ itable .
The precise cause of the fire was initially unclear .
Germany &apos;s largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister &apos;s position .
This comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers : The Prote@@ stant Lu@@ ther@@ an Regional Church of Han@@ over calcul@@ ates that , as things stand , the current number of around 1,@@ 800 past@@ ors will be hal@@ ved by 20@@ 30 .
For the young people of today , the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Past@@ or Ma@@ this Bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in a conversation with the Prote@@ stant Press Service .
It is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working routine .
With Bur@@ fi@@ en , the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time , endeav@@ ouring to insp@@ ire young people to study the@@ ology .
At present , fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study the@@ ology after their Ab@@ it@@ ur exam@@ inations ( equivalent to A levels ) .
Bur@@ fi@@ en puts this down to the process of sec@@ ular@@ isation : &quot; God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
The job is characterised by great freedom and variety .
I am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me .
As past@@ oral workers , ministers can be close to people .
They earn as much as teachers and can make a good living .
Of course wages are higher within the private sector , but on the other hand , the@@ ologi@@ ans have a secure emplo@@ yer .
This would suit the young people of today , as it is not just about your career , but about having a meaningful job as well .
According to information from the Regional Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Sax@@ ony , around 60 past@@ ors reti@@ re every year .
At the same time , around 40 the@@ ology gradu@@ ates begin as vi@@ cars .
In future it may be difficult to fill positions in spar@@ sely populated out@@ lying areas such as Har@@ z , Em@@ s@@ land or W@@ end@@ land .
Among other initiatives , Bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organise study days for young people , inviting famous faces who have studied the@@ ology .
The@@ ology courses offer broad training .
You can even become Federal President with a the@@ ology degree .
Land R@@ over rally series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-@@ point har@@ ness bel@@ ts , as well as an inter@@ com system .
Op@@ tions include upgraded bra@@ kes , a service package providing access to Bow@@ ler Works mechan@@ ics , log@@ istic support , and vehicle storage between events .
Dre@@ w Bow@@ ler , the managing director of Bow@@ ler Motor@@ sport , said : &quot; R@@ ally customers coming to Bow@@ ler have changed . &quot;
They &apos;re not all experienced rac@@ ers , but people looking for exc@@ itement and adventure , and an achie@@ vable path towards world-@@ class events .
We &apos;re delighted to be offering this path in partnership with Land R@@ over and the M@@ SA , and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally discipl@@ ines in the UK and overseas , and prepare entran@@ ts for the rig@@ ours and realities of R@@ ally Ra@@ id .
We &apos;ve really enjoyed developing the Def@@ ender Challenge car - it &apos;ll be a really fun champ@@ ionship .
Additionally , the Def@@ ender Challenge will provide a training and test day in February , as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East .
Fire cre@@ ws called to rescue lost pu@@ ppy after she got stuck 50@@ ft above the ground on prec@@ arious le@@ dge in a quar@@ ry
Co@@ cker span@@ iel Ru@@ by had run off after she was in a minor road crash
She was spot@@ ted three days later by a dog wal@@ ker tra@@ pped in the quar@@ ry
Fire@@ figh@@ ters ab@@ sei@@ l down cli@@ ff face to plu@@ ck the dog from certain death
A pu@@ ppy had a lucky escape after fire cre@@ ws were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50@@ ft up on a prec@@ arious cli@@ ff le@@ dge .
N@@ ine mon@@ th-@@ old co@@ cker span@@ iel Ru@@ by had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before being rescu@@ ed from a quar@@ ry on Wednesday .
Her owners Scott Al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend B@@ eck@@ y Hall , 20 , were at Fla@@ pp@@ it Quar@@ ry in Den@@ hol@@ me , West Yor@@ k@@ shire , to be re@@ united with Ru@@ by and have than@@ ked West Yor@@ k@@ shire Fire and Res@@ cu@@ e Service .
They had sear@@ ched fran@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appe@@ als on social networking sites after she had ran into the quar@@ ry following the minor accident .
At around 2.@@ 15@@ pm on Wednesday , an eag@@ le-@@ e@@ yed dog wal@@ ker spot@@ ted Ru@@ by on the le@@ dge in the quar@@ ry , str@@ anded 50@@ ft up .
A Technical Res@@ cu@@ e Team from Cle@@ ck@@ he@@ aton Fire Station rus@@ hed to the scene and ab@@ sei@@ led down to rescue Ru@@ by and used a pet tube to transport her up the cli@@ ff .
Speci@@ alist Technical Res@@ cu@@ e Officer An@@ dy C@@ lay@@ ton said : &apos; She was in a prec@@ arious situation .
She was right in the middle of the cli@@ ff face - 50@@ ft from the top and bottom .
She did not move a mus@@ cle during the rescue - she was frozen solid .
But she is fine now .
She was eating bis@@ cu@@ its afterwards .
This was a very unusual call@@ -@@ out .
The fact that the dog was spot@@ ted is un@@ belie@@ vable .
Speci@@ alist Technical Res@@ cu@@ e Officer Peter L@@ au said : &quot; Ru@@ by had a very lucky escape . &quot;
The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was taken to the v@@ ets for a check-@@ up and was found to be fine other than exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion .
Mis@@ s Hall , from H@@ ali@@ fax , West Yor@@ k@@ shire , said : &quot; Wat@@ ching the rescue was terri@@ fying . &quot;
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
It was amazing to get her back in our arms .
The v@@ et said that if she became too exhau@@ sted and collap@@ sed she would probably have fallen .
The fire@@ figh@@ ters were amazing .
It was really dar@@ ing what they did .
We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ eigh@@ ley , added : &quot; We were sc@@ ared that she might fall but she stayed there . &quot;
The fire@@ figh@@ ters were brilliant .
I just can &apos;t believe where she was .
M@@ ick Jag@@ ger says he never hit on K@@ aty Per@@ ry when she was 18 .

George Ker@@ ev@@ an : Europe break@@ -up gives Sc@@ ots choice
Another day , another independence sc@@ are story .
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europ@@ e-@@ wide free-@@ travel zone as a condition of EU membership .
C@@ ue stories about passport controls at Ber@@ wick and a bar@@ bed wire border along H@@ ad@@ ri@@ an &apos;s Wall .
Tru@@ e , the Stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of fre@@ er movement with the rest of Europe , though - pre@@ dict@@ ably - that did not figure in the head@@ lines .
Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time ben@@ ding their formal rules if it suits them .
Since Scotland isn &apos;t in the Schengen area now , continued non-@@ compliance would be a cheap conc@@ ession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Sc@@ ots .
So , a non-@@ story , then .
And one that is so long in the to@@ oth it has become fossi@@ li@@ sed : I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a wh@@ is@@ ker@@ y old tale .
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding , anyway ?
Why trade London &apos;s yo@@ ke for that of Brussels , especially now ?
Here is the real European news : the great , post-@@ war plan to unite Europe has finally st@@ alled .
With the euro crisis , Project Europe is officially dead .
A@@ cross the EU , parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU , or to scra@@ pping the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from no@@ where to gra@@ b nearly five million votes in September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively kno@@ cking the Free Democrats ( equivalent to our own Li@@ b D@@ ems ) out of the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ shed .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , coupled with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et imposed on national economies through adher@@ ence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece .
Rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German expor@@ ters - something German politicians want to keep .
Without the possibility of domestic currency de@@ valu@@ ation , southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis@@ -@@ à-@@ vis Germany .
The only rec@@ ourse is to s@@ lash wages and public spending - sp@@ urred on by Berlin .
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity mal@@ a@@ ise .
As a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsi@@ dis@@ ing French and German energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .
That is a crip@@ pling cost disadvantage , as we &apos;ve already seen at Gran@@ gem@@ outh .
All the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;t stop the European pet@@ ro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ mer@@ ed by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , revol@@ t is bre@@ wing , especially in France , once the EU &apos;s main che@@ er@@ leader .
After the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal b@@ illing in the world with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , leaving the bat@@ tered French economy stru@@ ggling .
Resul@@ t : Marine Le P@@ en &apos;s right-@@ wing , anti-@@ EU National Front has just won a crucial by-@@ election , kno@@ cking the ruling Socialists into third place .
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
What is Le P@@ en doing with her new@@ found popularity among the French white , working class ?
She wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections to create an anti-@@ EU , anti-@@ common currency blo@@ c across the European Parliament .
If , as is very possible , anti-@@ EU parties do well in these elections , such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the European Parliament for the first time .
Here &apos;s my point : some@@ time soon growing anti-@@ EU and anti-@@ common currency feeling in Europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro .
The EU won &apos;t disappear , but it will rever@@ t to something more like the loose &quot; Europe of the ( So@@ verei@@ gn ) Nations &quot; favoured by General de Gaulle .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revi@@ ve their own currencies .
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project , hoping to cosy up to the US .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
Where does this leave Scotland ?
We can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) Little England .
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off .
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
Co-@@ operation with other lik@@ e-@@ minded countries will be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe of the Nations .
Otherwise we should consider em@@ ul@@ ating Norway and re@@ taining our economic independence .
The S@@ N@@ P government in Scotland is - remark@@ ab@@ ly-@@ - the most successful anti-@@ austerity political movement in Europe , having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Labour &apos;s chan@@ cell@@ or Ali@@ sta@@ ir Dar@@ ling and the subsequent Tor@@ y-@@ Li@@ b Dem coalition .
It would be ridicul@@ ous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
Early pu@@ ber@@ ty : Gro@@ wing older sooner
Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts , research shows .
Phy@@ sical changes don &apos;t mean pu@@ ber@@ ty is im@@ min@@ ent
There &apos;s no evidence that hormon@@ es or other chemicals are to blame
Exper@@ ts think the obe@@ sity epide@@ mic might be one trigger of early pu@@ ber@@ ty
The trend toward early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pron@@ ounced with boys
For@@ mer CN@@ N correspon@@ dent P@@ at Eth@@ eri@@ dge is a journalist speciali@@ zing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
Should a mother be al@@ armed if her daughter begins to s@@ pro@@ ut breast bu@@ ds and p@@ ub@@ ic hair at 7 or 8 ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cs this week in Or@@ land@@ o , Florida , pedi@@ atri@@ c en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Dr. Paul Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new nor@@ m .
&quot; I spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid pro@@ gression into full pu@@ ber@@ ty , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz .
Ob@@ vious signs of development , such as bud@@ ding bre@@ asts , p@@ ub@@ ic and under@@ arm hair and body od@@ or are appearing sooner in girls .
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , down from 12.@@ 75 in 1970 .
&quot; Once bre@@ asts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz , also author of &quot; Early Pu@@ ber@@ ty in Gir@@ ls : The Essen@@ tial Guide to Cop@@ ing with This Common Problem . &quot;
Time is the most accurate test of how pu@@ ber@@ ty is going to progress .
There is debate about what constitutes the actual on@@ set of pu@@ ber@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; pre@@ co@@ cious &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sp@@ urt before age 8 .
In most cases , the process will slow down or st@@ all -- something a pedi@@ atri@@ cian can monitor closely .
A more rapid pro@@ gression may warrant tests by an en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist to rule out serious problems such as tum@@ ors or c@@ yst@@ s .
There are treatments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequence : pre@@ mature aging of the b@@ ones that ultimately can lead to stun@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
Rec@@ omm@@ end@@ ations for drug or hor@@ m@@ one therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional mat@@ urity .
Psy@@ cho@@ social aspects are important , too .
Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz is cau@@ tious with medic@@ ation but acknowled@@ ges , &quot; sup@@ pressing pu@@ ber@@ ty may allevi@@ ate behavi@@ oral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from pe@@ ers . &quot;
The other big issue is understandable : Par@@ ents simply don &apos;t want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters having periods .
&quot; They worry about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz .
&quot; It was a shock , &quot; rec@@ alls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
Even though there were signs and we had talked about men@@ stru@@ ation , she was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
She came home from school sc@@ ared and up@@ set to be the first among her friends .
There are lots of well-@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed the@@ ories about the causes of pre@@ co@@ cious pu@@ ber@@ ty .
Yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormon@@ es in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
Bo@@ ys - like girls - are hit@@ ting pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier .
Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz con@@ tends the pre@@ mise that holds the most weight is the epide@@ mic of obe@@ sity .
He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6@@ - to 9-@@ year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of pu@@ ber@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
In this country , Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts .
There are varying explanations .
Glob@@ ally , patterns of early pu@@ ber@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
Another con@@ und@@ rum : Although boys are getting fac@@ ial and p@@ ub@@ ic hair at younger ages , the trend toward full-@@ blo@@ wn early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pron@@ ounced as it is with girls .
Other doctors attending the A@@ AP conference reinforced the comple@@ xi@@ ties of the topic .
The appearance of ac@@ ne and p@@ ub@@ ic hair is common even in in@@ fan@@ ts and to@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; We need to be careful about how we identify the true on@@ set of pu@@ ber@@ ty , &quot; said Dr. Law@@ rence Silver@@ man , a pedi@@ atri@@ c en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist at Gor@@ ye@@ b Children &apos;s Hospital in Mor@@ rist@@ own , New Jer@@ sey .
Par@@ ents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pedi@@ atri@@ cian about how to talk with their child .
&quot; It may mean having a so@@ on@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected conversation , &quot; Kap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz advised .
If you remain calm , your child usually will respond well .
Gir@@ ls who b@@ los@@ som early need re@@ assurance that , even when it happens ahead of schedule , the process is a normal part of life .
Jet makers feu@@ d over seat width with big orders at stake
A row has fla@@ red up between leading plane makers over the width of tou@@ ri@@ st-@@ class seats on long-@@ distance flights , setting the tone for a bitter confron@@ tation at this month &apos;s Dubai Air@@ show .
The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-@@ hau@@ l flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest j@@ ets offered by Airbus SA@@ S and Bo@@ eing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cab@@ ins , but its U.S. arch@@ -@@ ri@@ val Bo@@ eing says it should be for airlines to decide .
The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-@@ larger versions of their tw@@ in-@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the November 17@@ -@@ 21 event .
How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini-@@ j@@ umb@@ o &quot; jet designs .
Bo@@ eing says its rev@@ amp@@ ed &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X &quot; will hold 4@@ 06 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row .
Airbus says the competing version of its A3@@ 50 will carry 350 people in 18-@@ in@@ ch-@@ wide economy seat laid out 9 ab@@ re@@ ast .
Plan@@ e gi@@ ants often trade blo@@ ws on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
Now , Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X is expected to domin@@ ate with more than 100 orders .
It recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing finan@@ ci@@ ers a slide illustr@@ ating three people squ@@ ash@@ ed together at a restaurant , ti@@ tled &quot; Would You Acc@@ ept This ? &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ distance flying in seats narro@@ wer than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said Airbus sales chief John Le@@ ah@@ y .
As di@@ ets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not radi@@ cally changed .
Between the early 1970s , when the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 j@@ umb@@ o defined modern long-@@ hau@@ l travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 40@@ - to 4@@ 9-@@ year-old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U.S. Health Department Data .
The wa@@ ist of the average 2@@ 1@@ st-@@ century American male is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 in@@ ches , according to U.S. health statistics .
Airbus says its ri@@ val is sti@@ cking to a seat concept from the 1950@@ s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly ch@@ risten@@ ed &quot; jet set &quot; was narro@@ wer .
Airbus says it has commissioned research sugge@@ sting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Bo@@ eing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fa@@ res and facilities .
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said Bo@@ eing cab@@ ins expert K@@ ent Cra@@ ver .
They don &apos;t want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them profitable .
They know their business better than anyone else .
For fl@@ yers it is about more el@@ bow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
Beh@@ ind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 7@@ 00-@@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the sc@@ ales of U.S. and European exports .
As Re@@ uters first reported in July , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest j@@ ets .
Both Airbus and Bo@@ eing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest tw@@ in-@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ hau@@ l designs than the market leader in that segment , the 36@@ 5-@@ seat Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 300@@ ER .
Bo@@ eing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on compar@@ ing the 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X with an original 9-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 77 design .
The gain in unit costs is bl@@ un@@ ted compared with 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast now in use .
&quot; The reason Bo@@ eing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said Kev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus .
On the other hand , an@@ alyst@@ s say full 10-@@ se@@ at-@@ per@@ -@@ row cab@@ ins for existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s suggest many passengers are voting for the den@@ ser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fa@@ res .
&quot; Ei@@ gh@@ teen in@@ ches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 7@@ 77 , &quot; said cabin inter@@ iors expert Mary Kir@@ by , founder and editor of the Run@@ way Gir@@ l Network .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
Glo@@ be@@ -@@ tro@@ t@@ ting jet s@@ ellers even carry tape measures to check on competing lay@@ outs .
While bo@@ asting comfort , all buil@@ ders also offer j@@ ets with high-@@ density lay@@ outs for low-@@ cost airlines and regional travel .
Airbus offers a 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast A3@@ 50 but says it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus was stres@@ sing the need for more cabin custom@@ ization by offering wider a@@ is@@ le seats on some of its j@@ ets .
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern j@@ ets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could di@@ stra@@ ct from a wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X sales .
New anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigare@@ tte .
A single dose of the vacc@@ ine was able to protect mi@@ ce against nic@@ ot@@ ine addi@@ ction for life .
Further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor Ron@@ ald Cr@@ yst@@ al of Wei@@ ll Corn@@ ell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .
&quot; We are very hop@@ e@@ ful that this kind of vacc@@ ine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop , exhau@@ sting all the methods on the market today , but find their nic@@ ot@@ ine addi@@ ction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Pro@@ f Corn@@ ell said .
The new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus selec@@ tively infec@@ ts li@@ ver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies hun@@ t down any nic@@ ot@@ ine molec@@ ules in the bloo@@ d@@ stream , neutrali@@ sing them before they reached the brain , preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a nic@@ ot@@ ine hit .
In tests , vacc@@ inated mi@@ ce who were subsequently given nic@@ ot@@ ine continued with their normal activity .
But mi@@ ce who had not been given the vacc@@ ine &quot; ch@@ illed out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
The experiments are described in the journ@@ al Science Transl@@ ational Medi@@ cine .
Pre@@ vious tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
The j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels t@@ opp@@ ed up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical .
But the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is likely to be far lower , because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body factories .
Pro@@ f Cr@@ yst@@ al said that if a future human vacc@@ ine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a cigare@@ tte , preventing nic@@ ot@@ ine addi@@ ction .
But more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to qu@@ it .
&quot; They will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that can help them k@@ ick the hab@@ it , &quot; he said .
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by O@@ bei@@ d
For@@ mer N@@ S@@ W Labor minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be investigated by the state &apos;s corruption wat@@ ch@@ dog .
For@@ mer N@@ S@@ W minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime le@@ ases policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ bei@@ d , who had hidden interests in three properties on govern@@ ment-@@ controlled land .
The Independent Commission Against Cor@@ ruption ( IC@@ AC ) on Friday wi@@ dened its inquiry into whether Mr O@@ bei@@ d lob@@ bi@@ ed several state ministers to have le@@ ases at Cir@@ cular Qu@@ ay , where the O@@ bei@@ ds owned two restaurants and a caf@@ e , renewed without going to tender after their exp@@ i@@ ration in August 2005 .
It &apos;s now investig@@ ating alleg@@ ations Mr Tri@@ po@@ di knew of Mr O@@ bei@@ d &apos;s secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former dep@@ uty chief of staff , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ p@@ ole , on Thursday .
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the le@@ ases to go to public tender .
The les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms .
In 2009 le@@ ases for the Cir@@ cular Qu@@ ay enterprises , which earned the O@@ bei@@ ds about $ 2.5 million annually , were renewed without going to public tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , was initially in favour of public ten@@ ders .
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr O@@ bei@@ d , who Mr Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was ur@@ ging a shift in government lease policy .
A phone trans@@ cript tabled in IC@@ AC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ bei@@ d , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Steve Dun@@ n , a senior bureau@@ cra@@ t who had come into the ports mini@@ stry after working under Mr O@@ bei@@ d in the fisheries department .
&quot; Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone convers@@ ations the development of the commercial lease policy , &quot; Assi@@ stant Commissioner Anth@@ ony W@@ heal@@ y asked Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; No , &quot; Mr Tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
I can &apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn &apos;t that .
Defin@@ itely not between myself and Mr O@@ bei@@ d .
Israeli war@@ planes attack target inside Syria , official says
Israeli war@@ planes struck a target inside the Syri@@ an port city of Lat@@ akia Thursday night , a senior administration official confirms to Fox News .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .
The Associ@@ ated Press reports the target was Russi@@ an-@@ made SA@@ -@@ 125 missi@@ les .
At least twice earlier this year Israel launched air@@ strikes on ship@@ ments of missi@@ les inside Syria .
Foreign workers on 4@@ 57 visas could under@@ go &quot; genu@@ inen@@ ess &quot; test
A &quot; genu@@ inen@@ ess &quot; test for foreign workers on 4@@ 57 visas is being considered by the government as it con@@ templates expanding a cra@@ ck@@ down .
The test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 45@@ 7@@ s being used to fill un@@ skilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia .
A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor M@@ P Max@@ ine Mc@@ Ke@@ w sl@@ amm@@ ed the government &apos;s rhetoric about foreign workers , saying it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; Lou@@ d declarations about &apos; foreigners getting to the back of the qu@@ eu@@ e &apos; and &apos; Aus@@ sie jobs first &apos; are a very un@@ pleasant thro@@ w@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market , &quot; she told the Australia India Institute today .
Histor@@ ically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echo@@ es of that historic arti@@ fact , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t be surprised .
The discussion paper out@@ lines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Imm@@ igration Minister Chris Bo@@ wen .
Imm@@ igration Minister Br@@ end@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smu@@ ggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remain@@ der under consideration .
If the &quot; genu@@ inen@@ ess &quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrut@@ in@@ ised about &quot; whether the nom@@ ination is genuine in circumstances where the nom@@ ine@@ e is a relation or personal associ@@ ate of an owner or relevant person of the spon@@ sor@@ ing business . &quot;
Busin@@ esses could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to spon@@ sor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
Meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old Sri Lan@@ kan asylum see@@ ker died of a suspec@@ ted heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week .
The man &apos;s di@@ str@@ au@@ ght n@@ ine-@@ year-old son trav@@ elled to Australia with him and has been com@@ for@@ ted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cou@@ sin who was also on the vessel .
Australian authorities rus@@ hed the man to Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .
A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .
The work by H@@ S@@ 2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 20@@ 26 .
Transport minister Baroness Kra@@ mer said the project would &quot; bring the UK together . &quot;
Scottish transport minister Kei@@ th Brown said he was &quot; exc@@ ited &quot; to work with the UK government on the plan .
Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Manchester and Le@@ eds .
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7@@ bn to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ bn .
The UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland , has instruc@@ ted H@@ S@@ 2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .
This is to include the possibility of event@@ ual journey times from Glas@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less .
Baroness Kra@@ mer said : &quot; Our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &quot;
We are driving forward H@@ S@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
But it is also about connec@@ tivity , across the UK 18 cities including Glas@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh will be better connected because of H@@ S@@ 2 .
Scottish Secretary Ali@@ sta@@ ir Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael added : &quot; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
For the Scottish government , Kei@@ th Brown called on Mr Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael to &quot; unequi@@ vo@@ cally &quot; back Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &quot; High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland , but also adds Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . &quot;
So we are exc@@ ited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and comple@@ ment@@ ing the Glas@@ go@@ w-@@ Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to re@@ viewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
Air@@ craft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tab@@ lets and smart phones during ta@@ ke-@@ off and landing despite moves in the US to loo@@ sen regulations covering the devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-@@ books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot; air@@ plane &quot; mode .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it anno@@ ying to be unable to access their e-@@ books during ta@@ ke-@@ off@@ s and land@@ ings .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision , which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia .
&quot; C@@ ASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said .
The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Virgin , which has already been talking to C@@ ASA about extending the use its in-@@ flight wi@@ -@@ fi entertainment system , was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regul@@ ator .
&quot; We would welcome a review by C@@ ASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in-@@ flight entertainment ) on our planes , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
Q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
&quot; Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during ta@@ ke-@@ off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .
The FA@@ A ruling applies to American airlines .
However , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FA@@ A &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .
For US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet .
Car@@ ri@@ ers will need to prove their planes can toler@@ ate radio interference from mobile devices as well as rev@@ ise manu@@ als , training materials , car@@ r@@ y-@@ on baggage programs and passenger brie@@ f@@ ings .
&quot; Once an airline veri@@ fies the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use hand@@ held , light@@ weight electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ readers , and sm@@ art@@ ph@@ on@@ es-@@ at all al@@ ti@@ tudes , &quot; the FA@@ A said .
In rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instruc@@ t passengers to turn off their devices during landing .
The group also recommended that heavi@@ er devices should be safely sto@@ wed under seats or in over@@ head b@@ ins during ta@@ ke-@@ off and landing .
Trav@@ elling B@@ V@@ B fans created terrible scenes with fla@@ res in the Vel@@ t@@ ins Arena before the district der@@ by against Schal@@ ke
Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund announced that there would be serious consequences .
Before Friday &apos;s Bundes@@ lig@@ a match against V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the &apos; Ul@@ tras &apos; responded with silence - initially .
It was an unusual , almost gh@@ o@@ stly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the ki@@ ck-@@ off of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a match between the German run@@ ner@@ s-@@ up Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mend and V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , in the Signal I@@ d@@ una Park .
It was mainly the chan@@ ts of away fans that could be heard .
The south stand , on the other hand , where the most lo@@ yal - and the lou@@ dest - of B@@ V@@ B fans stand , was initially un@@ usually quiet : No singing and no battle cri@@ es .
The &apos; Cap@@ o &apos;s &apos; po@@ dium , the individual who usually coordin@@ ates the un@@ ison chan@@ ts , remained empty .
And right at the front , on the stand , a single large flag with the text &quot; Stadium B@@ an Section &quot; ble@@ w in the wind .
Only when go@@ al@@ keep@@ er , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller , was the first B@@ V@@ B player to step onto the field , did che@@ ers briefly erup@@ t , as is usually the case .
When his team m@@ ates followed , there was loud singing and scar@@ ves were wa@@ ving - but by no means everywhere .
In the central blocks of the south stand , blocks 12 and 13 , nothing moved .
Even stadium announ@@ cer , Nor@@ bert Di@@ ck@@ el , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the der@@ by victory , the win against Ar@@ senal , the contract extension of coach J@@ ör@@ gen klo@@ pp - did not raise spiri@@ ts .
Just five minutes before ki@@ ck-@@ off , the Cap@@ o clim@@ bed onto his po@@ dium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point , li@@ fted with a large sh@@ out , as Di@@ ck@@ el asked for a sh@@ out from each section of fans as usual .
As always , the south stand was left until the end , and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the lou@@ dest section of the stadium .
And as soon as the vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous request for &quot; der@@ by winners stand up &quot; came from the south stand upon ki@@ ck-@@ off , everything was back to normal .
The previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days .
Im@@ medi@@ ately before the local district der@@ by against FC Schal@@ ke 04 , some of the travelling B@@ V@@ B fans fi@@ red fla@@ res into the crow@@ ds of spec@@ t@@ ators and onto the pit@@ ch - and in so doing almost hit go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller .
The ki@@ ck-@@ off was delayed on account of the cha@@ o@@ tic scenes ,
As a result , B@@ V@@ B Chairman Hans Jo@@ ach@@ im W@@ atz@@ ke had invited the heads of the Dor@@ t@@ mund Ul@@ tras fan group to his office - and if W@@ atz@@ ke &apos;s words are to be believed , this was a rather un@@ comfortable meeting for the fan representatives .
&quot; There will be massive impact for the entire Ul@@ tra movement , &quot; announced the B@@ V@@ B Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .
As an immediate measure , W@@ atz@@ ke prohibited the Ul@@ tras from organising cho@@ re@@ ography for the home match against V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart .
&quot; I have banned it , &quot; he explained .
We cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics in Sax@@ ony .
In addition , the Ul@@ tras were given the option of several different pun@@ ish@@ ments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept .
Otherwise B@@ V@@ B will impose a san@@ ction by the end of next week , said W@@ atz@@ ke .
&quot; It will be severe , &quot; assured W@@ atz@@ ke .
It will be interesting to see the reactions in the south stand then .
Pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pin@@ ch
At a pa@@ wn@@ shop in Ben@@ de@@ me@@ er shopping centre in Singapore , Jan@@ ani Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a is sw@@ app@@ ing a gold ban@@ gle , ring and pair of ear@@ rings to pay her dau@@ gh@@ ters &quot; school fees .
&quot; My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s stuck there , &quot; Mrs Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a says .
Even though she ear@@ ns S $ 3@@ ,000 ( $ 2,@@ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .
Indeed , such is demand across parts of sou@@ theast Asia - where household debt is rising - that Valu@@ e@@ Max , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third pa@@ wn@@ shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .
Pa@@ wn@@ ing je@@ well@@ ery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,@@ 300 in Ms Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
Typ@@ ically pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.@@ 4 per cent offered at United Over@@ seas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
However , pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of sal@@ ary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pa@@ wn@@ shops as families feel the squ@@ ee@@ ze from rising living costs and bal@@ lo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , lower@@ - and mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ income families are turning to pa@@ wn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
This week Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s , the rating agency , c@@ ited increasing household le@@ verage , mainly from rising mort@@ g@@ ages , as a risk factor for Asian banks &quot; credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
It said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product rati@@ os in Asia .
Malaysia t@@ opp@@ ed the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week narro@@ w@@ ly emerged from technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued export weakness , and a sof@@ tening in consumer demand .
&quot; Bot@@ tom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can , &quot; says Song Sen@@ g W@@ un , econom@@ ist at C@@ IM@@ B , a Malay@@ sian bank .
Histor@@ ically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rus@@ h to pa@@ wn personal bel@@ ong@@ ings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family je@@ well@@ ery .
In Singapore , about 70 per cent of items pa@@ wn@@ ed at the cit@@ y-@@ state &apos;s 200 pa@@ wn out@@ lets are gold .
People are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s pa@@ wn grand@@ ma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month .
In Thailand the largest pa@@ wn@@ shop operator , Eas@@ y@@ Money , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its out@@ lets in recent months .
Such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that Valu@@ e@@ Max , operator of the out@@ let at Ben@@ de@@ me@@ er and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Y@@ e@@ ah Lee Ch@@ ing , Valu@@ e@@ Max &apos;s executive director .
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 6@@ 6@@ m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange .
While some discount len@@ ders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Y@@ e@@ ah says that not only does pa@@ wn@@ ing offer cheaper rates than other len@@ ders , it also does not add directly to debt .
&quot; Customers are mort@@ g@@ aging items that they already own , and mon@@ e@@ ti@@ sing personal assets does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .
There &apos;s an increased social acceptance of pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ king as a means to secure short term , secured financing .
Nor are the types of people who use pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers only the financially stret@@ ched .
We@@ al@@ thy people in Singapore also use Valu@@ e@@ Max out@@ lets , pa@@ wn@@ ing gold bars or Rol@@ ex wat@@ ches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .
We see customers from all walks of life .
&quot; They include weal@@ thy individuals who need to bor@@ row short term for business vent@@ ures or investments , or small businesses with a need to ti@@ de over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for T@@ as@@ sie health
The Federal Government insi@@ sts a $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package for T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can &apos;t waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister T@@ any@@ a P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
The funding , over four years , was decided after government consultations with T@@ as@@ man@@ ian independent M@@ P Andrew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&quot; The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said today .
The $ 3@@ 25 million package includes a $ 31 million elec@@ tive surgery bli@@ tz .
An additional 26@@ 00 operations including or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c and cat@@ ar@@ act surgery will help clear a back@@ log .
There &apos;s also money for wal@@ k-@@ in clin@@ ics in Ho@@ bart and La@@ un@@ c@@ est@@ on , better after@@ -@@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the roll@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; These investments respond to the ideas that fron@@ t-@@ line clin@@ ici@@ ans have told me will be the best ways to tend to T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
The minister insi@@ sted the T@@ as@@ man@@ ian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Comm@@ on@@ wealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
A three-@@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie today said the $ 3@@ 25 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing . &quot;
He nevertheless pra@@ ised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&quot; I &apos;m hop@@ e@@ ful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said .
According to the State Government these additional elec@@ tive procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But federal Opposition health spo@@ kes@@ man Peter Dut@@ ton believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; b@@ and-@@ aid solution . &quot;
&quot; The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ri@@ pped $ 4@@ 30 million out of its health system , &quot; he told AB@@ C TV .
You can &apos;t have a state government ri@@ pping out almost half-@@ a-@@ billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth put in $ 300 million and pre@@ tend it &apos;s a good news day .
Mr Dut@@ ton called on Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability , wat@@ ch@@ dog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and po@@ ison gas m@@ uni@@ tions , the global chemical weapons wat@@ ch@@ dog said Thursday as fi@@ erce clas@@ hes ra@@ ged in the country &apos;s north , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored .
Also Thursday , a Syri@@ an activ@@ ist group said more than 120@@ ,000 people have been killed since the start of the country &apos;s civil war nearly three years ago .
The announcement by the Organization for the Pro@@ hi@@ bition of Chem@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons came one day ahead of the No@@ v .
1 deadline set by The H@@ agu@@ e-@@ based organization for Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &quot; render in@@ oper@@ able &quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into po@@ ison gas and filling m@@ uni@@ tions .
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant mile@@ stone in an ambitious tim@@ eline that aims to destroy all of Dam@@ as@@ cus &apos; chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014 .
Dest@@ ru@@ ction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stock@@ pil@@ es .
The country is believed to have around 1,000 met@@ ric tons of chemicals and weapons including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the ner@@ ve agent s@@ arin .
The announcement came as fighting ra@@ ged Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fir@@ a , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the Bri@@ tain@@ -based Syri@@ an Ob@@ servatory for Human Rights .
The activ@@ ist group , which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria , said Thursday that 120@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people have died .
Of those , it said 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 are civilians , including 6,@@ 365 children .
On the government side , it said 29@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 are members of President B@@ ash@@ ar As@@ sad &apos;s armed forces , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro-@@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 are Leban@@ ese He@@ z@@ bollah milit@@ ants .
Also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 20@@ 2 army def@@ ec@@ tors and some 5,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreigners .
On July 25 , the U.@@ N@@ . estimated 100@@ ,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated that figure since .
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to fle@@ e the country .
As@@ sad &apos;s troops have been batt@@ ling reb@@ els , many of them linked to al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da groups , in Sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks .
The Ob@@ servatory said there were cas@@ u@@ alties on both sides Thursday but had no specific@@ s .
The fighting under@@ sco@@ red the dangers the chemical weapons &apos; inspec@@ tors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic ar@@ senal in the midst of an ongoing civil war .
A statement from the O@@ PC@@ W , which works closely with the United Nations , said its team was &quot; now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria &apos;s declared critical production and mixing / filling equipment . &quot;
It added that , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed their first round of verification work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspec@@ tors said .
On Thursday , O@@ PC@@ W said the two locations were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted . &quot;
It was not immediately clear if the facility in Sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two sites that O@@ PC@@ W inspec@@ tors were not able to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the O@@ PC@@ W &apos;s executive committee .
&quot; I s@@ alu@@ te the for@@ titude and courage you &apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; the wat@@ ch@@ dog &apos;s direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general , Ah@@ met U@@ zu@@ m@@ c@@ u , said in comments released by the O@@ PC@@ W .
Now in its third year , the civil war p@@ its the primarily Sun@@ ni Muslim reb@@ els against As@@ sad &apos;s government and its security forces , which are st@@ ack@@ ed with members of his Ala@@ wi@@ te sec@@ t , an off@@ shoot of Shi@@ ite Islam .
In other developments , the Ob@@ servatory &apos;s chief Ram@@ i Ab@@ dur@@ rah@@ man said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria &apos;s coastal province of Lat@@ akia .
The cause of the b@@ last was not known , he said .

P@@ ate@@ k , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of Sou@@ th-@@ East Asia &apos;s most wanted , was yesterday sent@@ enced to 20 years in j@@ ail for his role in building the explo@@ sive devices used in the bom@@ bing .
He could be released within 15 years if granted par@@ ole .
The 4@@ 5-@@ year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of K@@ uta which left 20@@ 2 people dead , including 88 Austra@@ li@@ ans , and injured scores more .
He was also found guilty of a number of other terror@@ ism@@ -@@ related charges , including a wave of bom@@ b@@ ings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas E@@ ve in 2000 .
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; Demo@@ li@@ tion Man &quot; for his reputation as a master bom@@ b-@@ maker be sent@@ enced to death .
The decision has re@@ ign@@ ited painful memories for Per@@ th mother June Cor@@ teen , who lost her 3@@ 9-@@ year-old twin dau@@ gh@@ ters Jan@@ e and J@@ enny in the destruction un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed by P@@ ate@@ k and his co-@@ con@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
Fi@@ gh@@ ting back te@@ ars , she said P@@ ate@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
I really feel that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other guys .
&quot; He should be put in front of the fir@@ ing squ@@ ad , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen told A@@ AP .
I have to live every day without seeing more grand@@ children , and my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
The S@@ ari Club was lev@@ elled when a massive bomb loaded into a van par@@ ked outside was de@@ ton@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on October 12 , 2002 .
Peter Hu@@ gh@@ es was in Pad@@ dy &apos;s Bar where a suicide bom@@ ber de@@ ton@@ ated a back@@ pack loaded with explo@@ si@@ ves just 20 seconds earlier .
He lap@@ sed into a mon@@ th-@@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bom@@ bing , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support .
Mr Hu@@ gh@@ es said P@@ ate@@ k should have shared the same fate as three other members of the J@@ ema@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ ah terror cell responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ zi , Mu@@ k@@ h@@ las and Ima@@ m Samu@@ dra - who were executed four years ago .
Re@@ ally , this guy should get the death penalty before anybody .
To keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
To get 20 years , after killing 20@@ 2 people and inj@@ uring many hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
P@@ ate@@ k is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to face justice .
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually ap@@ prehen@@ ded in January 2011 in the Pakist@@ ani town of Ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where US forces killed former al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da chief O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden less than four months later .
During the trial , an F@@ B@@ I agent t@@ esti@@ fied that intelligence reports had revealed P@@ ate@@ k was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-@@ establish links between Sou@@ th-@@ East Asian terrorist groups and al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da .
&quot; He didn &apos;t give himself up , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
Until just recently , he really didn &apos;t feel sorry for how much grie@@ f he caused other people .
The verdi@@ ct comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by cerem@@ on@@ ies in Bali and Australia .
&quot; There will be a lot of te@@ ars this year , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
P@@ ate@@ k may yet appeal his sentence .
FA@@ A : Air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on planes ( but not make cell phone calls )
Air@@ line passengers will be able to use their electronic devices g@@ ate-@@ to-@@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell@@ phones - under mu@@ ch-@@ anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers sh@@ ouldn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately .
How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , FA@@ A Administrator Michael Hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news conference .
Airlines will have to show the FA@@ A how their air@@ planes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manu@@ als and rules for sto@@ wing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
The FA@@ A said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
Delta and J@@ et@@ Blue were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already submitted plans .
&quot; Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FA@@ A said in a statement .
Currently , passengers are required to turn off their sm@@ art@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door clo@@ ses .
They &apos;re not supposed to re@@ start them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the cap@@ tain gives the go@@ -@@ ahead .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not re@@ start them until the plane is on the ground .
Under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during ta@@ ke@@ off@@ s , land@@ ings and ta@@ xi@@ ing , the FA@@ A said .
Most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi@@ fi at higher al@@ ti@@ tudes are expected to meet the criteria .
Lau@@ ra Gl@@ ading , president of the Association of Professional F@@ light At@@ ten@@ dants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win@@ -@@ win , &quot; Gl@@ ading said in a statement .
We &apos;re frank@@ ly tired of feeling like &apos; hall monit@@ ors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But connecting to the Internet to surf , exchange emails , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers will be told to switch their sm@@ art@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices to air@@ plane mode .
So , still no Wor@@ ds With Friends , the online S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble-@@ type game that actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his sm@@ art@@ phone in 2011 when he was fam@@ ously bo@@ oted off an American Airlines jet for ref@@ using to turn off the device while the plane was par@@ ked at the gate .
And heavi@@ er devices such as lap@@ tops will continue to have to be sto@@ wed because of concern they might inj@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cabin .
In-@@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited .
Regul@@ atory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission , not the FA@@ A .
FA@@ A may lift ban on some electronic devices during ta@@ ke@@ off and landing
Last month , National Transpor@@ tation Safety Board Mark Rosen@@ ker , a C@@ BS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; C@@ ell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devices , but we do know , according to the F@@ CC , that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they &apos;re in the air , &quot; Rosen@@ ker said .
An industry advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
Press@@ ure has been building on the FA@@ A in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ . Cla@@ ire Mc@@ Cas@@ kill , D-@@ M@@ o . , con@@ tend there is no valid safety reason for the prohi@@ bitions .
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ub@@ i@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
The FA@@ A began restri@@ cting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying F@@ M radi@@ os , the high-tech g@@ ad@@ gets of their day .
New air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reli@@ ant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FA@@ A to be resistant to electronic interference .
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cru@@ ising al@@ ti@@ tudes to passengers for several years .
Plan@@ es modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
The vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , Hu@@ er@@ ta said .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power radio trans@@ missions than previous generations of devices .
E-@@ readers , for example , em@@ it only minimal trans@@ missions when turning a page .
But trans@@ missions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data .
Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been Ama@@ zon@@ .com .
In 2011 , company officials loaded an air@@ liner full of their Kin@@ dle e-@@ readers and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found none .
FA@@ A advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
Dou@@ glas K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line Pas@@ sen@@ gers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .
Other committee members said there are only an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al reports from pi@@ lots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
However , the committee recommended the FA@@ A allow pi@@ lots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument land@@ ings in low visibility .
A travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them comm@@ on-@@ sense accommodations for a traveling public now bri@@ st@@ ling with technology .
&quot; We &apos;re pleased the FA@@ A recogn@@ izes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not in@@ compatible with safety and security , &quot; said Ro@@ ger Do@@ w , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
Bir@@ d air@@ li@@ fted to safety from North Sea ri@@ g released back into wild
A bird air@@ li@@ fted ash@@ ore after being found exhau@@ sted on a North Sea oil ri@@ g has been released back into the wild .
The water rail was put on a helicop@@ ter to Aber@@ de@@ en last month before being nur@@ sed back to health by the Scottish SP@@ CA at its rescue centre in Al@@ lo@@ a .
Centre manager Co@@ lin S@@ ed@@ don said : &quot; This water rail was likely a winter m@@ igrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . &quot;
It seems the bird became exhau@@ sted and managed to find refuge on the oil ri@@ g .
He added : &quot; It was unable to fly off again so we were cont@@ acted for help . &quot;
The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released .
Is Europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain ?
Business for Britain launched in April with a ple@@ dge to bring business together and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job cre@@ ators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU .
To that end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive pol@@ l of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the EU .
You@@ Go@@ v poll@@ ed over 1,000 business leaders , broadly representative of Britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .
The conclusions of the pol@@ l will come as a surprise to many .
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , focusing on countries that are modernis@@ ing and growing while the EU states stag@@ n@@ ate .
They want to see the Government priori@@ tise new trading links with the likes of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reform@@ ing the EU &apos;s ar@@ cane institutions .
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to West@@ min@@ ster .
There was general dis@@ content with the Single Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro@@ -European of companies , agreed .
Finally , and most t@@ ell@@ ingly of all , our pol@@ l of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade , not politics .
This finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the UK .
The st@@ akes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent s@@ wing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt : this pol@@ l shows that British business backs his plan for rene@@ goti@@ ating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that business expects that rene@@ goti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .
A better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the eurozone emb@@ arks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our pol@@ l show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels &quot; regulatory approach .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s Alex@@ ei Mil@@ ler says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s chief said .
&quot; A land@@ mark event has taken place today : Con@@ struction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most large-scale and important project in Europe , &quot; Gaz@@ pro@@ m Chairman Alex@@ ei Mil@@ ler said in a statement Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent .
South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in Ukraine , which hosts most of Russia &apos;s gas for Europe , adds a layer of risk to conventional routes , officials say .
Mil@@ ler said the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means geo@@ political risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot; forever . &quot;
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a dis@@ counted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m said construction should begin in other down@@ stream countries by year &apos;s end .
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trilli@@ on c@@ ub@@ ic feet of natural gas .
Nothing be@@ ats Germany as a property location for national and international investors .
The economic situation is right , and the financing options are fantastic .
This was the message of the 9th &apos; Immobili@@ ent@@ ag &apos; ( Property Day ) organised by the Bör@@ sen Zeitung ( stock exchange newspaper ) .
The German property markets are benef@@ iting from the country &apos;s economic strength and general conditions which , compared with the rest of Europe , are very competitive .
This was pointed out by Christian Ul@@ bri@@ ch , Jones L@@ ang La@@ S@@ alle CEO for Europe , the Near East and Africa , at the 9th &apos; Immobili@@ ent@@ ag &apos; ( Property Day ) organised by the Bör@@ sen Zeitung ( stock exchange newspaper ) .
The extent to which German commercial properties are sought after is evident in the transaction volumes , said Ul@@ bri@@ ch .
In the first three quarters of this year , there was an increase of 31 % compared to the same period the year before .
In Great Britain , growth stands at just 6 % , and in France at 19 % .
&quot; Property investments offer an attractive rate of return , &quot; said Ul@@ bri@@ ch .
The yield gap between properties and federal government bonds is at a histor@@ ically high level .
The FA@@ A is eas@@ ing restrictions on the use of electronic g@@ ad@@ gets on air@@ planes - though chat@@ ting on cell@@ phones will still be prohibited .

Two Y@@ M@@ CA employees charged with sex offences before alleg@@ ations against Jon@@ athan Lord , Royal Commission h@@ ears
Two Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W employees had been charged with child sex offences before alleg@@ ations were raised against Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h child care worker Jon@@ athan Lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard .
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot; never dealt with an incident of child sexual ass@@ ault within its organisation , &quot; the Commission was told .
Chief executive officer Phil@@ li@@ p H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ CA employee was charged child porno@@ graphy offences , and another when a gym instruc@@ tor at the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h Hall was convi@@ cted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991 .
Mr H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness , coun@@ sel assi@@ sting the Commission , he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
He conc@@ eded the Y@@ M@@ CA &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claiming &quot; there have been external audi@@ ts of the Y@@ M@@ CA that have recognised the Y@@ M@@ CA as being at the fore@@ front of child safety . &quot;
E@@ vi@@ dence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ CA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year .
Mr H@@ are , who started with the Y@@ M@@ CA when he was 21 , conc@@ eded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recru@@ iting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy bre@@ aches .
Ear@@ lier this year Lord was convi@@ cted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA .
He was j@@ ailed for a minimum of six years .
But Mr H@@ are rejected the suggestion the Y@@ M@@ CA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord &apos;s bre@@ aches of child safety .
Staff gave evidence they observed bre@@ aches including Lord being alone with children , bab@@ y@@ sitting them priv@@ ately , having them sit on his la@@ p , saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone .
Dan@@ ielle O@@ ck@@ well , who was superv@@ ised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , t@@ esti@@ fied she found the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h children &apos;s services manager J@@ acqu@@ i Bar@@ n@@ at who superv@@ ised Lord &quot; very intim@@ id@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
The CEO said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were un@@ comfortable with reporting up@@ wards to their managers .
Rather , he said , their friend@@ ships with Lord clou@@ ded their jud@@ gements about reporting him .
Mr H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; Jon@@ athan Lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .
Mr H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the alleg@@ ations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ CA general manager of children &apos;s services Li@@ am Whit@@ ley .
He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot; over@@ ze@@ alous &quot; and poor@@ ly executed .
Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W was not a child safe organisation at the time Jon@@ athan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Sm@@ all@@ bone of Gri@@ ff@@ ith University told the commission .
He said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , screening , in@@ duction , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing ad@@ jour@@ ned until December 20 .
Tony Blair said he &apos;d sei@@ ze the chance to return as Britain &apos;s prime minister - but acknowled@@ ges a com@@ eb@@ ack is unlikely .
In an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 5@@ 9-@@ year-old ai@@ red his views on various domestic policies .
Since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , con@@ fin@@ ing most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as en@@ voy to the Quar@@ tet of Middle East pe@@ ac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers .
A@@ sk@@ ed if he would return to the post of prime minister , Mr Blair was quoted by London &apos;s E@@ ven@@ ing Standard as saying : &quot; Yes , sure , but it &apos;s not likely to happen is it , so ... &quot;
As crow@@ ds of hor@@ se-@@ showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Hor@@ se of the Year , they knew the competition would be tough .
But nobody was quite ready for three-@@ year-old F@@ ent@@ on Kir@@ kland .
Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps , the to@@ dd@@ ler and his pet Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony T@@ off@@ ee tro@@ t@@ ted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents tra@@ iling behind .
The in@@ separ@@ able pair - who are the same height - were comm@@ ended for appearance , behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sun@@ ny@@ bank Equ@@ est@@ ri@@ an Centre , in Ru@@ dry near Cardiff .
Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bow@@ ler h@@ ats , he ti@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ un@@ ty angle and par@@ aded two-@@ year-old T@@ off@@ ee around the ring .
F@@ ent@@ on was lau@@ ded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
And T@@ off@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and personality .
F@@ ent@@ on was given T@@ off@@ ee as a third birthday present last March and has practi@@ sed with the Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony every day since .
His mother Donn@@ a , 30 , said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee are a great double act . &quot;
They were up against all com@@ ers but the two of them wal@@ ked off with the gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
It was only the second time he had compet@@ ed with T@@ off@@ ee and we were all ec@@ static when he won .
Comple@@ te stran@@ gers in the arena all thought he was so phenom@@ en@@ al they wanted photos taken with him .
The young@@ ster , from the village of N@@ ant@@ y@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ bb@@ w V@@ ale , South Wales , is following in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ unt Sharon Ho@@ well@@ s , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years .
Mrs Ho@@ well@@ s said : &quot; The whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cla@@ pping . &quot;
He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvell@@ ous job .
F@@ ent@@ on is animal mad - he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has got two chi@@ ck@@ ens which he looks after .
The way he has started he &apos;ll be at the Hor@@ se of the Year show before long - and I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do well .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his p@@ ony . &quot;
They are a great team together .
The judges marked F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
They look for good te@@ am@@ work between the p@@ ony and the hand@@ ler - F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee were the best in the ring .
I &apos;m sure F@@ ent@@ on was helped by his cu@@ te clothes , he really looked the part .
China ple@@ a paper &apos; to be over@@ hau@@ le@@ d@@ &apos;
A Chinese newspaper that made a fron@@ t-@@ page appeal for the release of a re@@ porter accused of de@@ fam@@ ation is to be over@@ hau@@ led , a press regul@@ ator says .
The Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ hou@@ -based New Express made a rare public ple@@ a for the release of journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ zh@@ ou .
But Mr Ch@@ en subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabri@@ c@@ ate stories about a part state-@@ owned company .
Now the New Express is to under@@ go &quot; full recti@@ fication , &quot; the regul@@ ator said .
The &quot; recti@@ fication &quot; order came from the Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Administration of Press and Publi@@ cation , Radio , Film and Tele@@ vision .
A preliminary investigation showed that Y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group &apos;s New Express had published several un@@ true reports about listed company Zo@@ om@@ lion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 .
&quot; New Express &apos;s edi@@ torial management was dis@@ ordered , &quot; the regul@@ ator said in a statement .
It said it had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ zh@@ ou by re@@ vo@@ king his re@@ porter &apos;s license . &quot;
It had also &quot; instruc@@ ted Y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group to undertake a complete recti@@ fication of New Express , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately rev@@ ise New Express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;
Mr Ch@@ en wrote several articles for the New Express alleg@@ ing financial irregularities at a construc@@ tion-@@ equipment company called Zo@@ om@@ lion .
After he was de@@ tained , his newspaper published two fron@@ t-@@ page appe@@ als for his release , saying it backed his journ@@ alism .
But Mr Ch@@ en then appeared on state television ad@@ mitting he had published false stories for money .
&quot; In this case I &apos;ve caused damages to Zo@@ om@@ lion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; he told state broad@@ cast@@ er CC@@ TV .
I did this mainly because I han@@ k@@ ered after money and f@@ ame .
I &apos;ve realised my wron@@ g@@ doing .
Following Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s ap@@ ology , New Express issued a fron@@ t-@@ page ap@@ ology , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .
Several high-@@ profile sus@@ pects have made tel@@ ev@@ ised conf@@ essions recently .
Exper@@ ts say conf@@ essions are still rout@@ inely co@@ er@@ ced , despite a change in the law earlier this year bann@@ ing the authorities from forcing anyone to inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate themselves .
US-@@ Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
One of the most sophisticated drug smu@@ ggling tun@@ nels between the USA and Mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , ven@@ tilation and electric rail systems .
US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they have ever discovered .
The tunnel , which zi@@ g@@ z@@ ags the length of nearly six football pit@@ ches , links ware@@ houses near Ti@@ ju@@ ana , Mexico and San Die@@ go , USA .
The area is filled with non@@ descri@@ pt ware@@ houses , making it easier to conce@@ al trucks being loaded with drugs .
The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through un@@ detected , authorities said .
Auth@@ orities sei@@ zed eigh@@ t-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 3@@ 27 po@@ unds of co@@ ca@@ ine in connection with the tunnel &apos;s discovery , according to court records .
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine with intent to distribute .
They face prison sentences between 10 years and life im@@ prison@@ ment if convi@@ cted .
In No@@ g@@ ales , Ari@@ zona , smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers tap into vast underground dra@@ in@@ age can@@ als .
The tunnel is the eigh@@ th major passage discovered in San Die@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the largest tun@@ nels have been discovered after central Mexico &apos;s mari@@ ju@@ ana harv@@ est in October , which presents drug car@@ tels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
In 2010 , authorities found a roughly 7@@ 00-@@ yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Ti@@ ju@@ ana home to two San Die@@ go ware@@ houses .

&quot; Spre@@ ads are very popular , &quot; explained U@@ te Hen@@ kel@@ mann the owner of the local health food store , which provides a host of special products for ve@@ gans .
Re@@ ub@@ en Proc@@ tor also likes to visit the store on &quot; Dom@@ gasse &quot; .
The New Ze@@ al@@ ander has been v@@ eg@@ an for 13 years , and in Lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m he can find ( almost ) everything that he needs to get by . &quot; In 1997 I adjusted my diet and became a veget@@ arian &quot; .
At the turn of the millenni@@ um I took the next step and became v@@ eg@@ an .
&quot; However , it wasn &apos;t just the diet that convinced me , but also my choice of shoes , &quot; said Proc@@ tor , who pre@@ fers artificial leather over normal leather .
He realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products .
First and foremost , being v@@ eg@@ an is a matter of ethics .
&quot; I don &apos;t want animals to have to die for me , &quot; said Proc@@ tor , expressing the ma@@ x@@ im of ve@@ gans , which applies to all their consumer behaviour .
Rather than missing bur@@ gers , scra@@ mb@@ led eggs or gum@@ mi bears , the v@@ eg@@ an has quickly discovered entirely new products that really insp@@ ire him .
&quot; It is a double bonus , &quot; says Proc@@ tor now , &quot; in actual fact being v@@ eg@@ an is not about doing without , it &apos;s not about as@@ ce@@ ticism , but rather it is an enhan@@ cement &quot; . Regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options , Proc@@ tor puts this down to force of hab@@ it .
And it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well-@@ inten@@ tioned attempt failing .
&quot; The temp@@ tation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up , similar to with smoking , &quot; says Proc@@ tor , providing a comparison .
And he argu@@ es : &quot; Cer@@ tain flav@@ ours are not linked to animal produce &quot; .
Often it is the her@@ bs or the type of preparation that provide the flav@@ our .
&quot; You can , however , create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the v@@ eg@@ an .
For example , when attending a bar@@ bec@@ ue party , Proc@@ tor brings auber@@ g@@ ines , mus@@ h@@ rooms and also a few v@@ eg@@ an s@@ aus@@ ages .
He ensures a balanced , varied diet , whereby everything should also have a good hear@@ ty flav@@ our .
Of course you want to have something with a bit of b@@ ite , that is fair enough .
&quot; It should be tasty , but this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean anim@@ al-@@ based food , &quot; said Proc@@ tor .
He has not suffered any damage to his health or eating dis@@ orders - another wide-@@ spread assumption .
Conver@@ ting has had a positive effect for me .
I do not consu@@ me any foreign ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol and have increased my vit@@ amin in@@ take .
There are top athle@@ tes who also have an exclusively v@@ eg@@ an diet .
&quot; My blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis , &quot; revealed Proc@@ tor .
Many critics of ve@@ gan@@ ism war@@ n in particular of the lack of vit@@ amin B@@ 12 .
&quot; Because animals are fed on fo@@ d@@ der instead of gra@@ zing , it is du@@ bi@@ ous whether the vit@@ amin B@@ 12 content in meat sold in free@@ zers is actually high , &quot; comm@@ ented Proc@@ tor .
For ve@@ gans there is also the option of taking the co-@@ enz@@ y@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; My B@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explained .
Proc@@ tor does not have to travel far to buy food .
There are basic foodstuffs available everywhere , and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
I can find everything I need locally .
I only purchase special items now and again .
&quot; Many people over@@ look the fact that even though read@@ y-@@ made v@@ eg@@ an products are expensive , it is well-known that this is also the case for &quot; normal &quot; read@@ y-@@ made products .
In any case , the preparation of v@@ eg@@ an dishes is much cheaper and less time consum@@ ing than commonly assumed .
&quot; In home cooking , there is much to be discovered - with a few minor t@@ weak@@ s you can achieve good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; said Proc@@ tor .
Mar@@ gar@@ ine in place of but@@ ter , a little more b@@ aking powder and b@@ ic@@ ar@@ bon@@ ate of so@@ da in place of egg - Proc@@ tor has even managed to aston@@ ish his in-@@ laws with his v@@ eg@@ an cheese c@@ akes .
The v@@ eg@@ an adds new sp@@ ice to family parties .
When you co@@ ok together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value .
&quot; The situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves , &quot; said Proc@@ tor .
Of course he has already met with scep@@ ticism .
Do you not like my food any more ?
&quot; Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? &quot; - as a v@@ eg@@ an you have to be tac@@ tful in such matters .
&quot; I do not dis@@ approve of people , I am part of this society , &quot; said Proc@@ tor , expla@@ ining that he was not choosing a life of isolation .
And on closer observation , the everyday world does not appear quite so &apos; un@@ -@@ v@@ eg@@ an &apos; - and ve@@ gans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed .
Fast food is also permitted .
Chi@@ ps are available everywhere !
&quot; Many don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab houses offer fal@@ af@@ el , or even veget@@ arian Yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says Proc@@ tor .
In a p@@ izz@@ eria he avoi@@ ds past@@ a dishes or just orders a p@@ izza without cheese , all just a question of hab@@ it .
Restaurants are slowly adapting to things .
&quot; When I began eating a v@@ eg@@ an diet 13 years ago , things were even more difficult , &quot; says the New Ze@@ al@@ ander , and he points out : &quot; You have to talk with people , make them aware &quot; .
&quot; If enough requests are made , they will perhaps be inc@@ lined to expand their menus , &quot; he hopes .
There are v@@ eg@@ an restaurants opening up , such as the Kom@@ bü@@ se in Mannheim or Café Vogel@@ frei .
Proc@@ tor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one v@@ eg@@ an dish on the menu .
Essen@@ tially , v@@ eg@@ an dishes are for everyone .
Anyone can eat them , they are the exact opposite of exclusive .
&quot; Me@@ at dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , as they rule others out , &quot; assessed Proc@@ tor .
&quot; If you want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scand@@ als from the outset , &quot; says Proc@@ tor .
However , purchasing v@@ eg@@ an products can be difficult to start with .
O@@ In@@ ce you come to understand that pe@@ an@@ uts , in particular , may also contain animal additives as a col@@ ou@@ rant , people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hur@@ d@@ les and pit@@ falls .
Therefore , for this reason and others , Re@@ ub@@ en Proc@@ tor and L@@ ars Th@@ om@@ sen have written a book . &quot; Ve@@ gan@@ is@@ si@@ mo - Tier@@ ische Inhalts@@ stoffe und ihre Alternativen &quot; ( Ve@@ gan@@ is@@ si@@ mo - Anim@@ al In@@ gre@@ di@@ ents and their Altern@@ atives ) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents .
&quot; You gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for &quot; . Proc@@ tor has learned that &quot; it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or st@@ um@@ ble &quot; .
Ve@@ gan@@ ism is an important moral comp@@ ass , which has an effect on your consciousness .
Perhaps he won &apos;t manage to help you break old hab@@ its altogether , but at least he manages to teach consumers to cri@@ tically question their hab@@ its .
Stock exchange operator Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X keeps its customers on ten@@ ter@@ ho@@ o@@ ks .
Trading at the Nas@@ da@@ q Op@@ tions Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon , German time .
In an announcement , the operator c@@ ited technical problems as the reason .
On the other ele@@ ven options markets , including two also operated by Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X , business continued as normal .
The most recent incident is the latest in a series of both small and large break@@ down@@ s suffered by the stock exchange operator .
As recently as last Tuesday , the Nas@@ da@@ q indi@@ ces were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors .
In August of this year there were two break@@ down@@ s in a single week .
First of all , US investment bank Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sent large quantities of incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems .
As a result , the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders .
Two days later , half of all stock dealing in the USA came to a stand@@ still for several hours , due to a computer failure in the Nas@@ da@@ q exchange .
Furthermore , last year the listing of Facebook on the stock exchange caused quite a fur@@ ore .
The Nas@@ da@@ q systems could not cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders , the Exchange Supervisory Authority established at a later date , imposing a record penalty of 10 million dollars on the company .
Kon@@ stanz : Cy@@ cli@@ st kno@@ cks over 6@@ 3-@@ year-old man
According to the police , the accident occurred on Thursday evening at around 10 : 00 p.m. , when a 26@@ -@@ year-old man was cycling illegally , on the left foot@@ path of the Bahn@@ hof@@ platz in the direction of Markt@@ stätte , on a ladies bicycle .
According to police , when a 6@@ 3-@@ year-old man suddenly step@@ ped out of a pu@@ b onto the foot@@ path , the cy@@ cli@@ st was unable to bra@@ ke in time .
During the subsequent col@@ li@@ sion , the pedestrian was thrown against the wall of the building , and then fell onto the ground , suffering a lac@@ er@@ ation to the head that measured around 15 cen@@ timet@@ res in length .
An amb@@ ul@@ ance team brought the injured man to the clin@@ ic for medical treatment .
British police serve Ass@@ ange with extra@@ dition notice
B@@ ti@@ tish police served an extra@@ dition notice today on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange , who has taken refuge in Ecu@@ ador &apos;s emb@@ assy in London and requested asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said they had served a &quot; sur@@ render notice &quot; on the 40-@@ year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
Ass@@ ange faces extra@@ dition to Sweden over sex crime alleg@@ ations , having exhau@@ sted his options under British law when the Supreme Court over@@ turned his appeal against extra@@ dition earlier this month .
F@@ ear@@ ing Stockholm would pass him on to the US , he sought refuge at Ecu@@ ador &apos;s emb@@ assy in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has &quot; served a sur@@ render notice upon a 40-@@ year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
He remains in breach of his ba@@ il conditions .
The emb@@ assy dec@@ lined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
Ass@@ ange fears he will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted from Sweden to the United States to face possible es@@ pi@@ on@@ age charges , after rele@@ asing more than 25@@ 0@@ ,000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks anti-@@ sec@@ rec@@ y website .
D@@ river spee@@ ding at 13@@ 0@@ mp@@ h with hot drink between legs fined £ 1,000
A motor@@ ist has been fined £ 1,000 for driving at up to 13@@ 0@@ mp@@ h ( 2@@ 10@@ km / h ) with a hot drink balanced between his legs .
Andrew Ho@@ wie , 35 , of Ti@@ p@@ tree , E@@ sse@@ x , was spot@@ ted driving his Merce@@ des B@@ enz on the A@@ 120 at Bra@@ in@@ tree on 27 May .
When police stopped him they discovered the ta@@ ke@@ away drink between his legs .
At Col@@ chester Magi@@ str@@ ates &apos; Court Ho@@ wie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention .
Seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six-@@ month driving ban .
Ho@@ wie was also ordered to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim sur@@ charge of £ 100 .
Ta@@ x on foreign property owners to bur@@ st London &apos;s bub@@ ble
The Treas@@ ury have provi@@ sionally co@@ sted out the C@@ G@@ T measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7 % rate of stam@@ p duty for homes co@@ sting more than £ 2@@ m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
Already the stam@@ p duty take for residential property in the bor@@ ou@@ ghs of West@@ min@@ ster and K@@ ens@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ el@@ sea , which stood at £ 7@@ 08 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , excee@@ ds the combined total for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North East , North West and Yor@@ k@@ shire and the Hum@@ ber put together .
Mr C@@ ook said : &quot; Following increases in stam@@ p duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-@@ avoid@@ ance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-@@ tax@@ ed irrespective of the effect of the out-@@ dated council tax system . &quot;
&quot; But this move could make some foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluc@@ tant to sell , &quot; he added .
Prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the aff@@ lu@@ ent south-@@ west London belt , which stret@@ ches from Ful@@ ham to W@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
Prices in central London continued to show steady year-@@ on-@@ year growth of 5.@@ 6 % but were over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed by a bur@@ ge@@ oning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and east ( 6.@@ 5 % ) all experiencing an up@@ tick , according to research from Sa@@ vi@@ ll@@ s .
Scienti@@ sts have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mood .
Ear@@ lier research had revealed that happy dogs wa@@ g their tails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while ner@@ vous dogs have a left-@@ dominated s@@ wish .
But now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spot and respond to these sub@@ tle tail differences .
Pro@@ f Georgi@@ o Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ scienti@@ st from the University of Tren@@ to , said : &quot; It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stim@@ uli that invo@@ kes positive or negative emotions . &quot;
Here we attempted to look at it in other species .
He added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-@@ handed movement and vice vers@@ a , and the two h@@ emis@@ pher@@ es played different roles in emotions .
To find out more about how dogs react to the lo@@ p-@@ sided tail w@@ ags of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they wat@@ ched films of other dogs .
They measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analy@@ sed their behaviour .
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
Pro@@ f Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : &quot; We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a nat@@ u@@ rali@@ stic version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to get rid of any other con@@ founding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
When the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the ta@@ il-@@ wag@@ ging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relaxed .
But when they spot@@ ted a tail ve@@ er predomin@@ antly to the left ( again from the ta@@ il-@@ s@@ wishing dog &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates picked up and they looked anxi@@ ous .
Pro@@ f Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were inten@@ tionally communic@@ ating with each other through these movements .
Instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and sh@@ ouldn &apos;t feel worried about .
He said : &quot; If you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail wag@@ ging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
The researchers say the findings could give owners , v@@ ets and train@@ ers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions .
Do@@ g behaviour expert John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol &apos;s school of veter@@ inary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines .
Last year a team from the University of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada , he said : &quot; Do@@ gs were more likely to approach a ro@@ bot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wa@@ g left rather than right , rather than becoming anxi@@ ous - the opposite way around to the Italian study . &quot;
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpre@@ ting the animals in the films or ro@@ bo@@ -@@ dogs as can@@ ines .
A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; While there is considerable evidence from many different m@@ amm@@ als that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ mer@@ ed out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .

P@@ ope Franc@@ is to name first car@@ din@@ als in February
P@@ ope Franc@@ is will create new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22 , the Vati@@ can announced Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ als are the high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking cl@@ ergy in the Catholic Church below the pop@@ e , and they &apos;re the ones who elect pop@@ es , so Franc@@ is will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .
There are now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
However , once a car@@ din@@ al reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pop@@ e -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors . &quot;
In a statement announ@@ cing the news , Father Feder@@ ico Lom@@ bar@@ di , a Vati@@ can spo@@ kes@@ man , said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als , known as a consi@@ story .
&quot; P@@ ope Franc@@ is has decided to communicate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke February &apos;s consi@@ story in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world , &quot; Lom@@ bar@@ di said .
Jack Val@@ ero of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors was likely to have dropped .
He said usually a pop@@ e would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
Next year &apos;s consi@@ story would be significant because it would be the first since Franc@@ is was elected in March this year , Val@@ ero said .
At the moment there is a sort of bi@@ as towards Europe and especially towards Italy .
&quot; It will be interesting to see whether the new P@@ ope will nom@@ inate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
For@@ ty percent of Roman Catho@@ lic@@ s are in South America , but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
The car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Franc@@ is formed the Council of Car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world t@@ asked with looking into ways to reform the church .
In the past the P@@ ope decided everything on his own .
&quot; Now Franc@@ is has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; Val@@ ero said .
He said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that Franc@@ is would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
But we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new .
Val@@ ero said pop@@ es typically elev@@ ated bis@@ hops from large places to the position of car@@ din@@ al but that Franc@@ is was &quot; full of sur@@ prises -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name . &quot;
GM rec@@ alls some new pi@@ ck@@ up trucks in U.S. to fix se@@ at@@ backs
General Motors Co is rec@@ alling nearly 19@@ ,000 of its all-@@ new 2014 Che@@ v@@ ro@@ let Silver@@ ado and GM@@ C Sierra pi@@ ck@@ up trucks to repair a problem with the manual rec@@ lining se@@ at@@ back , according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday .
On some of the trucks , the front seats may have a defect in the rec@@ lining mechanism .
As a result , the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restra@@ ints .
&quot; If the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restra@@ int may not properly protect occup@@ ants , increasing the risk of injury , &quot; according to the notice posted on the National High@@ way Traff@@ ic Safety Administration website .
The rec@@ alled models were built between August 1 and September 10 .
GM &apos;s truck roll@@ -@@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No@@ . 1 U.S. autom@@ aker since its 2009 bank@@ rupt@@ cy restructuring .
GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October .
N@@ HT@@ SA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-@@ day government sh@@ ut@@ down , which tem@@ pered auto sales growth in October .
Sales of the Silver@@ ado and Sierra trucks , which were re@@ designed for the 2014 model year , were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year , GM said on Friday .
In October , GM sold 4@@ 2,@@ 6@@ 60 Silver@@ ado and 16@@ ,@@ 50@@ 3 Sierra pi@@ ck@@ up trucks .
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
An Obama vot@@ er &apos;s c@@ ry of des@@ pair
I voted for President Obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama has had worthy efforts th@@ war@@ ted by G@@ O@@ P ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism
Ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism can &apos;t excuse Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website wo@@ es , dr@@ one attacks
Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign mem@@ o@@ ir is a sad remin@@ der of what might have been
N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel P. Mor@@ ris is a second-@@ year student at Harv@@ ard Medical School .
I &apos;m reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days .
It &apos;s a book that I thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ dru@@ ms of second-@@ year medical school , and rene@@ w in me a sense of hope .
It &apos;s called &quot; The Au@@ d@@ acity to W@@ in , &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ o@@ ir of Barack Obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
When I &apos;m finished with my patient wri@@ te-@@ ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your bre@@ ath away .
The election turned out to be a land@@ slide , and news anch@@ ors p@@ aus@@ ed to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
My class@@ m@@ ates cri@@ ed with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
A young team of vision@@ aries was headed for the White House , and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
And then I close the book .
C@@ utting to the present is a ru@@ de aw@@ ak@@ ening , like sn@@ app@@ ing out of a dream .
It &apos;s hard to remember those days of optim@@ ism -- they seem a distant memory , a sad remin@@ der of opportunities gone by .
Change indeed happened , in the years since I cast my first bal@@ lot .
It was simply nothing I could have ima@@ g@@ ined .
I credit Obama with great and varied accompli@@ sh@@ ments , from the passage of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell , &quot; to the killing of O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden .
Moreover , I believe that parti@@ san ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism has up@@ ended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Guant@@ an@@ amo Bay , among others .
But , after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and pe@@ ers , I &apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide .
I &apos;ve reached a point of political des@@ pair .
Republi@@ can ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor having d@@ ron@@ es strike innocent children overseas .
It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor prosec@@ uting whi@@ st@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers who reveal government wron@@ g@@ doing .
It cannot account for assass@@ in@@ ating An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without a trial , nor shi@@ r@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Ni@@ x@@ on Administration . &quot;
And , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act was signed into law .
I don &apos;t know if this is what I should have expected .
If , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradi@@ ct the political campaigns that prec@@ ede it .
Obviously , elec@@ tive office isn &apos;t a predictable course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the New@@ town mass@@ acre , will shape our public conversation .
Yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
That is what troub@@ les me most of all .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was exc@@ ited by his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a conf@@ using and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
I felt that a second term for Obama , free from the pressures of future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
Still , as Obama &apos;s approval rating s@@ ank below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder .
It makes me y@@ earn for the many promises that disappeared .
This week I was reading the portion of the book descri@@ bing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania primary .
At a post-@@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
&quot; I want us to get our mo@@ jo back , &quot; he said .
We &apos;ve got to remember who we are . &apos; 
It &apos;s five years later , Mr. President , and I couldn &apos;t agree with you more .
The opinions expressed in this comm@@ entary are solely those of N@@ ath@@ an@@ iel Mor@@ ris .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims PM Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has conflict of interest over par@@ ental leave scheme
Billi@@ on@@ aire M@@ P C@@ live Pal@@ mer says Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his par@@ ental leave scheme because his dau@@ gh@@ ters might get pregn@@ ant and benefit from it .
The mining magn@@ ate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Sen@@ ate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are a@@ xed .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ gh@@ ters stood to personally benefit from policies .
&quot; He &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid par@@ ental leave because if any of those dau@@ gh@@ ters get pregn@@ ant , he &apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , &quot; Mr Pal@@ mer said .
Two months after the election , the electoral commission officially declared Mr Pal@@ mer the winner of the Sun@@ shine Coast seat of Fair@@ fax by 53 votes , after a re@@ count .
Mr Pal@@ mer called for over@@ hau@@ l of election counting to speed up the process .

Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
&quot; We need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
Why is it that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have a system where you can walk in , pun@@ ch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that night ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of pen@@ cils to mark bal@@ lots .
Is it because they can ru@@ b out the result if someone doesn &apos;t like it ?
In this day and age having a pen@@ cil seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the Sun@@ shine Coast and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job .
Public office is about public service .
&quot; We seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
R@@ BS suspen@@ ds two fore@@ x traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspec@@ ted manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining tra@@ ction .
Some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including U@@ BS , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , Deutsche Bank and R@@ BS , have confirmed they are co-@@ operating with regulators in investigations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
The two traders would be the first R@@ BS employees to be suspended in the wi@@ dening probe that echo@@ es the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank lending manipulation scandal .
The bank , which dec@@ lined to comment on the suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-@@ operating fully with the F@@ CA and our other regulators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
Last month , people close to the situation said that R@@ BS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regul@@ ator , the Financial Con@@ duc@@ t Authority , sent to and from a former tra@@ der .
This tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sher , left R@@ BS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of fore@@ x spot trading at JP@@ Morgan .
Roh@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of European spot trading at C@@ iti , went on leave this week , while Mat@@ t Gar@@ din@@ er , a former senior currencies tra@@ der at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ BS , was suspended by Standard Char@@ tered this week .
None of these traders have been accused of any wron@@ g@@ doing .
Mr U@@ sher &apos;s instant message group included ban@@ kers at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and C@@ iti@@ group , people close to the situation said .
U@@ BS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regul@@ ator , Fin@@ ma , said it was investig@@ ating suspec@@ ted manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , Switzerland &apos;s competition authority We@@ ko , the F@@ CA , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at alleg@@ ations that ban@@ kers col@@ lu@@ ded to move the currencies market .
H@@ S@@ BC , C@@ iti@@ group , JP@@ Morgan and Credit Su@@ isse have also launched internal prob@@ es or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .
Ban@@ ks are sc@@ ouring through years &quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wron@@ g@@ doing .
News about the prob@@ es has r@@ att@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challeng@@ ed this year as low vol@@ atility in currencies cuts opportunities for specul@@ ators .
Some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manip@@ ulate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .
A senior tra@@ der said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ mentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;
The news came on the same day as Credit Su@@ isse announced it had dis@@ missed a tra@@ der at its London exchange tra@@ ded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6@@ m loss late last year .
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-@@ operating with its regulators .
&quot; We are confident the tra@@ der acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; Credit Su@@ isse said .
Ho@@ ar@@ ding on the Be@@ cht@@ le plot painted
A group belonging to the &quot; Schweizer Wi@@ ese &quot; citizen &apos;s initiative has given the ho@@ ar@@ ding on the Be@@ cht@@ le plot on the spa promenade in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b a fac@@ e-@@ lift .
In addition , they have cleaned and wi@@ dened the foot@@ path , a press release announced .
The planned covering of the di@@ la@@ pi@@ dated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons , as the premises were at risk of collap@@ sing .
Al@@ fred A@@ bel , who currently manages the site , arranged the &apos; fac@@ e-@@ lift &apos; in cooperation with his colleague , Rein@@ hard Dom@@ ke , from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
Before the citizen &apos;s initiative project , a b@@ anner with the message &quot; We are in favour &quot; was put up .
However , this did little to di@@ stra@@ ct the 20 or so members of the citizen &apos;s initiative from their project .
Their motto , on the large b@@ ill@@ board stated &quot; We are against un@@ finished buildings &quot; .
In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wi@@ ese - should the huge project one day fail .
Ch@@ at@@ ting with many people passing by the &quot; construction site &quot; , it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town , although many have the same questions as the citizen &apos;s initiative regarding the scale of the planned project .
However , they are beginning to re@@ sign themselves as the town continues to st@@ all in providing answers , said a statement from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
We have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact .
In May , in the meeting of the Town Council , he said that he fe@@ ared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wi@@ ese in the local referendum .
Some appear ut@@ terly fri@@ gh@@ tened by it , others perc@@ eive it as a &quot; b@@ lat@@ ant attempt to black@@ mail &quot; the population , continued the press release from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
The citizen &apos;s initiative than@@ ked those who don@@ ated paint and all those who l@@ ent a hand .
Ran@@ gn@@ ick s@@ col@@ ding for re@@ fs : Man@@ e is no di@@ ver
As satisfied as R@@ al@@ f Ran@@ gn@@ ick is with the present winning form of the Austrian Bundes@@ lig@@ a tab@@ le-@@ top@@ pers , Red Bul@@ l Salzburg , the S@@ porting Director of the &quot; Bul@@ ls &quot; expressed equal disappointment with the refer@@ ees .
&quot; There is currently a dangerous trend , with Man@@ e and Alan being du@@ b@@ bed as &apos; di@@ vers &apos; , &quot; he said at a press conference in Sal@@ burg on Thursday , in defence of the two tri@@ cky offensive players .
The most recent cause for Ran@@ gn@@ ick &apos;s criticism was the yellow card for Man@@ e at 3 : 0 against Grö@@ dig last Sunday , whereby the Sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese stri@@ ker was pen@@ alised for supposed play acting - ad@@ mit@@ tedly this was not justified , as shown by TV foot@@ age .
&quot; A b@@ lat@@ ant wrong decision , &quot; comm@@ ented Ran@@ gn@@ ick , who referred to H@@ ark@@ am as being &quot; completely out of his depth &quot; .
H@@ ark@@ am also played &quot; his part &quot; in the escal@@ ation between Salzburg Co@@ ach Ro@@ ger Schmi@@ dt and Grö@@ dig Trainer A@@ di H@@ üt@@ ter after the game .
He firmly defended his German comp@@ atri@@ ot : &quot; In each individual situation I would have beha@@ ved in the same way as Ro@@ ger Schmi@@ dt &quot; .
Schmi@@ dt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ h with H@@ üt@@ ter .
I do not know why .
&quot; After all , I was the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; emphasised the 4@@ 6-@@ year-old .
However , with regard to the winning run , Ran@@ gn@@ ick s@@ ang his team &apos;s pra@@ ises .
&quot; There are only two words for it : Re@@ ally good , &quot; he stated .
There is not a lot you can critic@@ ise .
Most of all , the manner in which the team is playing is impressive .
We must stay composed and keep it up .
There will hardly be any squ@@ ad changes in the winter transfer window .
There is no major reason to change anything .
&quot; Unless a player comes forward and expresses the desire to leave the club , &quot; explained Ran@@ gn@@ ick .
Supreme Court up@@ holds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama &apos;s signature health care law is constitutional .
By a 5-@@ 4 vote , the jus@@ tic@@ es ruled the Pati@@ ent Protection and Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government .
Chief Justice John Rober@@ ts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Jus@@ tic@@ es Sc@@ alia , Thomas , Ali@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy dis@@ s@@ ented .
The court also up@@ held the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase Medi@@ c@@ aid eli@@ gi@@ bility or else lose all federal Medi@@ c@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve .
The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
The law was vigor@@ ously opposed by each of the major Republi@@ can presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tive nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Norway : Norwe@@ gian village lights itself up with huge mir@@ rors
Using huge mir@@ rors , the residents of a Norwe@@ gian village have brought light to their dre@@ ary valley .
Due to the low level of sunshine , from autumn until spring the village of R@@ ju@@ kan in the V@@ est@@ f@@ j@@ ord valley normally langu@@ ishes in the sha@@ dows of the surrounding mountains .
With three gigan@@ tic mir@@ rors , each 45 metres t@@ all , a cent@@ uri@@ es-@@ old dream came true on Wednesday .
&quot; Finally ! &apos; , ra@@ ved Mayor Stein@@ ar Ber@@ gs@@ land at the inau@@ gu@@ ral ceremony , tel@@ ev@@ ised by broad@@ cast@@ er TV@@ 2 .
Some valley residents lay back on sun lo@@ ung@@ ers , while others safely put on their s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses .
Up until now , those hung@@ ry for sunshine in the winter had to travel to a nearby peak by cable car .
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Ander@@ sen presented the proposal of direc@@ ting the sun into the valley using mir@@ rors .
However , this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 19@@ 13 .
After several years of debate , the Town Council finally approved the project , which cost 5 million kr@@ one ( around EUR 6@@ 15@@ ,000 ) .
A similar construction has provided sunshine to the Italian alpine resort of Vi@@ gan@@ ella for a number of years .
The post is hardly ever emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days
&quot; Many citizens will not yet have noticed that red d@@ ots indicating a Sunday post collection are still to be found on many post boxes in the town centre and its districts . However , if you read the small print on the yellow boxes operated by Post AG , you will quickly find out that the boxes are no longer emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days and holidays , &quot; announced the F@@ DP .
An inquiry by the F@@ DP confirmed this .
Only the post boxes in front of the post office building at Ern@@ st-@@ Lud@@ wi@@ g-@@ Straße 36 and at Jak@@ ob@@ -@@ Müll@@ er-@@ Straße 1 in H@@ üt@@ ten@@ feld are still emp@@ tied .
Whether there are still Sunday collections in Hof@@ heim and Rosen@@ garten is not addressed in the inquiry by the F@@ DP .
The F@@ DP spo@@ kes@@ person for social and you@@ th-@@ related affairs , F@@ ritz Rö@@ hr@@ en@@ beck wants to dig deeper into this .
The Sunday collection is an important postal service , especially in the case of scheduled post .
&quot; The company is radi@@ cally and un@@ accep@@ t@@ ably cutting back on this , despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 .
Thomas Bit@@ tner , Liberal Party Parliamentary Group and Municip@@ al Association Chairman , is supporting his fellow group members : &quot; What anno@@ ys me , is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here &quot; .
In so doing , the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessibility .
&quot; At least the post boxes in the districts of Neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ ß and Rosen@@ garten must still be emp@@ tied on Sun@@ days , &quot; said Bit@@ tner and Rö@@ hr@@ en@@ beck in un@@ ison .
It is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a Sunday collection on foot .
In the Town Parliament , Rö@@ hr@@ en@@ beck asked whether the Town Council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter .
Mayor E@@ rich Ma@@ ier responded that the postal service had not communic@@ ated with Lam@@ per@@ thei@@ m .
To the best of his knowledge , however , there is a Sunday collection in Hof@@ heim .
Their party has spoken out in favour of priv@@ atisation .
&quot; Deci@@ sions will then be made elsewhere , &quot; said Ma@@ ier .
Frankfurt parking fees to increase dramatically
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be notic@@ e@@ ably more expensive .
The City Magi@@ str@@ ate today discussed a submission by the head of the department for transport , Stefan Maj@@ er ( Green Party ) .
According to the proposal , parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent .
This increase will not , however , be the result of raised prices , but rather the fact that time inter@@ val permitted by parking meters and ti@@ ck@@ eting machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .
The City Council must reach a decision on this in December .
The Ret@@ ail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce believes that this is &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
The option of parking right outside their businesses is &quot; an advantage to smaller re@@ tail@@ ers that must not be under@@ estimated . &quot; .
The Verkehr@@ sclub Deutschland ( German Traff@@ ic Club ) is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is &quot; completely appropriate and actually long over@@ due &quot; .
Local public transport will also become more expensive .
Freu@@ den@@ stadt : Qu@@ ick moves take hosts by surprise
With a s@@ lender squ@@ ad , the T@@ SV Freu@@ den@@ stadt Herren I team ( Men &apos;s First Team ) step@@ ped into the Schil@@ ler School Gy@@ mn@@ asi@@ um in Re@@ ut@@ lingen to face T@@ G G@@ ön@@ n@@ ingen of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b region .
The Al@@ b men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team .
However , it soon became evident that , due in part to their age , they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt team .
G@@ ön@@ n@@ ingen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-@@ positioned offensive moves .
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming clean@@ ly over the net from Simon Schen@@ k and E@@ du@@ ard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scrat@@ ch .
Cle@@ ar vic@@ tories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the su@@ peri@@ ority of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt team in all areas .
Fac@@ ed with this overwhelming and mat@@ ch-@@ determining performance , the third set was won following a somewhat t@@ ame and spi@@ rit@@ less performance , for a final score of 3 : 0 ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
On 2 November , when they play TV Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bron@@ n , who managed a clear victory in Nag@@ old , they will step onto the court to face a much stronger oppon@@ ent .
T@@ SV Freu@@ den@@ stadt I : Domini@@ k B@@ äu@@ er@@ le , Y@@ ann@@ ik Bü@@ ch@@ le , Sebastian D@@ öl@@ ker , Feli@@ x P@@ äl@@ chen , Stefan R@@ äl@@ ler , Simon Schen@@ k and E@@ du@@ ard Schulz .
In the B Class , two teams from Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bron@@ n and Freu@@ den@@ stadt faced off in the M@@ urg@@ tal@@ halle in Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bron@@ n .
They produced a hard-@@ fought two-@@ hour match .
Ner@@ ves on both sides , particularly when receiving the ball , resulted in errors and lost points ; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments over@@ eag@@ ern@@ ess saw potential points wa@@ sted .
However , in this even@@ ly matched game , the great physical effort of Mar@@ cus B@@ las@@ ut@@ to &apos;s T@@ SV team proved decisive in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams .
Ma@@ intenance day at the small &apos; Eng@@ län@@ der@@ h@@ üt@@ te@@ &apos;
For what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hot@@ zen@@ wald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small Eng@@ län@@ der@@ hü@@ tte ( Engli@@ sh@@ man &apos;s Cot@@ tage ) in I@@ bach
Following suggestions from the population , the of the valley in the area of the cot@@ tage was to be cle@@ ared , said Mayor Hel@@ mut Kaiser .
According to Kaiser , many hi@@ kers refer to this area as the show@@ piece of the Schlu@@ chten@@ stei@@ g , where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views .
He than@@ ked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature ,
He is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .
At the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration .
This environmental aspect was explained by Frie@@ deri@@ ke Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it of the Department of Nature Con@@ servation of the Freiburg Regional Council , following the gre@@ eting by Regional Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Til@@ man Bol@@ la@@ cher , who had taken on the role of pat@@ ron and wished the campaign every success .
According to Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , the tourist objective of the vision coinci@@ ded with the goal of preserving the now extremely over@@ grown old All@@ mend gra@@ zing past@@ ure , with its specific protected habit@@ ats , through its opening and connection to the still existing gra@@ zing land .
Cer@@ tain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies or gra@@ s@@ shop@@ pers , cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas .
They require these clear path@@ ways in order to preserve their species .
Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned bio@@ sphere area .
The current measures do not integrate seam@@ lessly into these plans .
A bio@@ sphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Un@@ esco status , and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days .
After the various statements , forest ran@@ ger Christoph W@@ eh@@ le and Life Project manager Cor@@ ne@@ lia Bisch@@ off divided the hel@@ pers into groups .
The larger trees had been cut down in advance , although forest trac@@ tors were on-@@ call if required .
One group of hel@@ pers were to take care of the cle@@ arance of j@@ uni@@ per bus@@ hes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall .
The objective was to create a clear view at the view@@ point .
L@@ öff@@ ingen : Kö@@ pf@@ ler still the only candidate
Information online : Although L@@ öff@@ ingen , the small town of Ba@@ ar , with its 7,@@ 5@@ 14 residents , can be described as having an in@@ tact infrastructure , forwar@@ d-@@ looking school , youth and senior citizens policies and its own municipal energy companies , thus far no-@@ one has registered as a second may@@ oral candidate .
So far , the only candidate to succeed Mayor Nor@@ bert Bru@@ gger , who is no longer running on account of his age , is 4@@ 6-@@ year-old ban@@ ker and business econom@@ ist Di@@ eter Kö@@ pf@@ ler from L@@ öff@@ ingen .
The deadline for applications is Monday 11 November , at 6 : 00 p.m .
Google , Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ wei su@@ ed over Nor@@ tel patents
The group that own@@ s thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents filed a bar@@ rage of patent law@@ suits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google , the company it out@@ bid in the Nor@@ tel bank@@ rupt@@ cy auction .
Rock@@ star , the con@@ sortium that bought the Nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , su@@ ed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HT@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ wei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rock@@ star is jointly owned by Apple , Microsoft , Black@@ berry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused of inf@@ ring@@ ing seven patents .
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising , the law@@ suit said , which is the core of Google &apos;s search business .
Represent@@ atives for Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ wei , HT@@ C and Rock@@ star could not immediately be reached .
Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ wei and HT@@ C all manufacture phones that operate on Google &apos;s Andro@@ id operating system , which compet@@ es fi@@ erc@@ ely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .
In 2011 Google placed an initial $ 900 million bid for Nor@@ tel &apos;s patents .
Google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
After losing out to Rock@@ star on the Nor@@ tel patents , Google went on to acquire Motor@@ ola Mob@@ ility for $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a deal driven partly by Motor@@ ola &apos;s library of patents .
&quot; Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the pat@@ ent@@ s-@@ in-@@ suit at auction , Google has inf@@ ring@@ ed and continues to infrin@@ ge , &quot; the law@@ suit said .
Rock@@ star is seeking increased damages against Google , as it claims Google &apos;s patent infringement is will@@ ful , according to the complaint .
Egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
Moh@@ amed Mor@@ si takes the o@@ ath of office but his day of tri@@ umph is unlikely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in Egypt .
IS@@ LA@@ M@@ IS@@ T Moh@@ amed Mor@@ si promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; as he took the o@@ ath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president , succ@@ ee@@ ding Ho@@ sn@@ i M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak who was ou@@ sted 16 months ago .
At his inau@@ gu@@ ration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Mor@@ si also became the Arab world &apos;s first freely elected Islam@@ ist president and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
He took the o@@ ath before the court &apos;s 18 black@@ -@@ ro@@ bed judges in its Ni@@ le-@@ side seat built to res@@ emble an ancient Egyptian temple .
&quot; We asp@@ ire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , &quot; Mor@@ si said during a sol@@ em@@ n ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Mor@@ si , a 6@@ 0-@@ year-old US-@@ trained engineer from the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , a fundament@@ alist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inc@@ eption as an out@@ la@@ wed organisation har@@ sh@@ ly targeted by succ@@ essive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and poli@@ c@@ emen guar@@ ded the building as Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11@@ am local time in a small motor@@ c@@ ade .
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to che@@ er the new president and , in a departure from the presidential p@@ om@@ p of the M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak years , traffic was only briefly hal@@ ted to allow his motor@@ c@@ ade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
Deri@@ ded as the Bro@@ ther@@ hood &apos;s un@@ char@@ ism@@ atic &quot; spare ty@@ re , &quot; his personal pre@@ stige has sur@@ ged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 u@@ pris@@ ing against the authoritarian M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak .
&quot; Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; Mor@@ si , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the woo@@ d-@@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the o@@ ath of office .
Mor@@ si later trav@@ elled to Cairo University where he was to make his inau@@ gu@@ ration address .
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national an@@ them as he stood to attention .
Military rul@@ er Fiel@@ d Mar@@ sh@@ al Hussein Tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i was in atten@@ dance .
His arrival was gre@@ eted with chan@@ ts of , &quot; The army and the people are one hand , &quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main lec@@ ture room .
Establi@@ shed in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of secular education , Cairo University later became a stron@@ gh@@ old of Islam@@ ist student groups in the 1970s .
Mor@@ si took a symbolic o@@ ath on Friday in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that ended M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and vo@@ wed to rec@@ la@@ im presidential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military council that took over from the ou@@ sted leader .
But by agre@@ eing to take the official o@@ ath before the court , rather than before parliament as is custom@@ ary , he is bo@@ wing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
Mor@@ si &apos;s speech in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square was filled with dramatic pop@@ u@@ list gest@@ ures .

Wor@@ ker falls from lad@@ der : seriously injured
On Thursday , a 5@@ 1-@@ year-old worker in E@@ g@@ gel@@ s@@ berg fell from a lad@@ der while replacing a broken external sensor and was seriously injured .
The man from Lam@@ pre@@ cht@@ sh@@ au@@ sen wanted to replace a broken heating sensor on the external fac@@ ade of a guest house .
As he was climbing the lad@@ der , which was re@@ sting on the roof gut@@ tering , it sli@@ pped away and the man fell onto the concrete below .
He suffered serious inj@@ uries and was taken by the &quot; Christop@@ hor@@ us 6 &quot; rescue helicop@@ ter to the Salzburg Regional Hospital .
Rap@@ ist in South Africa : two life sentences
N@@ ine months after the brutal rap@@ e and mu@@ tilation of a 17@@ -@@ year-old girl in South Africa , the perpet@@ r@@ ator was condemned to two life sentences on Friday .
This was reported by broad@@ cast@@ er SA@@ BC .
The victim later died as a result of the serious inj@@ uries .
Johannes Kan@@ a had already been found guilty of the crime at the start of the week .
The crime had caused nation@@ wide hor@@ ror .
The then 2@@ 1-@@ year-old had rap@@ ed An@@ ene Boo@@ y@@ sen in February in an industrial estate in Bre@@ das@@ dor@@ p , near Cap@@ et@@ own .
For 14 hours , doctors batt@@ led to save the life of the victim , ultimately in v@@ ain .
The sight of the young girl was so horri@@ fic that the car@@ ers and nur@@ sing staff required psychological support .
During the trial , Kan@@ a admitted to having been in a bar with Boo@@ y@@ sen on the night of the attack .
He also admitted to be@@ ating and rap@@ ing her , however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
The police had initially assumed that there were multiple attack@@ ers , however , they released two sus@@ pects from cu@@ sto@@ dy as the evidence against them was insufficient .
During the proceedings the public prosec@@ ution also emphasised that they were convinced that Kan@@ a was alone at the time of the attack .
Rap@@ es are almost part of everyday life in South Africa : There are around 64@@ ,000 reports of sexual ass@@ ault every year .
This is almost ten times as many as in Germany , although with a population of 82 million people , Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa ( 50 million ) .
Police and women &apos;s associations in South Africa , however , estimate the number of un@@ reported cases of sexual ass@@ ault to be 10-@@ 25 times as high .
J@@ umb@@ o visits the home of Black Forest ham
J@@ umb@@ o on the search for the &quot; world &apos;s best ham &quot; : For the TV programme &quot; Galileo &quot; , the Pro@@ 7 star visited B@@ onn@@ dorf .
The present@@ er established one thing right from the outset : The most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of por@@ k - tur@@ bo f@@ atten@@ ing does not provide a good basis for this .
Can ham bought in a super@@ market be as good as a quality product ?
Ul@@ i , bo@@ ss of the large ham factory in Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , explained to J@@ umb@@ o how the B@@ onn@@ dorf company , &quot; Ad@@ ler &quot; , operates .
&quot; Germany &apos;s mo@@ st-@@ loved ham , &quot; said J@@ umb@@ o , presenting the Black Forest ham .
He could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat .
J@@ umb@@ o also had to first dis@@ inf@@ ect his hands before he could reach for the mic@@ roph@@ one .
J@@ umb@@ o seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in Wald@@ shut
&quot; Here they work with huge quantities , &quot; comm@@ ented the television producers , aston@@ ished by the mass production of Black Forest ham .
16@@ ,000 jo@@ ints of meat per week speak for themselves .
Wei@@ ght , fat content and colour : Ul@@ i explained what was required for the best quality .
The majority of the pig@@ s are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months old .
Tele@@ vision with standards ?
Even specific details such as the p@@ H value of the meat play a role .
The dark@@ er the meat , the higher the p@@ H value .
&quot; I would be curi@@ ous what would happen if you were to measure Rober@@ to Blan@@ co , &quot; said J@@ umb@@ o cy@@ n@@ ically .
Here the standard of private television production is presented in its pu@@ rest form .
Nonetheless , it is worth watching .
The viewer sees that jo@@ ints are still car@@ ved by hand .
After all : Black Forest ham traditionally arri@@ ves on the shel@@ f bon@@ eless .
The secret of the ham is the mix of her@@ bs combined with salt .
The appearance of the smoking tower and fur@@ n@@ ace remind J@@ umb@@ o of a sub@@ marine .
The tri@@ ck : Here fi@@ r branches in the smo@@ ker provide the special flav@@ our of Black Forest ham .
After 20 days in the smoke , the ham is finally almost black .
&quot; And now the sli@@ ce will disappear inside J@@ umb@@ o , &quot; he said , announ@@ cing his sam@@ pling of the product .
&quot; That is really delicious , &quot; said the TV star in conclusion .
All those involved will be happy with that evaluation .
Th@@ ought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
F@@ light Centre seem to be bu@@ cking the trend .
The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holi@@ day@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 3@@ 25 million and $ 3@@ 40 million , compared with the $ 30@@ 5 million to $ 3@@ 15 million it previously forecast .
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 29@@ 0.@@ 4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
Managing director Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner said F@@ light Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-@@ business travel .
&quot; Y@@ ear@@ -@@ to-@@ date , our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-@@ year earnings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically our largest profit gener@@ ators .
In Australia the leisure business re@@ bound@@ ed during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market .
Similarly in the UK , F@@ light Centre &apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
Its US business had recover@@ ed its losses during its seas@@ on@@ ally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consec@@ utive full year profit .
F@@ light Centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
Scho@@ ols urged to focus more on ma@@ ths , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are play , a 19th century novel , Romanti@@ c po@@ etry and contemporary British fiction from 19@@ 14 onwards .
The ex@@ am will also feature &quot; un@@ seen texts &quot; to encourage wider reading ;
A combined English literature and language course will be scra@@ pped .
From 2015 , pupils will be required to take a stand@@ alone G@@ CS@@ E in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
The Department for Education is due to release the new sy@@ ll@@ abuses in English and ma@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to under@@ go a radical over@@ hau@@ l .
It will make changes in other core subjects next year .
In a separate move , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the exam@@ s regul@@ ator , will un@@ v@@ eil a sha@@ ke-@@ up of the structure of G@@ CS@@ Es , with a new gra@@ ding system and less cour@@ se@@ work .
Spe@@ aking in the summer , Michael Go@@ ve , the Education Secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insi@@ sting G@@ CS@@ Es would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
Studies show that English schools devote less time to ma@@ ths - 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
By comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and pupils do around 13@@ 8 hours in Singapore .
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to ma@@ ths , Co@@ alition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths G@@ CS@@ E - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in le@@ ague tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
The sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathemati@@ cs .
Beautiful animals and delicious tar@@ ts enti@@ ce
The most beautiful rab@@ bits of various bre@@ eds and colour@@ ings will be presented at the District Exhibition this weekend in the community centre .
The evalu@@ ations were already made on Thursday .
Once again , the W@@ 5@@ 14 local association are organising this large exhibition .
Here bree@@ ders from the clubs in the District of So@@ est will be exhibit@@ ing their best animals , while young private individuals from Wi@@ ck@@ eder are also showing their rab@@ bits .
On Thursday , six adju@@ dic@@ ators assessed the numerous rab@@ bits and were able to assi@@ gn awards to the exceptional animals .
The visitors to the show will be kept well informed , with the evalu@@ ations of all animals posted on their c@@ ages .

Sal@@ em : Johann@@ a Rah@@ ner at the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ cus@@ sion Forum
At the next E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ cus@@ sion Forum on Monday 21 October , in the Neues Museum des Sch@@ losses ( New Castle Museum ) , the focus will be on the topic of &quot; To hell with H@@ ell - The@@ ological refle@@ ctions on how we now approach the notion of end times &quot; .
The speaker will be Johann@@ a Rah@@ ner .
The E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Dis@@ cus@@ sion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Prote@@ stant churches in Sal@@ em , the Sal@@ em Castle and the Lake Con@@ stance District Cultural Office .
At the forum , Johann@@ a Rah@@ ner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .
While people in past centuries were over@@ ly conscious of it , focusing on the pictures of he@@ aven and hell &quot; that up until now have defined our ideas &quot; , contemporary prop@@ he@@ tic teaching on the hope of consum@@ mation is characterised more by a certain b@@ ash@@ fulness , or even spe@@ ech@@ less@@ ness .
&quot; The greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critics , &quot; said the speaker .
They have &quot; provided us with so many question marks , that we seem to have lost our exc@@ lam@@ ation marks &quot; .
Johann@@ a Rah@@ ner continued : &quot; However , the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death &quot; .
Associ@@ ated with this is the matter of that lon@@ ging , &quot; that dreams that everything will be good at the end &quot; .
Johann@@ a Rah@@ ner , born in 1962 in Baden-@@ Baden , studied Catholic the@@ ology and bi@@ ology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig &apos;s University in Freiburg .
In 1997 she gradu@@ ated as a doctor of the@@ ology , also in Freiburg .
A post-@@ doc@@ toral lec@@ turing qualification in fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ umen@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the West@@ f@@ ali@@ an Wilhelm &apos;s University .
Since 2010 , Johann@@ a Rah@@ ner has occupied a Chair for System@@ atic The@@ ology in the Institute for Catholic The@@ ology at the University of Kas@@ sel .
Gei@@ s@@ lingen : More than 100 young Catho@@ lic@@ s from Kl@@ einer Heu@@ berg stand together in the confirmation of their profession of faith
In two services , 101 15 and 16-@@ year-@@ olds from the Am Kl@@ einen Heu@@ berg past@@ oral care unit were confirmed .
In the morning , the service was accompanied by the Lau@@ dat@@ o@@ -S@@ i Group , while the afternoon service featured &apos; The Spirit &apos; youth cho@@ ir .
Upon receiving the confirmation sac@@ ra@@ ment , the young people accepted their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit .
Over recent months those being confirmed , under the direction of De@@ acon R@@ einer D@@ eh@@ ner and the assistance of several church members , have been preparing for the special day .
In various projects , they learned of the different tasks involved in Christian church life and attended the Youth Day in Unter@@ ma@@ cht@@ al together .
I@@ ll@@ men@@ see : Second mountain bike race enth@@ uses participants
In fantastic weather , 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to I@@ ll@@ men@@ see to take on the circuit , over the hills and around the lake .
This was announced by Ul@@ rich Kno@@ bel of the organising I@@ ll@@ men@@ see Sports Club .
Among the participants there were also numerous am@@ ateur cy@@ cli@@ sts who wanted the chance to practice their ho@@ b@@ by in a competitive environment , in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 met@@ re climb .
Two top-@@ class junior cy@@ cli@@ sts were also in the starting line-@@ up for the competition : Feli@@ x Ba@@ der from Bad Wald@@ see and Pas@@ cal Tre@@ u@@ bel from A@@ ach@@ -@@ Linz came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the German Champ@@ ion@@ ships .
The pair managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations .
As was the case the previous year , Feli@@ x Ba@@ der managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance race
Once again , Pas@@ cal Tre@@ u@@ bel took second place .
In the ladies &apos; race it was Ther@@ esa Du@@ elli of Team Alb@@ traum who managed to take top place on the po@@ dium .
In second and third places were An@@ ne A@@ del from I@@ ll@@ men@@ see and Leon@@ ie Treiber from O@@ w@@ ingen .
The increasing number of ri@@ ders that live or work in the area is a fantastic development .
And it was not only about top performance - the entire range of athle@@ tic ability was represented .
Particip@@ ants &apos; ages were also wide-ranging , with the young@@ est star@@ ters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70 .
This year , there were even more absolute top athle@@ tes at the starting line for the main race .
Four cy@@ cli@@ sts managed to break away from the top regional rac@@ ers .
These included Phili@@ pp Pan@@ ger@@ l , a semi-@@ professional mountain bi@@ ker from the Black Tus@@ k Racing Team .
Together with a team m@@ ate , Pan@@ ger@@ l has already twice been cro@@ wn@@ ed World Champion in the 12-@@ hour race .
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline .
Also competing was Rol@@ and B@@ aller@@ st@@ edt , who has already claimed two German du@@ ath@@ lon champ@@ ion@@ ships .
After 45 kilometres and a climb of 900 metres , the leading ri@@ ders were neck and neck on the final straight in front of the Drei@@ -@@ Se@@ en-@@ Hall .
Pan@@ ger@@ l sp@@ ed over the finish line in first place .
Only one second later , the experienced B@@ aller@@ st@@ edt managed to take second place in the overall stand@@ ings .
Her@@ mann and War@@ th@@ mann then reached the finish line simultaneously to take joint third in the overall stand@@ ings .
In the ladies &apos; race , Christi@@ ane Coh@@ s@@ mann achieved the fastest time in the main race .
Are@@ ane B@@ ler@@ sch from Bin@@ zwan@@ gen took second place , ahead of Nat@@ a@@ sch@@ a Werner from Stuttgart .
Ath@@ le@@ tes and assi@@ stants seemed very satisfied with the smooth and well-@@ organised running of the event .
Tre@@ kking through mu@@ d , rivers and jung@@ le to provide free medical care
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ welle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cam@@ ero@@ on
B@@ welle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There aren &apos;t many doctors in the west African country ; just one for every 5,000 people
C@@ ast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ welle is one of the top 10 CN@@ N Her@@ oes of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 Her@@ oes , to be CN@@ N Her@@ o of the Year .
That person will receive $ 25@@ 0@@ ,000 to continue their extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Geor@@ ges B@@ welle wat@@ ched his ill father sli@@ p in and out of consciousness , traveling to hospitals that weren &apos;t equipped to help him .
J@@ ame@@ f B@@ welle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Y@@ ao@@ unde , Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos;s capital .
He suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hem@@ atom@@ a that would affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; There were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in Cam@@ ero@@ on , &quot; Geor@@ ges B@@ welle said .
We would have taken him out of Cam@@ ero@@ on if we had the money .
Instead , B@@ welle spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy , &quot; B@@ welle said .
You can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are a lot of patients .
Some people can die because they are waiting .
The situation has@@ n &apos;t changed much since B@@ welle &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
For comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 4@@ 13 people .
And even if they could see a physi@@ cian , many Cam@@ ero@@ oni@@ ans couldn &apos;t afford it .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-@@ quarters of the country &apos;s heal@@ th-@@ care spending is private .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; B@@ welle said .
And with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
Se@@ eing his father and so many of his country@@ men suffer , B@@ welle was determined to do something about it .
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ welle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a vas@@ cular sur@@ ge@@ on in Y@@ ao@@ unde &apos;s Central Hospital .
And he started a non@@ profit , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ IM@@ E , that tra@@ vels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32@@ ,000 people .
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans , tie medical supplies to the ro@@ o@@ fs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need .
Their luck doesn &apos;t always hold out .
They &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d more than once .
But when they arrive , they receive a true her@@ oes &apos; welcome : a fe@@ ast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer .
In these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and B@@ welle -- with his big s@@ mile and bound@@ less energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .
The next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
&quot; We are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; B@@ welle said .
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village , and they &apos;re coming on foot .
Each of these weekend clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care .
Many people are treated for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutrition , di@@ abetes , par@@ asi@@ tes and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others might receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , a pair of don@@ ated ey@@ eg@@ l@@ asses or free birth certificates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many im@@ pover@@ ished families simply can &apos;t afford .
In the evenings , the team will do simple sur@@ ger@@ ies with local an@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
Oper@@ ations are usually done in a school@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
With the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ing equipment , B@@ welle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
It &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; They are be@@ ating dru@@ ms all night to keep us awa@@ ke and continue our work , &quot; B@@ welle said .
On Sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work .
The group -- a mix of Cam@@ ero@@ onian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
One man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again .
&quot; This will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
In addition to holding these weekend clin@@ ics and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on , B@@ welle also works nights at private medical clin@@ ics around Y@@ ao@@ unde .
It &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his non@@ profit ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; I &apos;m not sure when he sle@@ ep@@ s , &quot; said K@@ atie O &apos;@@ M@@ alley , a second-@@ year medical student from Dre@@ xel University in Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a and volunte@@ er with B@@ welle &apos;s group .
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
For medical and nur@@ sing students such as O &apos;@@ M@@ alley , who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ welle on his missions , it &apos;s a hand@@ s-@@ on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home .
&quot; We &apos;ve been able to sc@@ ru@@ b in on sur@@ ger@@ ies where we help blo@@ t blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ welle , &quot; O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said .
That &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in America as a second-@@ year medical student .
The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cam@@ ero@@ on , often arriving with don@@ ated medical supplies .
But once they arrive in Y@@ ao@@ unde , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by B@@ welle .
&quot; He &apos;s a her@@ o , without a doubt , &quot; O &apos;@@ M@@ alley said .
He gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the Cam@@ ero@@ on people is ever@@ lasting .
For B@@ welle , the near@@ -@@ constant work@@ load isn &apos;t a hard@@ ship .
Hel@@ ping others live happ@@ ier lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; B@@ welle said .
And I think about my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
To make people lau@@ gh , to reduce the pain , that &apos;s why I &apos;m doing this .

Ma@@ stering the struggle to perfec@@ tion .
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s novel &quot; The Old Man and the Sea &quot; , is perfectly suited to Hor@@ st Jan@@ son .
Jan@@ son is an old hand himself when it comes to his profession , the art of acting .
The old man , Santiago , is the best there is when it comes to fishing .
As such , the pair complement one another super@@ bly .
You almost think that you can see the fol@@ ds in the old man &apos;s neck , of which young fisher@@ man Man@@ olo speaks .
When Santiago si@@ ts arch@@ ed over on the chair , tired of life , this is a genuine emo@@ tion for Jan@@ son .
Furthermore , the role of the old fisher@@ man is a character role , through and through , which Jan@@ son masters excell@@ ently .
Hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a coura@@ geous man who doesn &apos;t give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will .
For long periods , Jan@@ son is the only perform@@ er on the stage .
He manages to focus the audience &apos;s attention on himself , with the result that his mon@@ olo@@ gues never become bor@@ ing , not even for just a moment .
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bot@@ tles , illumin@@ ated in blue .
Director J@@ ens Has@@ sel@@ mann has the old man in the boat perform in front of Fischer@@ dorf .
During the course of the performance he has the respective active scene illumin@@ ated . Santiago &apos;s cabin and the bar of singer Mar@@ ie-@@ Lu@@ ise Gun@@ st , who s@@ ings of the Cuban lifestyle , with your songs and beautiful voice .
The four musicians accompany with Cuban rhyth@@ ms and guests at the bar at the same time .
Tourism : Des@@ cent to the Rom@@ ans
Ben@@ e@@ ath Cologne , a se@@ wage channel from Roman times , measuring around 120 metres in length , has been preserved .
Anyone visiting Cologne cannot miss the cathedral .
The two towers , measuring around 15@@ 7 metres , extend into the heav@@ ens , making it Europe &apos;s second t@@ all@@ est church building .
However , only a few visitors who mar@@ vel at the two orn@@ ate church towers realise that there is much to discover bene@@ ath the cathedral .
Ra@@ iner Schul@@ ze is an expert when it comes to the Cologne under@@ world .
The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre , right at the cathedral .
The tour begins in a somewhat un@@ spectacular fashion : &quot; We begin in the underground car park , &quot; says Schul@@ ze .
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car@@ -@@ friendly city , and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too t@@ all .
The majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hur@@ ry past the Roman re@@ lic@@ s and simply drop off their car .
However , anyone who takes a closer look on parking level D@@ 2 will discover an archaeological site , c@@ ord@@ oned off by metal rail@@ ings .
Ru@@ ins measuring five metres t@@ all , made from stones around the size of the pal@@ m of your hand , are waiting to be discovered .
&quot; These are rem@@ n@@ ants of the Roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century A.@@ D , &quot; explains Schul@@ ze .
Before returning to day@@ light , Schul@@ ze has participants take a gl@@ ance into a dark , 15-@@ met@@ re sha@@ ft on the upper parking level .
This is the well of the old cathedral , which is barely noticed at all these days .
The next stop on the tour is the pra@@ et@@ orium , where participants once again desc@@ end to the dep@@ ths .
Here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the Alps , the Pra@@ et@@ or of the C@@ CA@@ A .
One visitor wants to know what C@@ CA@@ A means .
&quot; The ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; Col@@ onia Clau@@ dia Ar@@ a Agri@@ pp@@ inen@@ si@@ um &quot; , which is basically amounts to &quot; City under Roman Law and City of the Agri@@ pp@@ ini@@ ans , founded under Emperor Clau@@ di@@ us at the Site of the Al@@ tar@@ s for the Imperial Cul@@ t &quot; .
And the Pra@@ et@@ orium refers to the former Govern@@ or &apos;s Palace and the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .
From the exhibition v@@ esti@@ bu@@ le , a tunnel leads to the preserved Roman se@@ wer , measuring around 120 metres in length .
&quot; If you want you can take a peaceful stroll along a section of the so-called Clo@@ aca Maxim@@ a , &quot; says Schul@@ ze , encouraging the guests .
Schul@@ ze has one more surprise .
Once he has collected the key from the information desk , he leads the group to a 16-@@ met@@ re , accessible sha@@ ft .
&quot; We are now in the Mik@@ we , a ri@@ tual Jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
The Jewish con@@ gre@@ gation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the ground@@ water essential for ri@@ tual washing .
To this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read at the lower end of the Mik@@ we , the origins of which trace back to the eigh@@ th century .
The Mik@@ we is to form part of an archaeological area at the Town Hall Square , on which construction work is set to begin shortly .
However , it will be a few years before it is complete .
Le@@ g almost h@@ ack@@ ed off : Ro@@ cker re@@ trial
A bloo@@ dy attack within the &apos; Ro@@ cker &apos; scene is to be re-@@ investigated after more than four years .
Pro@@ ce@@ edings for attempted murder , grie@@ vous bo@@ di@@ ly harm and material damage , brought against two 30-@@ year-@@ olds have begun before the Frankfurt District Court .
They are being accompanied by strict security precau@@ tions .
The accused initially remained silent .
They are said to have been active within the Ro@@ cker scene and to have at the time belon@@ ged to the Ban@@ di@@ dos .
The Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor accused them of having stab@@ bed and be@@ aten three men in a car in Fin@@ ow@@ fur@@ t , together with unknown accompli@@ ces .
All the victims were seriously injured , with one man almost losing a leg .
The victims were said to have belon@@ ged to the competing gang , the H@@ ell &apos;s Angel@@ s .
One is said to have been a high-@@ ranking member from Berlin .
It seems that the attack was prec@@ eded by a car ch@@ ase involving several cars .
According to accus@@ ations , this was part of a tur@@ f war and represented a demonstration of power .
The two accused were acqu@@ it@@ ted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012 .
At the time , a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloo@@ dy feu@@ d .
The as@@ sail@@ ants had worn mas@@ ks and had not been recognised .
The Federal Supreme Court repe@@ aled the verdi@@ ct following an appeal by the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re-@@ trial .
One of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another off@@ ence .
Pro@@ ce@@ edings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime .
The police inspec@@ tor responsible at the time was invited as a witness .
The central point of focus was on mobile phone convers@@ ations between the accused and third parties , which the police had inter@@ cep@@ ted .
What makes things difficult is that Rock@@ ers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court - they say absolutely nothing .
This also applies in the case of the victims .
In the first trial , only one of the victims spoke out .
When asked , Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor Stefan Gol@@ fier of the Frankfurt ( Oder ) Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial .
A further ele@@ ven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial .
The thro@@ wa@@ way society does not think
The night was long , the music loud and the atmosphere good , but at some point everyone has to go home .
Exc@@ ept : In the stom@@ ach@@ s of those in the passenger and back seats , hunger strikes .
Of course , this may be down to the od@@ d cocktail or glass of bub@@ bly !
So what could be more natural than to cas@@ ually pull into the next dri@@ ve-@@ through to pick yourself up a little treat ?
I admit , I am right with you with it comes to pi@@ cking up some fast food late at night , or early in the morning as the case may be .
A few chips , a co@@ ke , a burger - and then straight home and into bed !
However , on the way home the clear differences between me and other hung@@ ry clu@@ b@@ bers become evident .
What is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window ? !
At the weekend in particular , dis@@ car@@ ded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .
&quot; Why is this ? &quot; I ask myself .
Are the people too stup@@ id to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rub@@ b@@ ish bin ?
After all , waste paper does more than spo@@ il the landscape .
Bag@@ s have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers , thus causing accidents .
However , the so-called &quot; thro@@ wa@@ way society &quot; does not think about such things . They probably do not even know what the term even means .
If you are often out and about in the evening , more often than not with several people in the car , you will know what a back seat can look like after having parti@@ ed through the night : clothes , bot@@ tles and other rub@@ b@@ ish begin to pi@@ le up .
A few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no-@@ one wants to tra@@ mp@@ le through other peoples &apos; le@@ f@@ to@@ ver food .
I can see the day coming when towns and municip@@ alities will get fed up cle@@ aring up - and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags .
Obama &apos;s Health Care Wal@@ k Back
A@@ mid a fi@@ restor@@ m of criticism , President Obama yesterday wal@@ ked back his oft@@ -@@ repeated , un@@ ambiguous promise that &quot; if you like your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notic@@ es from their providers , Republi@@ cans have sl@@ amm@@ ed the president in recent days for misleading the American public .
Yesterday , Obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original ple@@ dge .
&quot; For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in Boston .
Ad@@ dres@@ sing what he called the &quot; fl@@ ur@@ ry in the news &quot; about the cancell@@ ations , Obama urged Americans receiving these notic@@ es to shop for new coverage in the market@@ place .
Most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projec@@ ted .
&quot; You &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;t meet the new standards required under the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act .
&quot; Let me say directly to these Americans : you deserve better , &quot; Se@@ be@@ li@@ us said in testim@@ ony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington .

The government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syri@@ an air@@ force base
On Thursday , an American government official , who wished to remain anonymous , made a statement to American news broad@@ cast@@ er CN@@ N , stating that Israeli figh@@ ter planes had attacked an air@@ force base in the Syri@@ an town of Lat@@ akia the day before .
The target was &quot; missi@@ les and related equipment &quot; , which the Israeli government fe@@ ared were intended for the Leban@@ ese He@@ z@@ bollah , according to CN@@ N .
The Syri@@ an and Leban@@ ese media , as well as Arab@@ ic broad@@ cast@@ er Al-@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Lat@@ akia was fi@@ red upon during the night from Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party .
Israeli television broad@@ cast@@ er Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Lat@@ akia , in which Russian S-@@ 125 Ne@@ wa@@ -@@ type defence missi@@ les and a battery of SA@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les could be seen , which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport war@@ heads weigh@@ ing up to 70 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s .
Un@@ sure , the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
However , press agency Re@@ uters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack , but was not sure .
In any case , a spo@@ kes@@ person for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : &quot; We are not comm@@ enting on these reports &quot; .
Journ@@ alist R@@ on Ben@@ -@@ Y@@ is@@ hai , writing for daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ oth A@@ hr@@ on@@ oth , emphasised that the Syri@@ an regime had already previously attempted , in some cases successfully , to deliver ground to air missi@@ les to He@@ z@@ bollah .
The Israeli government had previously repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply He@@ z@@ bollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a &quot; red line &quot; , which would result in a military response .
John Ker@@ ry says US sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately &quot; in unprecedented admission
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the U.@@ S &apos;s defen@@ sive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
The Secretary of State also admitted that he &apos;d been guilty , along with Barack Obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as incen@@ di@@ ary re@@ vel@@ ations from whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den about the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying activities emerged .
The le@@ aks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Spe@@ aking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &quot; There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;
He then became the first high-@@ ranking member of the U.@@ S government to admit that US sp@@ ying had cro@@ ssed the line , but emphasised that no one &apos;s rights had been ab@@ used .
He said : &quot; In some cases , it has reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse .
I assure you innocent people are not being ab@@ used in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &quot; We &apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up . &quot;
There is radical extremis@@ m in the world that is h@@ ell@@ -@@ b@@ ent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments .
So what if you were able to inter@@ c@@ ept that and stop it before it happens ?
We have actually prevented air@@ planes from going down , buildings from being blo@@ wn up , and people from being assass@@ inated because we &apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
Meanwhile , U.S. law@@ makers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. sp@@ ying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-@@ terrorism efforts with the U.S. , the chairman of a Sen@@ ate sub@@ committee on European affairs said on Thursday .
Sen@@ ator Chris Mur@@ ph@@ y of Connec@@ tic@@ ut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-@@ terrorist organizations because of fru@@ stration over surveillance by the National Security Agency .
&quot; It &apos;s really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-@@ terrorism ende@@ a@@ vors , &quot; Mur@@ ph@@ y , a first-@@ term Democra@@ t and chairman of the Sen@@ ate Foreign Relations Sub@@ committee on European Affairs , said in an interview from Washington .
And I &apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in comb@@ at@@ ting terrorism , not@@ with@@ standing their anger over these N@@ SA programs .
News reports that the N@@ SA swe@@ pt up millions of phone records in Europe have fra@@ yed relations with some U.S. allies , though the agency &apos;s chief said this week that they were in@@ accurate and reflected a mis@@ understanding of met@@ ad@@ ata that Nat@@ o allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations c@@ ited documents le@@ aked by Snow@@ den that the N@@ SA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
The national intelligence director , James Cla@@ pper , defended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it &apos;s comm@@ on@@ place on both sides .
A@@ mid the u@@ pro@@ ar , Mur@@ ph@@ y said his office is arran@@ ging the con@@ gres@@ sional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
N@@ ames of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days .
He said the itiner@@ ary is still being worked out .
While Mur@@ ph@@ y said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some &quot; tough love &quot; will also be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age programs they &apos;ve used for years themselves .
&quot; While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;re not the only ones that are out there sp@@ ying , &quot; Mur@@ ph@@ y said .
Meanwhile , Mr Ker@@ ry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address ran@@ c@@ or over U.S. strategies in the Syria , Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities .

Australian woman appe@@ als Thai j@@ ail time
A 2@@ 1-@@ year-old Sydney woman sent@@ enced to 15 days j@@ ail in P@@ hu@@ ket for fal@@ sely claiming she was ass@@ aul@@ ted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdi@@ ct and has been granted ba@@ il .
Ste@@ vie Ro@@ ch@@ elle B@@ am@@ ford was initially found guilty by a P@@ hu@@ ket provin@@ cial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver , with two other men restra@@ ining her , carried out the ass@@ ault in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .
However , CC@@ TV foot@@ age later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boy@@ friend .
P@@ hu@@ ket police inter@@ viewed B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabri@@ c@@ ating the story .
She was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
B@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to serve the 15-@@ day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of P@@ hu@@ ket rather than in an adult women &apos;s j@@ ail .
She is the daughter of former Australian le@@ ague player Peter Tun@@ ks , who has appe@@ aled to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Can@@ ber@@ ra to assist his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told Sydney &apos;s Sunday Tele@@ graph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
&quot; It &apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we &apos;re hop@@ e@@ ful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; Tun@@ ks said .
B@@ am@@ ford is appealing the sentence and has been granted ba@@ il of 50@@ ,000 bah@@ t .
Re@@ ports in Australia said that in the meantime , she was holi@@ da@@ ying at the resort area of Kra@@ bi in Southern Thailand .
Th@@ ai@@ -based legal sources said B@@ am@@ ford was being represented by a local lawyer in P@@ hu@@ ket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison .
However , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Mich@@ elle Smith in P@@ hu@@ ket , Thailand may also be looking to repair its bat@@ tered tourist image , leading to an acqu@@ it@@ tal .
A Republi@@ can strategy to counter the re-@@ election of Obama
Republi@@ can leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is r@@ ar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ tn@@ ing .
Indeed , Republi@@ can lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vot@@ er tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republi@@ can representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 b@@ ills restri@@ cting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to register as a vot@@ er on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indi@@ ana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States up@@ held the constitu@@ tionality of the Indi@@ ana law .
The Republi@@ can authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they spon@@ sored b@@ ills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
It is important to note that , unlike Que@@ bec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions dis@@ proportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
And that &apos;s not all .
Stu@@ dents , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republi@@ can , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ pan@@ ic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three His@@ pan@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 2011 Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors spon@@ sored laws aboli@@ shing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without consequence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , vot@@ er registration campaigns contributed to regi@@ stering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic legislat@@ ors and their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restri@@ cting vot@@ er registration .
Several b@@ ills were blocked by v@@ et@@ oes of Democratic govern@@ ors .
The United States Att@@ or@@ ney General interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to partially limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
However , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics den@@ ounce the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
A 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the PS@@ A test sometimes shows er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
En@@ ough to make already reluc@@ tant men hesitate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mor@@ tali@@ ty between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follow-up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer .
Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive can@@ c@@ ers and others that are in@@ dol@@ ent .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating pro@@ state can@@ c@@ ers that are not long-term life threatening , and op@@ ting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease pro@@ gresses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Therefore I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the Soci@@ été internationale d &apos;@@ u@@ ro@@ log@@ ie &#91; SI@@ U &#93; , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and cons of the PS@@ A test .
You can download the document ( in English for the time being , a &#91; French &#93; translation will be available shortly ) at this address : http : / / ca@@ .@@ mo@@ v@@ em@@ ber@@ .com / fr / men@@ s-@@ health / pro@@ state-@@ can@@ cer@@ -@@ screening
Pre@@ vent@@ ing the disease
Unfortunately , there is no mi@@ racle recip@@ e for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living hab@@ its remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exerc@@ ised enough , 30 % of can@@ c@@ ers could be prevented .
&quot; If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , &quot; says Andr@@ é Beau@@ lieu , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Canadian Canc@@ er Society .
On the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of can@@ c@@ ers are her@@ edi@@ tary .
Some are also completely un@@ explained .
For the Canadian Canc@@ er Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ ttes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massi@@ vely damages people &apos;s health .
&quot; Even today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Que@@ bec &quot; deplo@@ res spo@@ kes@@ person Andr@@ é Beau@@ lieu .
En@@ coura@@ ging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drop@@ s by half .
Wei@@ ght
Over@@ weight and obe@@ sity are also con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the SC@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gu@@ s , pan@@ cre@@ as and uter@@ us .
&quot; Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer &quot; it is also said .
D@@ iet
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo@@ -@@ rec@@ tal cancer .
Likewise , so do cu@@ red meat products , and these should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens .
&quot; They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer &quot; it is explained .
Vit@@ am@@ ins
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vit@@ amin supple@@ ments and cancer .
For the time being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive .
Studies on vit@@ amin E are contradi@@ ctory , according to the SC@@ C .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase .
Also the effect of vit@@ amin D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
&quot; Taking a screening test doesn &apos;t give you cancer . &quot;
The Hig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
The announcement of the prob@@ able discovery of the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a sti@@ r last summer , and with good reason .
Indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Uni@@ verse , no less .
Also it is the last partic@@ le whose existence is predic@@ ted by the Standard Model - our best or &quot; less worse &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cally .
But for physi@@ ci@@ sts , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hig@@ gs .
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic partic@@ le , and greatly res@@ embles the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son predic@@ ted by the Standard Model .
In addition , new data un@@ vei@@ led this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
But let &apos;s sup@@ pose that it really is the Hig@@ gs , since the chances of being mist@@ aken seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
In our world , there is a fat@@ ally un@@ avoid@@ able law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
There &apos;s no way to break this rule - and don &apos;t try too hard , you &apos;ll go mad .
However , even though partic@@ le physi@@ cs is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pau@@ li exclusion principle , which states that two partic@@ les cannot occup@@ y the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; qu@@ ant@@ um state &quot; - this &quot; state &quot; consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
Based on this , physi@@ ci@@ sts classi@@ fy partic@@ les into two categories .
In one corner we have good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who wis@@ ely o@@ bey the Pau@@ li principle .
While l@@ ur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a n@@ asty band of an@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Ber@@ kel@@ ey Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and &quot; force partic@@ les &quot; by which the great forces of nature are prop@@ ag@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow related .
These bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exotic bugs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extra@@ ordin@@ arily ban@@ al bo@@ son : the phot@@ on , or the &quot; light partic@@ le &quot; which is the &quot; m@@ essenger &quot; of the electro@@ magnetic force .
When , in fact , a partic@@ le having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this &quot; distur@@ bs &quot; the electro@@ magnetic field in this specific place , rather like a p@@ eb@@ ble thrown in a p@@ ond .
This &quot; distur@@ b@@ ance &quot; produces an electro@@ magnetic wave ( of light , infra@@ red , ultra@@ viol@@ et etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a phot@@ on - and thus one of the &quot; force carrier &quot; bo@@ sons .
More stable field
The same applies to the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which must be &quot; distur@@ bed &quot; for the bo@@ son to appear .
Now , this Hig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen p@@ ond which would need a very large rock to w@@ rin@@ k@@ le the surface .
Which is why a huge partic@@ le acceler@@ ator like the one at C@@ ER@@ N - the Large H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The analo@@ gy with the electro@@ magnetic field is again useful for expla@@ ining the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
In fact not all partic@@ les , or all materials , inter@@ act with the electro@@ magnetic field .
Some , such as magn@@ ets , do so , but others don &apos;t - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fridge .
And likewise , not all partic@@ les inter@@ act with the Hig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the phot@@ on ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research &quot; can bring &quot; ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ on@@ don .
For science , it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model ( SM ) , and also allows physi@@ cians to examine any discre@@ pan@@ cies between the observations and predic@@ tions of the SM .
A number of people , moreover , fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sligh@@ test difference could open a door to a &quot; new physi@@ cs &quot; and plug certain holes in the Model .
This , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gra@@ vity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Uni@@ verse ( re-@@ o@@ ops ! ) .
But to date no such discre@@ pan@@ cies have been found at C@@ ER@@ N .
Re@@ percussions
The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predi@@ ct , but it would be wrong to assume that there won &apos;t be any .
Remember : in the very early 6@@ 0s , the pione@@ ers of the laser at B@@ ell Labor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be trig@@ gered by their work .
They had an in@@ kl@@ ing of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at B@@ ell Lab@@ s , where the laser was invented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous laser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a &quot; la@@ b g@@ ad@@ get . &quot;
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instru@@ mentation that sur@@ rounds research .
For example , the same Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle developed a small light sensor in 1969 , during his work in op@@ tics .
This sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an &quot; eye &quot; to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physi@@ cs prize in 2009 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ HC will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
Pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die ... &#124; Le De@@ voir
With its D@@ ying with D@@ ign@@ ity Commission , Que@@ bec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
However , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
Le De@@ voir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ ré@@ gie apartment .
The fest@@ ering pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two-@@ year re@@ spite .
&quot; They gave me five years to live , I &apos;ve made it to seven , &quot; he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day .
&quot; But it &apos;s still a shock , you can never be prepared for it &quot; he adds .
The disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
Sit@@ ting in front of an ap@@ peti@@ sing lunch , he con@@ s@@ ents to being helped to eat , re@@ signed .
Cou@@ ra@@ geous , he even manages to s@@ mile , talks to the stran@@ gers bu@@ st@@ ling around him , bringing him his medic@@ ation , offering him a bath .
The courage of ordinary death .
&quot; What I want most is to be cu@@ red of my di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea , it &apos;s hum@@ ili@@ ating &quot; he confi@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
&quot; During our lives , we learn that a man pis@@ ses standing up , &quot; says Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , psych@@ ologist at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home .
Re@@ gress@@ ing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable hum@@ ili@@ ation .
&quot; It depends on the person &apos;s ability &quot; to accept the re@@ gression , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such re@@ gression .
Pati@@ ents at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
They have a maximum life expec@@ tan@@ cy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nur@@ ses surrounding them no longer provides so-called &quot; cu@@ rative &quot; care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die &quot; conscious and suff@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
But the disease has made me discover my children .
&quot; I have fine children &quot; she adds .
&quot; I don &apos;t wish for anything more in life &quot; she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her brea@@ the .
She looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
At Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is , a group of volunteers provides bo@@ di@@ ly care and help with feeding .
This is pal@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
To make death more comfortable .
In Que@@ bec , there are pal@@ li@@ ative care beds for 1@@ 1,@@ 700 inhabitants .
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
Here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
Whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brand@@ y or Pep@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ pp@@ le .
Di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the dec@@ e@@ ased .
&quot; We help relatives as much as patients &quot; says N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
At the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
Along with a 9@@ 3-@@ year-old man who is sav@@ ouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly wed@@ ged in his pil@@ lows while to@@ asts are dr@@ un@@ k in his honour , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ young man is dying tra@@ gi@@ cally , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
&quot; For six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old &quot; says a concerned Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
L@@ ack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of Canadi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
And a number of organisations , such as the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Gre@@ ater Montreal , speciali@@ se more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
It is precisely this large gap in Que@@ bec health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physi@@ cians fear the adoption of a law on eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suicide .
Since October , a manifest@@ o , signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care l@@ umin@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bern@@ ard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circul@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
According to Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Que@@ bec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia .
Recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I &apos;m afraid that patients ask to die because they don &apos;t receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some on@@ c@@ ologists work rel@@ ent@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Richard &apos;s survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ o@@ therapy .
When I announced to my on@@ c@@ ologist that I was st@@ opping the treatment , she told me she regret@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
No all-@@ powerful care
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ gi@@ vers for not having acc@@ eded to their request after they have been relie@@ ved of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
According to El@@ sie Mon@@ ere@@ au , Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Gre@@ ater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physi@@ cians then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ adi@@ cally or permanently .
We can no longer pre@@ tend not to understand this part of their suffering .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , an un@@ relie@@ ved patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation .
Pati@@ ents who are not relie@@ ved always say the same thing : &quot; I want to die . &quot;
But this does not necessarily mean &quot; I want you to eu@@ than@@ ise me , &quot; it means &quot; I want to be relie@@ ved . &quot;

Wi@@ des@@ pread real estate scand@@ als in Que@@ bec
Day after day highway officials , building contrac@@ tors , political party fund@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ers and Italian ma@@ fia specialists tell what they know of a form@@ id@@ able &quot; system , &quot; combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade uni@@ on@@ ists and organised crime .
An &quot; industry &quot; which has cost Que@@ bec taxpayers de@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s .
&quot; It is curi@@ ous how the system is cru@@ mb@@ ling since we took dra@@ stic measures &quot; says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au ir@@ on@@ ically , a Que@@ bec politi@@ cian and former Montreal Chief of Police .
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in-depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Que@@ bec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had con@@ s@@ ented only reluc@@ t@@ antly .
The &quot; Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report &quot; established a direct link between industry , under-@@ the-@@ table financing of parties and bri@@ ber@@ y of officials .
&quot; Since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone re@@ porte@@ dly saved a billion dollars on contracts , &quot; with certain people cur@@ bing their inst@@ inc@@ ts to get a share !
The Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission &quot; has already brought down two may@@ ors &quot; he adds , hoping that it will succeed in &quot; reve@@ aling the schemes behind the individuals . &quot;
A permanent anti-@@ corruption unit , created in 2011
The Per@@ man@@ ent Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption Unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government an@@ alyst@@ s , investig@@ ators , and audi@@ tors .
Plus the &quot; Mar@@ teau squ@@ ad &quot; poli@@ c@@ emen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal &quot; se@@ wer car@@ tel &quot; to soft pe@@ dal on the inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of sear@@ ches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ cot@@ te , Mayor of a sub@@ urban town .
Next on the list is apparently Gil@@ les V@@ ail@@ lan@@ court , who has just re@@ signed from his post as Mayor of Lav@@ al , third largest city in Que@@ bec .
He is suspec@@ ted of po@@ ck@@ eting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Acc@@ ur@@ so and Lin@@ o Z@@ ambi@@ to .
The latter caused a sen@@ sation by expla@@ ining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts &quot; system &quot; to the commission .
He himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the ma@@ fia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ ér@@ ald Tre@@ mb@@ lay &apos;s party .
Mr Z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provin@@ cial parties , especially the Liberals then in power .
He also admitted having organised an illegal fund@@ ra@@ iser for former Liberal Dep@@ ut@@ y-@@ Prime Minister , N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au .
Se@@ wer contracts with infl@@ ated costs
In Montreal , the corruption &quot; system &quot; ran smoothly .
Gil@@ les Sur@@ pren@@ ant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , inv@@ it@@ ations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , ho@@ ckey matches and bri@@ bes tot@@ alling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he infl@@ ated the costs .
Other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by infl@@ ating invo@@ ices by 30 to 40 % , and by false ad@@ d-@@ ons .
Then an organis@@ er of the Mayor &apos;s party , Martin D@@ um@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his co@@ ff@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these re@@ vel@@ ations , Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay re@@ signed in early November , pl@@ ung@@ ing Montreal into a major crisis .
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm .
Mayor of the bor@@ ough of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re-@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she prote@@ sted in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resol@@ d for ... 1.@@ 6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she &quot; is following a thread in order to find out how the system - in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ gr@@ ene and catch the cul@@ pri@@ ts . &quot;
The process , she says , is &quot; painful but positive . &quot;
The wo@@ und is being cleaned , but Montreal would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these question@@ able practices .
How to clean house .
Prop@@ erly .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that &quot; officials st@@ ole hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is especially concerned about the role of &quot; elected people aware of the scheme , &quot; when they were not up to their nec@@ ks in the sc@@ am !
E@@ stim@@ ating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Que@@ bec at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : &quot; I was told that it was only a p@@ ale reflection of reality . &quot;
The Que@@ bec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : &quot; Until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
He advocates a complete over@@ hau@@ l of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : &quot; We can &apos;t go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to re@@ build the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . &quot;
Although this story tar@@ nis@@ hes the international image of Que@@ bec and Montreal , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au invites anyone lau@@ gh@@ ing to look in their own back@@ yard ...
&quot; PS@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! &quot;
This season , you have taken on a new stat@@ ure with PS@@ G .
How do you explain this pro@@ gression ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PS@@ G .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I &apos;m making progress alongside them .
The technical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it &apos;s easier .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don &apos;t get worked up .
From my de@@ but at the Cla@@ i@@ ref@@ on@@ taine IN@@ F pre-@@ training centre to my transfer to Saint-@@ E@@ ti@@ enne , I &apos;ve always moved step by step .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti ...
This summer &apos;s recru@@ its are used to playing matches at a high level .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti gives me a lot as regards my position .
He &apos;s supported by de@@ pu@@ ties like Claude Mak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me .
Is An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti the man for the job ?
Defin@@ itely .
An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti inspi@@ res respect among all the experts .
Today he has no equal in Lig@@ ue 1 , and he &apos;s one of the best co@@ aches in Europe .
He has m@@ asses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs .
He &apos;s worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of inj@@ uries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PS@@ G ?
In Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon over@@ took us at the top .
But we &apos;re waiting on the sid@@ el@@ ines .
One of our main goals is the Champ@@ ions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club &apos;s goal in this competition ?
We &apos;ll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we &apos;ll have something to say against some very good European teams .
First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
Can PS@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the budget ...
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
Today , this isn &apos;t the case .
Finan@@ cially , PS@@ G has the means to make it happen .
In Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
Defin@@ itely , it would be a major disappointment .
This year , we &apos;re really committed to winning the champ@@ ionship .
We weren &apos;t far away last season .
In May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
It was a terri@@ fic season .
We finished with 79 points .
Norm@@ ally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mont@@ p@@ elli@@ er , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Mar@@ sei@@ lle , Lyon and Bor@@ deaux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
Do you think the media expect too much of PS@@ G ?
It &apos;s normal for them to expect a lot from us given what &apos;s been invested and the players we have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4-@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that &apos;s definitely a bit fru@@ str@@ ating .
You wonder what more people expect .
You &apos;re never going to win 4-@@ 0 every weekend .
We &apos;re not FC Barcelona !
We &apos;re trying to implement a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Champ@@ ions League proved we could hold our own .
Look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Mar@@ sei@@ lle , who were no good last season , were &quot; boo@@ sted &quot; by the new PS@@ G .
This shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to s@@ mile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
PS@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic .
So much so that people say there is a &quot; Z@@ lat@@ an dependence . &quot;
This means I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
That &apos;s why he came , and he &apos;s pro@@ ving he &apos;s the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
He &apos;s demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Within the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is truly exceptional .
It pus@@ hes others to raise their level of play .
Th@@ i@@ ago Sil@@ va , who is one of the best defen@@ ders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
Today , I &apos;m playing well in selection matches .
Which is what I &apos;ve been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the Blu@@ es .
I &apos;ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour .
What do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ champ@@ s &apos;s first few months in charge of the Blu@@ es ?
He has the results he wanted .
We &apos;re well placed in the World quali@@ fying group .
The coach is tough , close to the players , and inspi@@ res them to win .
Like Lau@@ rent Blan@@ c was .
But I don &apos;t want to make any compar@@ isons .
Blan@@ c had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ champ@@ s will take the Blu@@ es to Brazil .
Did the good draw ( 1-@@ 1 ) s@@ nat@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
That match gave us confidence .
Every@@ body fought for everybody .
Before that shock in Spain , I &apos;d never experienced such a match in my career .
With Bit@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises .
In fact , Bit@@ coin , invented by Sat@@ o@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ am@@ o@@ to ( a p@@ seu@@ don@@ y@@ m ) , is both a virtual currency ( but con@@ verti@@ ble into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like Bit@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er file exchange .
Around 200@@ ,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,000 computers on the network .
Close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
The bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a do@@ zen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .com site ) .
Nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
It describes bit@@ coin as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; in competition with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
Bit@@ coin diff@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as &apos; credits &apos; , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each occasion , a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchanges .
With Bit@@ coin , all no@@ des in the network are both cu@@ sto@@ di@@ ans of the book of accounts , audi@@ tors , currency issu@@ ers , and buyers and s@@ ellers .
How does the network operate ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail .
Exc@@ ept that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anony@@ m@@ ity .
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electron@@ ically by a du@@ al-@@ key encryption system .
So the network can verify the authentic@@ ity of the transaction .
Using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the ex@@ changed bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
It passes through the resolution of a mathemati@@ cal challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central ban@@ ker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
This is a file h@@ ash@@ ing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital im@@ print .
Computers &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a number to it , then &quot; h@@ ash &quot; it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one .
The transaction is then inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print .
If a user wanted to def@@ rau@@ d by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an orph@@ an because the two have different im@@ prints .
The computer that resol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
To avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are divi@@ sible down to the hundred milli@@ on@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in comp@@ uting power .
The life of the network has had its ups and down@@ s .
Websites providing services for Bit@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits st@@ olen .
&quot; The lo@@ op@@ hole used is not the protocol itself &quot; says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at re@@ assur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the Bit@@ coin network .
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money la@@ undering using this anonymous service .
But cash also has this weakness .
Major players like Wiki@@ pedia refuse donations of this nature .
Others , such as the WordPress blog platform , accept them .
Recently , A@@ di Sh@@ am@@ ir and Dor@@ it R@@ on , from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circul@@ ate .
In November , &quot; huge s@@ ell@@ -@@ off@@ s &quot; were launched .
&quot; Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were ex@@ changed &quot; welcomes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system , Pay@@ t@@ unia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a cont@@ ac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses Bit@@ coin to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
Also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
The system is easy to implement by merchan@@ ts , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can &quot; photogra@@ ph and recognise &quot; says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users .
There is a general movement to re@@ app@@ raise hierarch@@ ical systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; It will take time for Bit@@ coin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , &quot; he predic@@ ts .
The ECB , in its report , says it will re@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency &apos;s success .
We got out of Afghanistan .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ is@@ a and Su@@ rob@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ ants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wo@@ unded , the ma@@ im@@ ed .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extrem@@ ists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often pe@@ as@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the Sovi@@ ets .
They want to defend their traditions , both ancient and arch@@ a@@ ic , even though they have been joined by Ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts , Pakist@@ an@@ is , Ara@@ bs , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , Ta@@ ji@@ ks .
Toler@@ ated , sometimes assisted , by local insur@@ g@@ ents , the latter will no longer be so when West@@ ern@@ ers become more scar@@ ce .
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of al@@ mond trees plan@@ ted with French funding , was carried out in an or@@ derly fashion .
Con@@ vo@@ ys of trucks and arm@@ oured vehicles reached Kab@@ ul without being attacked , over@@ flo@@ wn by helicop@@ ters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kab@@ ul by the end of 2014 .
Cir@@ cum@@ stances have changed since their ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble advance between 1994 and 1996 .
At that time Kab@@ ul was empty , the country being tor@@ n apart by the stru@@ gg@@ les between different fac@@ tions .
Their ta@@ ke@@ over of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety .
Afghan@@ is paid the price of the ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ anti@@ sm of these pe@@ as@@ ants by the organisation of Al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da , but their situation has not improved today .
For@@ mer Mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are al@@ lied in the desire to keep women in an in@@ fer@@ ior position .
The main anti-@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
They became profit@@ e@@ ers , sei@@ zing government land to re@@ sell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benef@@ iting from huge American outs@@ ourcing contracts .
They have become dis@@ credited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of th@@ ie@@ ves .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its ide@@ ologies .
They have rub@@ bed shoul@@ ders with the modern world during their ex@@ ile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
Rou@@ ghly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kab@@ ul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ anti@@ sm of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish so@@ ap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
For@@ mer comm@@ anders of the anti-@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provin@@ cial mili@@ ti@@ as , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identi@@ ties , should be able to benefit from a certain decentrali@@ sation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centrali@@ sed State , with strong presidential power , aboli@@ shing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Kar@@ z@@ ai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
But , since the 50@@ s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No industries have been re-@@ established , no dam@@ s are in good condition , no major ir@@ ri@@ gation systems have been repa@@ ired .
Everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
The Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative .
In a country ru@@ ined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth .
This only added to the feeling that the West@@ ern@@ ers were only there to sei@@ ze it .
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archae@@ ologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddh@@ ist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations .
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls &apos; high school , boys &apos; high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the archaeological Delegation .
Since 2009 , to try to &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; and achieve the impossible task of re@@ conc@@ iling aid and offensive actions , a &quot; ci@@ vil@@ -@@ military actions &quot; service from the Ministry of defence ( C@@ im@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NG@@ O , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in doz@@ ens of mountain villages .
These projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insur@@ gency : ir@@ ri@@ gation , well@@ s , drinking water , re@@ fore@@ station , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas .
What will we leave as a sou@@ ven@@ ir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2@@ ,000 metres above sea level .
The Emb@@ assy has received doz@@ ens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ is@@ a province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the u@@ pris@@ ing led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gam@@ ble for President Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si .
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
Taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
For two years Egypt has re@@ lied on a provi@@ sional text , amended several times and this has weak@@ ened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os .
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is per@@ sever@@ ing in his &quot; auto@@ cratic deli@@ ri@@ um , &quot; continuing to &quot; go back on his word &quot; and &apos; tra@@ mp@@ le the law . &quot;
His supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by spee@@ ding up the transition process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Bro@@ thers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
For the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country .
Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote favou@@ ra@@ bly , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
Partic@@ ularly since a ha@@ sty vote sm@@ acks of an ultim@@ atum to the Egyptian people : &quot; Ei@@ ther you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , &quot; these powers supposedly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islam@@ ist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
Most of the liber@@ als were missing .
In mid-@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had sl@@ amm@@ ed the door , feeling they had failed to asser@@ t their views .
Represent@@ atives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise .
In order to obtain a qu@@ or@@ um , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were has@@ ti@@ ly added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
Comm@@ ent@@ ators were also am@@ used that one of the only di@@ versions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of pra@@ yer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
The text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 23@@ 4 articles .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , stipul@@ ating that &quot; the principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law . &quot;
The Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules , &quot; which would have allowed stricter application .
For the Islam@@ ists , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
&quot; Hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y &quot; respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication coup .
Because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
They refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al-@@ Az@@ h@@ ar University an advisory role , with particular reference to veri@@ fying the con@@ formity of the laws with sh@@ aria .
According to Egypt specialist S@@ oph@@ ie P@@ omm@@ ier , this is worrying because &quot; the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
This suggests the beginn@@ ings of a the@@ o@@ cracy . &quot;
The liber@@ als &apos; fears are also fu@@ elled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
&quot; For the time being , there is no concrete religious implic@@ ation .
With this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law schol@@ ars but academ@@ ics , some trained in the French system &quot; quali@@ fies Ale@@ xis Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a the@@ sis on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he acknowled@@ ges that &quot; there may be some ambigu@@ ity regarding article 220 , because the terms used bor@@ row from the religious voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
Re@@ ference is made in particular to &quot; fi@@ q@@ h &quot; &#91; Islamic juris@@ pru@@ dence , Editor &apos;s note &#93; .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pron@@ ounce on it . &quot;
Beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Bro@@ thers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers confer@@ red on the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tri@@ bun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repressive .
The off@@ ence of blas@@ ph@@ em@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohibited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights Heb@@ a Mor@@ a@@ ye@@ f , from Human Rights Watch .
In her opinion , the only positive point is the prohi@@ bition of torture in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Sup@@ por@@ ters of the Head of State will mar@@ ch on Saturday .
In Israel , hol@@ y places await Ukrainian tourists , the omp@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The Holy Land combines the sp@@ l@@ end@@ our of bi@@ b@@ lical tru@@ ths , modern comfort and pri@@ me@@ val nature .
Ai@@ F &#91; Argum@@ ent@@ i i Fak@@ ti &#93; newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let &apos;s wor@@ ship the hol@@ y places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed .
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism &quot; bath &quot; are bl@@ essed by God .
Galile@@ e is the place where Jesus performed his magic : turned water into wine at a wedding , wal@@ ked on water , cal@@ med a storm , and filled the nets .
This is also where Jesus came before his dis@@ ciples and after the res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion .
But the biggest number of hol@@ y places is in Jerusalem .
Be@@ lie@@ vers walk through the Way of Grie@@ f or Via Dol@@ or@@ o@@ sa .
It starts by the Ant@@ onia For@@ tress - Pra@@ et@@ orium - where the jud@@ gement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ tha - the place of the cru@@ ci@@ fix@@ ion , St@@ one of Un@@ ction and the place of Jesus &apos; bu@@ rial .
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian omp@@ hal@@ os , which symboli@@ zes the sal@@ vation of mankind .
The Holy Cross Mon@@ astery in Jerusalem is er@@ ected at the site that , according to Christian legend , yiel@@ ded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus &apos; cru@@ ci@@ fix@@ ion .
Jerusalem has the most hol@@ y places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 AD .
According to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
Travel along a vertical
Ru@@ ins of the Mass@@ ada For@@ tress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
They are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level .
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
Others are delivered to this historical mountain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way .
In the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00-@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which f@@ ills up with tourists in winter months .
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
The total length of ski pist@@ es is 45 km .
According to an ancient legend , p@@ agan go@@ ds used to live on the mountain .
Visit unique museums
This country has about 300 museums .
You won &apos;t be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
Among them - Museum of Israel , located close to Kn@@ es@@ set ( Parliament ) .
It has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ crip@@ ts and De@@ ad Sea sc@@ roll@@ s found in the c@@ aves of the Ju@@ de@@ an desert , along with about 500@@ ,000 archaeological and anth@@ rop@@ ological ar@@ te@@ facts .
The Museum of Art in T@@ el-@@ Avi@@ v is also interesting .
Its exhi@@ bits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ar@@ ro , Reno@@ ir , Sis@@ ley , Ce@@ z@@ anne , M@@ ati@@ sse , Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all , Pic@@ asso .
In Ak@@ ko , you can visit the bath museum Al@@ -B@@ ash@@ a , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath atten@@ dants of the time .
In Ca@@ es@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculp@@ tures of Dal@@ i and Ro@@ din .
There are no tour guides or gift shops .
En@@ try is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
The fifth one is the Holocau@@ st Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in T@@ el-@@ Avi@@ v , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children &apos;s mem@@ orial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cham@@ bers .
You go in and find yourself in complete dark@@ ness .
Stars are g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
Wellness
There are three resort areas in Israel , located on the co@@ asts of the Mediterranean , Red , and De@@ ad Se@@ as .
Each have swimming pools , aqu@@ a parks , dol@@ p@@ hin@@ aria and o@@ ce@@ an@@ aria .
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degrees .
The De@@ ad Sea is even war@@ mer , and people swim in it all year round .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
Its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you af@@ lo@@ at , even if you don &apos;t know how to swim .
The surrounding landscapes are sur@@ real in their beauty .
People come here to under@@ go a course of treatment using salt water - wra@@ ps and medicinal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have der@@ mati@@ tis , all@@ ergies , as@@ th@@ mas , ec@@ z@@ em@@ as , ar@@ thri@@ tis , bron@@ ch@@ iti@@ s , or di@@ abetes , or to return emotional balance .
Touch the myst@@ eries of anti@@ qu@@ ity
They are preserved in the old section of T@@ el-@@ Avi@@ v - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
The famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , An@@ ato@@ lia , and Mes@@ o@@ pot@@ am@@ ia runs through it .
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legen@@ ds .
According to legen@@ ds , this is where No@@ ah built his ark and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beauty Andro@@ me@@ da , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
Tou@@ rists really like to wan@@ der the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ ac .
They say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortun@@ e will come to you .
In J@@ aff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
And in Ca@@ es@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , &quot; capture &quot; the Crus@@ ader fortress .
During the Roman period , Ca@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the residence of Roman pre@@ f@@ ects , including Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate .
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances .
A note for the tourist
When you go to Israel , don &apos;t worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country &apos;s population speaks Russian .
For the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily ex@@ changed for sh@@ ek@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.@@ 8 sh@@ ek@@ els ) .
City transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram , and Ha@@ i@@ fa has the only subway line in the country , comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
In essence , it is an underground cable railway .
A ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 sh@@ ek@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
According to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ bath is celebrated in Israel .
Between Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working .
The work week starts on Sunday morning .
Many cafes , restaurants and hotels have only ko@@ sher food , with no por@@ k , seaf@@ ood , fish with no sc@@ ales , or dishes that combine milk with meat .
There is a wide selection of dishes from lam@@ b and beef , sou@@ ps and des@@ ser@@ ts co@@ oked using co@@ con@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ mus pa@@ ste , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ af@@ el ( balls made of ground chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as ) , fruits and vegetables .
The streets of Israel don &apos;t have hom@@ eless dogs .
But there are many well-@@ fed c@@ ats , which walk around la@@ zi@@ ly .
In the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on ro@@ o@@ fs of par@@ ked cars .
These pus@@ sy@@ c@@ ats like busy places and do not refuse tre@@ ats .
Car rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i G@@ etz ) to 18@@ 8 ( Au@@ di A@@ 6 , Vol@@ vo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
Plus insurance of 15 dollars a day .
Bike rental costs 15 sh@@ ek@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 sh@@ ek@@ els on average .
In numbers
In 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
Visi@@ tors and holi@@ day@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
Between January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 .
Only the &quot; high and mi@@ ghty &quot; make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language
While de@@ pu@@ ties and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has sc@@ am artists who sell fa@@ ke certificates .
Every year , 13 million m@@ igrant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
Mo@@ stly these are citizens of Central Asia : U@@ z@@ bekistan , Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan and Turk@@ men@@ istan .
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which obli@@ ges every m@@ igrant worker to pass a Russian language test .
For the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
But with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-@@ residents .
In addition to language , Russian history and basi@@ cs of the legal system will be tested .
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
People who received education certificates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the US@@ S@@ R in 1991 are also exemp@@ t under the law .
Pur@@ pose , do@@ om@@ ed fate , and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Language , Pe@@ op@@ les &apos; Fri@@ end@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
M@@ igrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been opened .
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State D@@ uma members and the Federal Migration Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-@@ residents ?
First of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour sla@@ very .
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Vi@@ ktor Seb@@ ele@@ v .
Rights protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
M@@ igrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems .
If a m@@ igrant does not understand the language , says Seb@@ ele@@ v with certainty , he is do@@ om@@ ed to come across un@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous people , who , pre@@ ten@@ ding to help , will force upon him a &quot; ticket &quot; to terrible , cra@@ mp@@ ed bar@@ ra@@ cks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12-@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many complaints from our migrants .
&quot; They are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their pas@@ sports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , &quot; confirms the Head of the Main M@@ igrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
Not be an@@ gr@@ y , bo@@ ss !
Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
Naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Tur@@ ks , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , and Ta@@ ji@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
Their families don &apos;t even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
After reaching ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
&quot; You feel hum@@ ili@@ ated and in@@ fer@@ ior . &quot;
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
Test@@ ing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the meantime , most of the m@@ igrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
&quot; Welcome , or No Un@@ authorized En@@ try &quot;
Many of the foreigners asser@@ t that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , leg@@ alization costs money : from 12@@ ,000 to 16@@ ,000 rub@@ les .
W@@ here@@ as a fa@@ ke registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
Offic@@ ers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fa@@ ke papers , without registration , hence the ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; They ask for a hundred or two for cigare@@ ttes , tea , &quot; Um@@ ed Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov , a citizen of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan , shared with journalists .
&quot; Rol@@ l up , don &apos;t be cheap , get your art@@ work &quot;
On the first day of the law &apos;s entry into effect it turned out that not only m@@ igrant registration documents can be fa@@ ke .
A few for@@ ged certificates about passing language tests have been sei@@ zed by Federal Migration Services officers already .
For@@ ged documents are printed on a standard colour printer .
Naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rub@@ les for them .
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise m@@ igrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
In addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Inter@@ ior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Inter@@ ior is proposing to tou@@ gh@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : CL@@ IC@@ K shots at wed@@ dings , where there were no cas@@ u@@ alties , and the mass@@ acre st@@ aged by Moscow lawyer D@@ mit@@ ry Vin@@ ogra@@ do@@ v , resulting in CL@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Po@@ lic@@ emen want to prohi@@ bit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
The idea was supported by the head of the D@@ uma Committee on Safety and Anti-@@ Cor@@ ruption , I@@ rin@@ a Y@@ aro@@ va@@ ya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State D@@ uma in the near future .
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by &quot; tigh@@ tening the scre@@ ws . &quot;
An open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social ri@@ f@@ le organizations - demand to abandon the &quot; sen@@ sel@@ ess tou@@ gh@@ ening . &quot;
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ ly Les@@ ni@@ kov to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior &apos;s statistics , 142 crimes using fire@@ arms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tou@@ gh@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the &quot; black &quot; market .
According to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
Nonetheless , the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
Supp@@ liers : from plants to officers
The &quot; black &quot; market of weapons is re@@ plen@@ ished through several channels .
There are five such channels , explains reti@@ red colon@@ el Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years .
Screen@@ shot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
First : &quot; army or military loo@@ t , &quot; i.e. weapons that were st@@ olen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
&quot; We@@ ap@@ ons were st@@ olen by Russian officers and by the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans , &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
Next are &quot; black weapons , &quot; st@@ olen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police ware@@ houses and those st@@ olen directly from law enforcement agencies &apos; employees .
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military ware@@ houses .
Explo@@ sions have often been heard at military ware@@ houses .
&quot; There are proven the@@ ories that some of the fires were inten@@ tional , in order to cover the shortage , &quot; says the former military man .
Manufac@@ tur@@ ers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
&quot; There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not end@@ ure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , &quot; says the expert .
Another source of the &quot; black &quot; market is trafficking .
An especially high number of g@@ uns and machine g@@ uns come from poor countries like Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
&quot; There &apos;s production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a ma@@ fia has formed , which has organized a stream , &quot; explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Exper@@ ts counted the approxim@@ ate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the &quot; black &quot; market .
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analy@@ sis and Public Management Plan@@ ning in 2011 .
Exper@@ ts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Inter@@ ior and Ros@@ stat , crimin@@ ology literature and open data from port@@ als on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
Hal@@ f of all arms on the black market are there &quot; because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , &quot; states the report .
According to researchers &apos; data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is the@@ ft during production , 5 % is &quot; black archae@@ ology . &quot;
A sales consul@@ tant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by &quot; black &quot; dig@@ gers are not being bought any more , because they &apos;re too old .
According to him , dealers go to the military ware@@ house for a new bat@@ ch of goods .
One piece , for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a warrant officer .
It is issued to him , and given through the f@@ ence .
&quot; He takes it to the city and s@@ ells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , &quot; he says .
&quot; The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodi@@ cally , when the crime detection rate is low , it conduc@@ ts test purchases from illegal weapons merchan@@ ts , &quot; says the consul@@ tant .
&quot; Like in a luxury store &quot;
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blo@@ gs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Be@@ go@@ va@@ ya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the &quot; corner &quot; so we can negotiate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comm@@ ent@@ ator Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
To get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consul@@ tant . - I have an acqu@@ ain@@ tance , but I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s reliable .
There are sal@@ es@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to &quot; come &quot; there condi@@ tionally &quot; from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a to@@ oth . &quot;
Right now , even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ du@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won &apos;t give him away .
Beg@@ inners look for weapons in different ways .
For@@ mer military man Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1990 &apos;s , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
The formul@@ as are still the same , according to him .
He was given an album of pictures with &quot; anything and everything . &quot;
&quot; I felt like I was in a luxury store , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
According to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a pi@@ g in a po@@ ke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
&quot; I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate , &quot; describes the expert .
Store on a sofa
Internet sear@@ ches lead to sites and &quot; V@@ konta@@ kte &quot; groups , where weapons &quot; for different purposes &quot; are on offer .
No documents or personal meetings are needed .
&quot; It &apos;s enough to have a certain sum of money , &quot; says the adverti@@ sement heading on the website &quot; Bu@@ y a pist@@ ol or ri@@ f@@ le . &quot;
Users leave their requests and ask questions .
Can a minor buy ?
&quot; Without a license , of course , &quot; asks user &quot; John &quot; ( name is changed ) .
&quot; Want to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , &quot; conc@@ isely requests &quot; F@@ ed@@ or@@ en@@ kov . &quot;
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
People come like hung@@ ry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Si@@ ber@@ ia .

I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of applic@@ ability of the laws of Russia .
People accept orders .
The buyer pays at an AT@@ M .
&quot; In response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , &quot; says Press Secretary of the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons non-governmental organization D@@ mit@@ ry Kis@@ lov .
Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to j@@ ail .
The Federal Security Service now sp@@ reads a big network of fa@@ ke sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
&quot; People are like hung@@ ry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Si@@ ber@@ ia mining coal , &quot; - he says .
Mak@@ aro@@ v for 100 dollars
When buying illegal fire@@ arms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
According to D@@ mit@@ ry Kis@@ lov from the Rights to We@@ ap@@ ons organization , a Mak@@ aro@@ v gun can be acquired for 10@@ 0-@@ 300 dollars .
The wait time is a month to a month and a half .
It is shipped from long-term storage ware@@ houses by the mid-@@ level management of these ware@@ houses .
According to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to Janu@@ ar@@ y-@@ October 2011 , amoun@@ ting to 2@@ 2,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of the@@ ft and ex@@ tor@@ tion of weapons , amm@@ uni@@ tion , explo@@ sive substances and explo@@ sive devices dropped by 7.@@ 8 % .

In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.@@ S.A. against low salaries in super@@ markets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like Mc@@ Donald &apos;s , Bur@@ ger King , T@@ aco B@@ ell , W@@ end@@ y &apos;s and K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky Fri@@ ed Chi@@ cken .
Right now , nobody is able to predi@@ ct whether this wave will turn into the n@@ in@@ th wave or it is dest@@ ined to fi@@ zzle out early .
Ac@@ tions are being supported by unions and a series of left-@@ wing organizations .
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food chains , the goal of the prote@@ sters is to create unions within them .
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 c@@ ents a year ?
Ac@@ tions began last week after Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clas@@ hes .
On this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t cor@@ poration , which emplo@@ ys 2.2 million people around the world , left their work@@ places and pi@@ ck@@ eted together with the unions and left-@@ wing activists from the cor@@ poration stores that sell products to people on low-@@ to-@@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ mar@@ t s@@ ells everything imagin@@ able , from di@@ apers , hunting ri@@ f@@ les and car batteries , to vacuum clean@@ ers , eggs and milk .
Products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major super@@ markets .
So many low-@@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees shop only at their workplace .
Avail@@ ability and assor@@ tment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corporations .
According to critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products che@@ ap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employees .
These latter also compla@@ in about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand-@@ held scann@@ ers .
Prote@@ sters on Black Friday demanded a sal@@ ary increase and compla@@ ined that the cost of medical insurance provided by the cor@@ poration went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employee , receiving 9.@@ 5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Scienti@@ sts from the Ber@@ kel@@ ey University in California argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average sal@@ ary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the cor@@ poration 3.2 billion dollars .
This is about 1.1 % more than it sp@@ ends on salaries right now .
If Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shi@@ fts the cost of increasing wages to the shoul@@ ders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 c@@ ents more .
In one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters happ@@ ily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the cor@@ poration .
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till mid@@ night the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5000 products a second .
In total , its cash regi@@ sters conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
Representative of the cor@@ poration , D@@ an Fo@@ gel@@ man , asser@@ ted in an interview with a left-@@ wing site , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , that a total of &quot; less than five &quot; Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just &quot; another PR tri@@ ck &quot; of the union that organized it .
&quot; Free cash register ! &quot;
Prote@@ sts continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t ( they &apos;re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don &apos;t exist here yet ) , but Mc@@ Donald &apos;s and other cheap restaurants .
Mc@@ Donald &apos;s says that it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ ams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum sal@@ ary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
N@@ obo@@ dy ear@@ ns less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teen@@ agers went through Mc@@ Donald &apos;s , working part-@@ time after school , living with parents .
Fe@@ w saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I continuously come across interviews with Mc@@ Donald &apos;s employees , who compla@@ in that they have to survive on this sal@@ ary and sometimes even feed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
Particip@@ ants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ Donald &apos;s on 40@@ th street and Ma@@ dis@@ on Avenue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and coo@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohi@@ bits the administration from preventing this or pun@@ ishing activists of the union movement by n@@ ag@@ ging or fir@@ ing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
Dis@@ agre@@ eing
No@@ is@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ Donald &apos;s by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . One of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ ams , said : &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s claims it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! &quot;
Demon@@ str@@ ators were supported by other prominent N@@ Y demo@@ crats , like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city may@@ or , who said : &quot; We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic well@@ being , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . &quot;
According to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comp@@ rise tens of thousands of people in New York .
It is unclear right now whether this will spar@@ k a mass movement .
&quot; At the moment , the mind cannot be dec@@ eived too well &quot;
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is au@@ g@@ mented reality , lat@@ ely seen primarily through the pr@@ ism of special gl@@ asses .
At first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too .
However , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Sha@@ h@@ ra@@ m Iz@@ adi , gl@@ asses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of manipul@@ ating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Please tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
While people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing f@@ ing@@ ers at them .
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and predi@@ ct car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction .
For example , X@@ box and Kin@@ ect sensors are a step forward . Almost no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gest@@ ures .
- What else awaits us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ect shi@@ fted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
Information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
We are trying to change this , working on truly three-@@ dimensional display systems based on various technologies , including projec@@ tion technologies .
We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
But for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
Above all , get rid of these stup@@ id virtual reality hel@@ m@@ ets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It &apos;s a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re-@@ for@@ -@@ all - there &apos;s a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
In reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own nich@@ e .
For example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
Mo@@ vements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bra@@ cel@@ et that determined the movement of b@@ ones and mus@@ cles .
It &apos;s big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say .
- O@@ h , that will be very hard to detect .
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual approxim@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person &apos;s reaction .
This could be , e.g. laser sensors . They have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ect sensors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-@@ dimensional recognition .
Of course , it would be good to have eight me@@ ga pixels with 1000 k / s speed .
It &apos;s not just the me@@ ga pixels , though , but the quality of the mat@@ rix and the depth .
From the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorith@@ m designers .
So it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z axis .
Speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gest@@ ures .
Ste@@ ven Ba@@ th@@ iche from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 6@@ 0-@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require tou@@ ching and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infra@@ red emit@@ ter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range .
It is not applied to determine the object &apos;s depth .
Pot@@ enti@@ ally , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
Or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
It would be nice to create a flexible an@@ alogue Kin@@ ect , play with the fle@@ xion of camera dis@@ position and see how this will help in three-@@ dimensional determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its gl@@ asses to the public , unlike Google .
Don &apos;t you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of au@@ g@@ mented reality technologies ?
- Certainly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be &quot; transitional &quot; au@@ g@@ mented reality , where you could shift from gl@@ asses to smart phone , projec@@ tion display , and everywhere else based on a clou@@ d platform .
Gl@@ asses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - au@@ g@@ mented reality based on gl@@ asses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual h@@ olo@@ graphic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from Iron@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no t@@ acti@@ le feedback !
Hand@@ s feel nothing !
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lec@@ tures I often say that au@@ g@@ mented reality is the sevent@@ h consec@@ utive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eigh@@ th will probably be the addition of t@@ acti@@ le sens@@ ations .
For now , one of the interesting tri@@ cks is to use the second hand as a sort of mat@@ rix for the image .
It is great at regi@@ stering pus@@ hes !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these &quot; images in the air &quot; a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultra@@ sound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sen@@ sation , but very weak right now , as if someone ble@@ w on your finger@@ tip .
There are also w@@ r@@ ist bra@@ cel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in f@@ ing@@ ers , which is also a promising area .
- Have you tried to dec@@ eive the mind ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we haven &apos;t tried this yet .
It conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physi@@ cally in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant bal@@ lo@@ ons .
So far dec@@ ei@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there &apos;s work for many years to come .
That &apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginn@@ ings .
Ju@@ d@@ gement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t.@@ ru
Ros@@ b@@ alt continues the project St. Petersburg Av@@ ant-@@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the av@@ ant-@@ garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing f@@ ame in Russia .
The new player in Ros@@ b@@ alt - the bold artist Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler .
The whole city knows Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler , a bear@@ ded man dres@@ sed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Summer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler &apos;s work always brings in crow@@ ds of people , no matter where they are exhi@@ bited .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophi@@ cal stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers and cre@@ ators of new myth@@ ology .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg av@@ ant-@@ garde of the late 80 &apos;s early 90 &apos;s .
Moreover , he is a city man , who makes people s@@ mile on the street and lifts up everyone &apos;s spirit .
Recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg &apos;s music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Boh@@ em@@ ian existence , philosophy and image .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a compromise between artist , ima@@ ge-@@ maker and society .
Although in society , everything that is not grey causes ag@@ gression and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my pro@@ voc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
The whole history of my pro@@ voc@@ ative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you realise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
It became clear to me that this is my path .
Then , the wave of older free , un@@ official artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post-@@ Gaz@@ a-@@ Nev@@ sky style artists ( &quot; post-@@ gaz@@ on@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina &quot; ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I &apos;m drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all gen@@ res except for literature .
- And all this has been united in your Ar@@ t-@@ clin@@ ic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a-@@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Boh@@ em@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Boh@@ em@@ ia .
Many were born there : NO@@ My , Te@@ qu@@ ila Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ nur was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh &apos;s E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ nur and his friends li@@ p s@@ ang easy songs , wearing tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now trendy composer I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ vin was with them .
When the group began to play live , it became Len@@ ingrad .
Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the present@@ er of many programs before H@@ ali@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us .
Gallery D 137 , Gri@@ bo@@ ye@@ do@@ v club - all these echo the Ar@@ t-@@ clin@@ ic .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a her@@ o of the last century , when culture meant something .
In 2000 , there was a pol@@ l in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nominated Arti@@ st of the Year , my cli@@ max came to an end .
In the new times , it is un@@ comfortable to work by old rules . I &apos;m a man of truth , honest@@ y and culture of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a recogn@@ iz@@ able style .
- Many of my works are h@@ its , with clearly reflected relevance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhi@@ bit , &quot; Russian museum in c@@ low@@ ns . &quot;
C@@ low@@ ns are a tim@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and sc@@ ary to be like that .
But everything is bl@@ urred in c@@ low@@ ns , tragedy is removed .
I like gro@@ tes@@ que , I have gro@@ tes@@ que ideas .
For example , saving the world by totalit@@ arian changing of clothes by order .
Nowadays , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
Who knows , maybe you cannot sha@@ ke his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Recently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
Who fits the role better than I ?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- Nowadays , commercial art should be ne@@ at , consider@@ ate , sweet .
There is a dis@@ integration of cultures .
People used to get together in flo@@ cks , Boh@@ em@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , everybody is divided into mic@@ ro societies , it &apos;s hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
Now you have to think who you will please .
Now , each cul@@ t her@@ o has 100 fans .
- But several thousand come to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ i@@ lov !
- The cast@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the sexu@@ al-@@ social sphere is at work there .
But 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . In the end , there &apos;s less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have earned .
In my youth , I painted such art that one collec@@ tor had it han@@ ging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
Conc@@ ep@@ ts are often mixed up these days .
People say : spiritual culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it &apos;s &quot; from another opera . &quot;
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting .
This is the culture I &apos;m for .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But not everyone can be engaged in culture .
Under the right rul@@ ers everything was different . K@@ ings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
There are good consultants in Moscow right now .
Here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
Ju@@ d@@ gement calls are what thri@@ ve now .
Even Er@@ art , but they &apos;re different because they say honest@@ ly that we don &apos;t accept all modern art . There are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there .
It &apos;s hard for art to grow on our rocks .
We need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . This is wrong .
In Europe , there are many curi@@ ous people , who go to art exhi@@ bits , concerts .
Here , this layer is thin .
We need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .
Gi@@ ve birth in space
The earth is in danger .
Global warming or an encounter with a kil@@ ler ast@@ ero@@ id .
Car@@ av@@ ans of co@@ sm@@ ic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
To save humanity , the question is how to prop@@ ag@@ ate our race in conditions of wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
There are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explo@@ red even hy@@ pothe@@ tically .
&quot; Ven@@ us and Mars , &quot; says Senior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P.@@ K. Sh@@ tern@@ berg State Astronom@@ y Institute ( GA@@ IS@@ h ) V@@ ladimir Sur@@ din .
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Ven@@ us has 500@@ -@@ degree temperatures .
Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the or@@ bit of Ven@@ us ... in space .
The question of reproduction in space began with flora .
Hal@@ f a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
Four generations of pe@@ as grown in or@@ bit were no different from their earth counter@@ parts .
Then , in@@ sec@@ ts were b@@ red in or@@ bit , small fruit f@@ lies .
In 1979 , qu@@ ail eggs were sent to space , to check how an em@@ br@@ yo develops in wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
We get an absolutely normal ch@@ ick .
But then the problem begins .
&quot; The problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , &quot; explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological Problems ( IM@@ B@@ P ) RA@@ N V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
Having found no support , chi@@ cks were t@@ umb@@ ling around in dis@@ order .
After 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete at@@ roph@@ y of inst@@ inc@@ ts .
Chi@@ cks did not react to light and sound .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days .
&quot; We b@@ red chi@@ cks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , &quot; says V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v , confir@@ ming the failure of the experiment with chi@@ cks in space .
The last biological &quot; mini-@@ ark &quot; with animals fle@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago .
In spring 2013 , experiments will continue .
However , only sam@@ e-@@ sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bi@@ o-@@ satellite .
There was an experiment with rats , who were sent to space with fo@@ etus .
In principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
&quot; This was on bi@@ o-@@ satelli@@ tes , but again , it was a sing@@ ular experiment and such research needs to be conducted , &quot; says V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
After landing , the co@@ sm@@ ic rats had bab@@ ies .
But it &apos;s hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
It &apos;s not an easy task .
Anim@@ als simply cannot follow their sexual inst@@ inc@@ t , when they &apos;re out of their familiar environment .
In principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens have abstra@@ ct thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
But women have been flying to space for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va .
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body .
Our &quot; Se@@ ag@@ ull &quot; left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
&quot; N@@ obo@@ dy answered this question , &quot; says ro@@ cket and space industry veter@@ an , V@@ ak@@ ht@@ ang V@@ ach@@ n@@ ad@@ ze .
In June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Val@@ ent@@ ina Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va gave birth to a daughter .
The child &apos;s father , An@@ dri@@ an Nikol@@ ae@@ v , was also a cos@@ mon@@ aut .
In 1988 , the second woman cos@@ mon@@ aut , Sv@@ et@@ lana Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ aya , who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk remains .
We have few , very few cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
&quot; What &apos;s more , it is dangerous even for or@@ b@@ ital flights , &quot; adds pilot and cos@@ mon@@ aut , Her@@ o of the US@@ S@@ R , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov .
And yet , humanity needs to seek out some new aven@@ ues in bio@@ technologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gra@@ vity .
Hydro@@ -@@ laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
Here , cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zer@@ o-@@ gra@@ vity conditions .
Water im@@ it@@ ates wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
If for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for in@@ fan@@ ts it is a native element .
Small amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
There is a connection with the fact that an inf@@ ant sp@@ ends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
In principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing .
&quot; This is very little time to forget something , &quot; says inf@@ ant swimming instruc@@ tor Marina Ak@@ sen@@ ova .
In other words , if for a new@@ born wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness is more natural , a woman needs gra@@ vity , earth &apos;s pull .
St@@ om@@ ach and pel@@ vic mus@@ cles usually quickly de@@ generate in wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness ; the ability to push out the em@@ br@@ yo is reduced .
Well , let &apos;s assume that child@@ birth stimul@@ ators will work out .
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
&quot; Then what ? &quot; - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non-@@ tri@@ vi@@ al issue .
On the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gra@@ vity .
When a body does not feel the earth &apos;s pull , it does not form the sk@@ el@@ etal and mus@@ cular system .
It is not possible to dress a new@@ born in or@@ bit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
He will simply not have what he needs to survive .
&quot; And this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handic@@ apped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , &quot; predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ B@@ P RA@@ N I@@ g@@ or P@@ est@@ ov .
For the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
However , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their off@@ spring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
This was said by Mi@@ los@@ la@@ v Kal@@ a , vic@@ e-@@ president of the Supreme Audi@@ t Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Aktu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ cz .
&quot; The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , &quot; states Kal@@ a , comm@@ enting on the current situation .
Simil@@ ar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German audi@@ tors .
As an example of impro@@ per practice , they c@@ ite Pet@@ r N@@ ec@@ as &apos;s approach to the so-called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System . &quot;
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
&quot; The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is dut@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforce , &quot; asser@@ ts Kal@@ a .
At the audit committee &apos;s session in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about parallel audi@@ ting , which we began around two years ago .
Simply put , this is about how European legislation govern@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legisl@@ ations and then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even &quot; more conc@@ ise and complete , &quot; however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
This confirms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to cur@@ ta@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
Economy means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profit@@ e@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
However , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be proc@@ ured .
The system might become over@@ loaded with the amount of pap@@ er@@ work , and those , who wish to look for lo@@ op@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
How does the audit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised differently ?
As far as the office is concerned , the Bundes@@ rechn@@ ung@@ shof functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate simil@@ arly .
Po@@ wers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of audi@@ tors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly diff@@ ers from our own .
The BR@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , for us , are administ@@ ered by regional and municipal authorities , are audi@@ ted by the federal courts of audi@@ tors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ?
Overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such compar@@ isons .
It should be said that even in a country we perc@@ eive as exemplary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
Com@@ ing back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifest@@ ed itself in our audit work yet .
Since we carry out our audi@@ ts ex-@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audi@@ ts - we have launched our new &quot; fiscal failure risk detection &quot; system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes &quot; too constra@@ ined &quot; and will not be enfor@@ ce@@ able .
Under the previous rules , parties being audi@@ ted were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
Is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a techn@@ ic@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let &apos;s see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business@@ men with audi@@ ts of the so-called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System &quot; - what does this mean ?
Is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is dut@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforce .
He may say : &quot; Let us change this law and relax it , &quot; but he cannot say we should pre@@ tend it is not there .
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formali@@ ties which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protected .
On the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ d@@ der with the best offer is excluded on a techn@@ ic@@ ality .
The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
Ro@@ ads are ic@@ y in places , but mostly pass@@ able .
In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are ic@@ y and snow@@ y .
However , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in places .
Carl@@ s@@ bad region
In the Carl@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were ic@@ y and snow@@ y .
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
S@@ no@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the low@@ lands .
However , the ri@@ dges of the K@@ rus@@ ne Mountains have around 30 cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
In some locations there is limited visibility due to m@@ ist , according to the local highway service .
The R@@ 6 high-speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction .
Cau@@ tion is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be ic@@ y and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
All secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads .
In certain stret@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted snow pat@@ ches .
Above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ alo@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern Boh@@ em@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher al@@ ti@@ tudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of comp@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Motor@@ way Direc@@ torate .
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher al@@ ti@@ tudes of the Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce region in particular .
Black ice may occur around Lan@@ sk@@ rou@@ n , U@@ sti n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ i , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ avy , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads .
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ avy .
S@@ now is particularly affecting the roads in the Kr@@ kon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke mountains .
At higher al@@ ti@@ tudes , there is a comp@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ chno@@ v n@@ ad K@@ ne@@ z@@ no@@ u and Tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
In Eastern Boh@@ em@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
Temperat@@ ures will be between min@@ us three and plus one degree Cel@@ sius mostly , with a light wind .
Pil@@ sen region
The roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . Dri@@ vers should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be ic@@ y .
Dri@@ vers should expect m@@ ist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
This information was reported by the region &apos;s highway service .
The D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilomet@@ re marks .
Most primary road surfaces are dry and fro@@ st-@@ free .
Southern areas of the Pil@@ sen and T@@ ach@@ ov regions may have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
Sec@@ on@@ dary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are wet , and may therefore also have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
Dri@@ vers should be cau@@ tious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Boh@@ em@@ ian Forest .
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
Dri@@ vers should expect snow s@@ lush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region .
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se se@@ d@@ lo and on the way to Vi@@ del@@ sky Kri@@ z .
Snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ ghs were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
In other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions .
&quot; In the Sum@@ per@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest al@@ ti@@ tudes .
Dri@@ vers should expect snow s@@ lush at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ s@@ ke se@@ d@@ lo in the direction of Jes@@ en@@ ik , &quot; the dispat@@ ch officer for the Sum@@ per@@ k highway service told CT@@ K today .
Their Jes@@ en@@ ik counter@@ parts also made an ou@@ ting overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest al@@ ti@@ tudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
The Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region &apos;s roads are usable without restriction , while in the area of Stern@@ ber@@ k drivers should be@@ ware in woo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region , Liber@@ ec region
Since this morning , the snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ ghs have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Boh@@ em@@ ia .
Besides certain sno@@ w-@@ covered places , or some ic@@ y fro@@ st pat@@ ches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ ini@@ ce in the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database .
Temperat@@ ures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and ic@@ y . In the low@@ lands , however , particularly sou@@ theast of the Central Boh@@ em@@ ian U@@ pl@@ ands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
No traffic hol@@ d-@@ ups have so far been reported .
I@@ cy fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti .
According to me@@ te@@ or@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and mel@@ ting snow during the day , with a clear night and free@@ zing temperatures .
Ad@@ verse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m and Liber@@ ec regions .
The closure of the Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ ini@@ ce road was caused by b@@ ent tree branches , which were weigh@@ ed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Or@@ n@@ est : At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another star@@ t@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
Together with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , we tend to jo@@ ke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world completely .
In December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
Can you give our readers some details on this ?
This is a nation@@ wide fund@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m .
On the eve , the 20th of December , at 9@@ pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va .
They will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
Who came up with this idea ?
Initi@@ ally it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za Augu@@ sta .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t-@@ shi@@ rts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.@@ e-@@ ta@@ p.@@ cz to support our cause .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , together with other artists , also recorded the so-called an@@ them against the end of the world , called &quot; The End of the World is cancelled . &quot;
It is already well received on YouTube , will it figure at the fund@@ -@@ raising concerts ?
Of course , for the grand fin@@ ale , as long as the world does not end be@@ fore@@ hand .
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time .
The an@@ them will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Tele@@ vision .
The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video cli@@ p was played by T@@ omas Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them ?
We collabor@@ ate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund@@ -@@ raising events and concerts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proce@@ eds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
Equi@@ pping the whe@@ el@@ chair@@ -@@ accessible educational Stu@@ de@@ o centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Ta@@ p from the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the disabled .
Tut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute &apos;s students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tut@@ ors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
Within the construction project at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to comp@@ ile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
For example , in Prague , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Support Les@@ bi@@ ens , Illu@@ str@@ ato@@ sphere with D@@ an Bar@@ ta , The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p , M@@ arian Ban@@ go and J@@ ir@@ i Such@@ y will appear .
Further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .@@ cz .
Are you planning any more &quot; bom@@ bas@@ tic events &quot; in the future ?
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line-@@ up with some interesting guests .
Next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appe@@ ar@@ ances in Washington and Chicago .
Your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band composed of handic@@ apped people .
How do you cope with these jour@@ neys in terms of logistics and organisation ?
It is not as sc@@ ary as it might seem at first .
We have five members in electric whe@@ el@@ chairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ...
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , CS@@ A and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
Thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
What have been your experiences so far ?
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginn@@ ings .
Comp@@ ared to Prague , Moscow is rather in@@ accessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric whe@@ el@@ chair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
Ob@@ vious things , such as giving whe@@ el@@ chairs priority in lifts , are not comm@@ on@@ place there .
Fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
And on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ?
There are a lot of things , which we still lag behind on ...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious han@@ di@@ cap@@ s to be independently out in public , and they can use the toi@@ lets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahead !
Public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athle@@ tes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only exceptional cases , people who are stron@@ g-@@ will@@ ed .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what promp@@ ted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a tut@@ or at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Since I am a musi@@ cian myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ oph@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
With time , as our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ o@@ vic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( lau@@ gh ) .
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mist@@ aken ?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sing@@ ers and also by our pro@@ active work on promoting the band .
We realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed .
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tut@@ ors , equipment and so on .
Was it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such hei@@ ghts ?
From the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
Show business is filled with things , where one im@@ it@@ ates the other .
It is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesit@@ antly and take a long time .
Th@@ ings , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those things .
A person &apos;s first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
But that pity is simply wa@@ sted , because handic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pi@@ tied .
They are people , who can fully live life and b@@ los@@ som , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handic@@ ap succ@@ ee@@ ds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are sugge@@ sting ?
If we want to achieve top class work , we must be un@@ com@@ promising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clou@@ ds , and when they find out they have to go to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly dis@@ appears .
That is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twenty members .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
Only one , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ o@@ vic .
We are an open group , people come and people go , this is un@@ avoid@@ able .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ pm .
The venues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ ch@@ eb@@ a , Br@@ no Fle@@ da , and O@@ stra@@ va P@@ ly@@ no@@ j@@ em with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
All three cities will be joined by a tel@@ ev@@ ised lin@@ k-@@ up at the evening &apos;s close for a united ren@@ dition of The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p &apos;s an@@ them &quot; The End of the World is cancelled &quot;
The concert &apos;s goal is to raise funds to equi@@ p the ST@@ U@@ DE@@ O multi-@@ functional whe@@ el-@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ ed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech cro@@ wns .
Ad@@ mission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Boh@@ em@@ i@@ ati@@ cket .
Poland and the Co@@ smo@@ s .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twen@@ tieth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland &apos;s path to the space had begun much earlier .
Polish b@@ off@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lec@@ ture of A Stern@@ feld in Warsaw &apos;s astronom@@ y ob@@ servatory , who , on the 6th of December 1933 , presented ideas on his pione@@ ering work En@@ try into space .
The thoughts of the young engineer ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later Stern@@ feld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work .
In 19@@ 34 , for his work En@@ try into space , Stern@@ feld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ aul@@ t-@@ Pel@@ terie and Andr@@ e Louis Hir@@ sch prize in France .
The above mentioned Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) later became a strong promot@@ er of astronom@@ y and a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journ@@ als , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
Gad@@ om@@ ski became a world-@@ known promot@@ er of a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cr@@ ater on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him .
In 19@@ 25 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a ro@@ cket engine .
Unfortunately , both the project &apos;s designer , and the project &apos;s details , are unknown .
It is not even clear , whether the ro@@ cket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
In 1933 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started their engagement in flying bom@@ bs .
The research was undertaken by the We@@ ap@@ ons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mi@@ ec@@ zy@@ s@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof. Gu@@ sta@@ w Mo@@ kr@@ zy@@ ck@@ i .
From the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army interrupted the research .
In 19@@ 37 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing ro@@ cket designed by engineer Ro@@ ho@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air tor@@ pe@@ do and flying ro@@ ck@@ et-@@ bomb appeared , au@@ tho@@ red by Le@@ li@@ w@@ y-@@ Kr@@ y@@ w@@ ob@@ lock@@ i .
Both projects were dest@@ ined for military use of ro@@ cket engines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the War , all projects for military use of ro@@ cket technologies were over@@ seen by the Provi@@ sional Scientific Ad@@ visory Board ( Ty@@ m@@ cz@@ as@@ ow@@ y Komit@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ Nau@@ ko@@ w@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
The Board was appointed in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
Further work devoted to a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie To@@ war@@ z@@ yst@@ wo A@@ stron@@ aut@@ y@@ cz@@ ne ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 195@@ 4 , in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
In one of these , by Prof. Sub@@ ot@@ o@@ wi@@ cz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedic@@ ate itself to a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
At the time , there were already projects under@@ way for artificial satelli@@ tes and it was clear that co@@ sm@@ ic research was an emerging sector .
From the beginning of 1956 , the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Federation ( est . 195@@ 1 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member .
In the following year , the P@@ TA &apos;s first chairman , Kaz@@ im@@ ier@@ z Zar@@ ank@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz ( 19@@ 02 - 1959 ) was appointed Dep@@ uty Chairman for the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Federation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959 .
From 1956 , the P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of me@@ te@@ or@@ ological ro@@ ckets R@@ M ( Rak@@ i@@ eta Me@@ te@@ or@@ ologi@@ cz@@ na ) , which became the first Polish ro@@ cket to enable scientific research .
The first R@@ M-@@ 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 .
The ro@@ cket , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weigh@@ ed a little under 5 kg .
Later , the improved R@@ M-@@ 1@@ A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-@@ stage R@@ M-@@ 2 ro@@ cket in the B@@ le@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert .
The ro@@ cket was 1.4 metres in length and weigh@@ ed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M-@@ 34 ro@@ cket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be t@@ asked with monitoring high altitude winds .
Of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
The successor to the R@@ M ro@@ cket type was the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1 ro@@ cket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
The ro@@ cket was designed as a two-@@ stage ro@@ cket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 cm and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
Three models were developed ( designated Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which differ@@ ed in the room available for scientific appar@@ atus .
In the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A ro@@ cket , a space of 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res was available , Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 lit@@ res , and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 lit@@ res .
The maximum altitude for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ km .
Between 1965 and 1968 , the development of Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 was under@@ way in the Aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
The Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 ro@@ cket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
Sub@@ sequently built models were the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 3 .
Poland &apos;s admission to CO@@ SP@@ AR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ SP@@ AR board two years later .
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ ko@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satelli@@ tes , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ wski became the second inter@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut after V@@ ladimir Rem@@ kov .
Ab@@ oli@@ shing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works .
The resolution caused lively public debate .
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the glob@@ alised world , are based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
The cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ controlled financial speculation .
Due to significant labour cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by im@@ porting cheap goods , &quot; the rug is pul@@ led &quot; from under the competition &apos;s prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import che@@ ap@@ ly from abroad , or close down . The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bol@@ stered by the business@@ man &apos;s complete un@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would allevi@@ ate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
The ru@@ th@@ less private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to arti@@ fici@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This occurs chie@@ fly in amendments to existing law .
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long-term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
This yiel@@ ds growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-@@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a sal@@ ary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pres@@ su@@ red by a catastrop@@ hi@@ c drop in living standards to em@@ ig@@ rate as it was in the 19th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on star@@ vation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shi@@ fted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Mor@@ oc@@ can , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fra@@ ction of European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theory and the Media inc@@ ess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ru@@ in .
Private capital cru@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts on the view@@ point that the State must not intervene in the economy .
Ther@@ eu@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own sel@@ fish ends .
Here , the answer must be yes .
The proof is the existence of the almost om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent , and in all states , om@@ ni@@ present lobby .
The result is a desper@@ ate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ is@@ hab@@ le .
In Germany the situation is such that state mini@@ stries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
These laws are then approved in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
Real power does not come from the people as the West@@ ern@@ -@@ style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ ally-@@ orient@@ ated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by App@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Cri@@ sis in the time of Ces@@ ar and Pom@@ pe@@ i : &quot; The State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
With bri@@ ber@@ y , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or s@@ words .
Bri@@ ber@@ y and corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hin@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought &quot; ... &quot; people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole deb@@ ac@@ le meant the state went eight months without consu@@ ls .. &quot; .. &quot; There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cracy , and an energe@@ tic man should be elected . &quot; App@@ ian had Pom@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was Ces@@ ar who changed democracy for auto@@ cracy permanently .
The conclusion , just as in anti@@ qu@@ ity , the current society is built on un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous tenden@@ cies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented dec@@ ad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
The caus@@ ality of the rise of the fasc@@ ist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the mis@@ guided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the dem@@ ise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
The particularly catastrop@@ hi@@ c reality is that the current elite is completely ignor@@ ing the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witn@@ essing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
The abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lower@@ ing the population &apos;s living standards .
This pattern is thus system@@ ic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state &apos;s capital participation in the economy , increase the people &apos;s influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : Chaos Lab .
&quot; Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , &quot; from St@@ ing &apos;s Fra@@ gi@@ le , where one of the main ver@@ ses from the refra@@ in is &quot; L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . &quot;
&quot; If my sons did not want war , there would be none , &quot; said the dying Gut@@ le Schn@@ app@@ er , wife of Ma@@ yer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ schil@@ d in 18@@ 49 .
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has spark@@ ed a lot of reaction .
Some stand by Israel , argu@@ ing it has the right to self-@@ defence , and Palestinians are portra@@ yed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming racism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Ara@@ bs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to d@@ well , in these repeated periodi@@ c waves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gress@@ or and who is the victim , after all , today &apos;s inhabitants of Israel , including the self-@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5-@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four &apos;s declaration in November 19@@ 17 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napole@@ on .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their thr@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-@@ calculated goal .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world &apos;s wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ u@@ des could not happen in one generation &apos;s li@@ fes@@ p@@ an .
Among these astronom@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the pu@@ pp@@ et master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am un@@ sure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ schil@@ ds .
Not much is written about them .
Under@@ stand@@ ably .
The first news agency ( Re@@ uters ) they bought in the 90 &apos;s of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority st@@ akes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the ass@@ ault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ ad@@ da@@ fi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
W@@ ho@@ ever attempted to def@@ y this family died .
Abra@@ ham L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n refused to rene@@ w the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ schil@@ d Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state-@@ issued ) money and was assass@@ inated in 18@@ 65 at the theatre .
J@@ F@@ K began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Con@@ gress@@ man Louis Mc@@ F@@ ad@@ den was po@@ is@@ oned in 19@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929 .
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the form@@ ulation of a three-@@ world-@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ as@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3rd degree , Albert Pi@@ ke .
The first war was to remove the large mon@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world &apos;s population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sla@@ ves will suff@@ ice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ec@@ umen@@ ism is just an ap@@ peti@@ ser for this solution ) , and finally the sei@@ zing of absolute power .
The method , which the group of weal@@ thy families with the Roth@@ schil@@ ds leading the way , employ is the in@@ sti@@ gation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab cha@@ o - order from chaos ) .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 07 would not be repeated ) .
Thus , having succeeded in assass@@ in@@ ating Fer@@ din@@ and , the Hab@@ sburg h@@ eir to the Au@@ stro@@ -@@ Hungarian thr@@ one , in Sar@@ aje@@ vo thereby un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution .
The First World War ended ab@@ rup@@ tly , milit@@ arily and economically un@@ substanti@@ ated , with German capit@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a-@@ Hungary were subsequently disman@@ tled .
To facilitate the inc@@ eption of the Second World War , they allowed ban@@ kers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict situation by s@@ add@@ ling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a ra@@ dic@@ alist example of the im@@ pover@@ ished m@@ asses , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing cul@@ pri@@ t and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi-@@ ra@@ cial Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth col@@ ony , once the war had been ign@@ ited .
At the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ schil@@ ds in@@ sti@@ gated the establishment of the Zi@@ on@@ ist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Retur@@ n to Z@@ ion ) .
The afore@@ mentioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terror@@ ist attacks occurred on both sides .
World War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the le@@ ash , which international ban@@ kers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world &apos;s acceptance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were la@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war &apos;s hot@@ bed .
Provi@@ ded the international ban@@ kers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Arab@@ ic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of dis@@ cor@@ d and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the wron@@ g-@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palest@@ ine-@@ Israel conflict , where in@@ justice bre@@ eds in@@ justice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the gre@@ ed of a few and their lust for global power ?
Here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel &apos;s general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international ban@@ kers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel &apos;s current prime minister , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u &apos; the ha@@ w@@ k &apos; , is a typical example of a fasc@@ ist politi@@ cian , lo@@ yal to the international ban@@ kers , who does everything to in@@ sti@@ gate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Stra@@ it , where 20 % of the world &apos;s oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world &apos;s economy .
In what light stand the words , spoken by David Rock@@ ef@@ eller in 1994 : &quot; All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . &quot;
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave .
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a hand@@ ful of financial ari@@ sto@@ crats .
A world , where each new@@ -@@ born is im@@ plan@@ ted with a chip , which makes their existence completely sub@@ ju@@ gated .
&quot; He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has insight , let him calcul@@ ate the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man &apos;s number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . &quot;
Ar@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
In November 1979 , a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstr@@ ators took over the American emb@@ assy in Teh@@ ran and held 52 diplom@@ ats ho@@ stage .
They were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Sha@@ h Moh@@ am@@ mad Re@@ za P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , who fl@@ ed after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Sha@@ h over@@ board , because this would seriously jeopardi@@ se the trust of other al@@ lied countries .
The release of the host@@ ages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ o@@ cratic regime , could not be achieved .
This was a blow to the pre@@ stige of the United States , which was later compo@@ unded by the fi@@ as@@ co of attempting to free the host@@ ages by force .
The inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated diplom@@ ats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Alger@@ ian government .
Their or@@ deal provo@@ ked a wave of solidarity and anti-@@ Iranian feelings at home .
The deb@@ ac@@ le in Iran significantly influenced Jim@@ my Car@@ ter &apos;s loss with Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan in the 1980 presidential elections .
The film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck , re@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before the emb@@ assy was sei@@ zed , six employees escap@@ ed .
After some peri@@ pet@@ ei@@ a , they ended up in the Canadian amb@@ assador &apos;s residence .
The CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant cover story - they left on Canadian pas@@ sports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -@@ fi block@@ bu@@ ster .
A combination of gen@@ res
The plan , conceived by &quot; ex@@ fil@@ tration &quot; expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fic@@ ti@@ tious production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s film is a pec@@ uli@@ ar mix of gen@@ res .
On one hand , there is a realistic inci@@ sive political thri@@ ller , and at the same time a &quot; cap@@ er movie , &quot; with small vic@@ tories and double-@@ crossing - another example would be Ocean &apos;s Ele@@ ven .
The mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp docum@@ ent@@ ar@@ y-@@ style sequ@@ ences in Teh@@ ran ( the title sequence shows i@@ con@@ ic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , ligh@@ ter sections from Hollywood , lac@@ ed with ir@@ ony and a little exagger@@ ation .
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corri@@ d@@ ors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck has managed to re@@ start his career in extraordinary style .
The deri@@ ded actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ir@@ onic comments .
Ar@@ go is his third big@@ -@@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Baby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thri@@ ller The Town ( 2010 ) .
It is also Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s first picture , which does not take place in the director &apos;s hom@@ et@@ own of Boston .
The atmosp@@ her@@ ic feel in different locations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ le@@ ck shows it in Ar@@ go , where Teh@@ ran is &quot; featured &quot; by Canada .
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the sie@@ ge on the emb@@ assy is impres@@ sively lu@@ ci@@ d , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come floo@@ ding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ le@@ ck and his team in the fic@@ ti@@ tious scenes ( the fa@@ ke staff at the Teh@@ ran ba@@ za@@ ar ) .
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many n@@ ail@@ -@@ bit@@ ing scenes for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some occa@@ sional em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so elegan@@ tly ( the scene , where a lo@@ oming crisis is aver@@ ted at Teh@@ ran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a ch@@ ase on the run@@ way seems quite far-@@ fet@@ ched ) .
Ar@@ go &apos;s weakness is its diver@@ gence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Goo@@ d@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood assi@@ stants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be wat@@ ched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -@@ style are e@@ voc@@ ative of thri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70 &apos;s .
It does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate .
As a remin@@ der of history &apos;s particular ways and a testim@@ ony to how exagger@@ ated the views are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ controlling secret services , this will do .
Rules for b@@ lowing up bal@@ lo@@ ons , for ban@@ anas and a cir@@ cus
The www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server , which issues a pol@@ l every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for &quot; the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . &quot;
&quot; We were promp@@ ted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe &apos;s largest companies , &quot; Patri@@ k Nach@@ er , the pol@@ l &apos;s organis@@ er , told Pra@@ vo .
Among the latest nominated absur@@ di@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to uni@@ fy insurance premi@@ ums for men and women .
Until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insur@@ ers .
&quot; Other un@@ belie@@ vable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , &quot; informed Nach@@ er .
Among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bi@@ o-@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mer@@ cury ther@@ mom@@ eters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chi@@ cken c@@ ages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term &quot; sp@@ read@@ able but@@ ter &quot; and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate ban@@ anas are to measure 14 cen@@ timet@@ res
The Union &apos;s machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lob@@ b@@ ying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states &apos; interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being v@@ et@@ o@@ ed ) .
The lobby &apos;s interests were , for example , that ban@@ anas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and &quot; an@@ om@@ alous cur@@ v@@ ature . &quot;
The European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
Nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives .
One possible pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winner in the pol@@ l may be the last year &apos;s EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able bal@@ lo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without par@@ ental supervision .
Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation .
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blo@@ wers .
St@@ range ideas are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m F@@ Y@@ ROM ( For@@ mer Yugosla@@ v Republic of Macedonia ) should be used .
The Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server in collaboration with the Liberal Econom@@ ist Association , La@@ isse@@ z F@@ aire , also nominated , aside from the afore@@ mentioned absur@@ di@@ ties , for example the Union &apos;s regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU stipul@@ ated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
The Czech Republic there@@ after exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mus@@ h@@ room pre@@ serves , which incurred a high penalty .
The pol@@ l &apos;s organis@@ ers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of al@@ locating funding for a request for funding .
These ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
&quot; We are handic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a refund , &quot; declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Pal@@ as ( CS@@ SD ) .
His argument was that there had been a good harv@@ est of cere@@ als , and due to the so-called bu@@ y-@@ out interventions , the state &apos;s ware@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
The Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros .
The European Commission finally met the CR hal@@ f@@ way by organising a tender for the purchase of cere@@ als from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Fund@@ ing to subsidi@@ se funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development &apos;s minister , P@@ av@@ el N@@ em@@ ec ( US-@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : B@@ iz@@ ar@@ re legislation is the exception
Regul@@ ations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU &apos;s efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
E@@ motions fl@@ are among Cze@@ chs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
The Cze@@ chs fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the labelling of their Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be ren@@ amed tu@@ z@@ em@@ ak by the manufacturers .
The app@@ ell@@ ation of rum can only be given to products di@@ still@@ ed from cane sugar , and not sugar be@@ et .
Carl@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers , Po@@ ho@@ reli@@ cky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world-@@ renowned f@@ eta cheese and gor@@ gon@@ z@@ ola , German mar@@ zip@@ an from Lu@@ beck , and Par@@ ma ham .
The EU &apos;s stam@@ p of protection can also be prou@@ dly shown on Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce g@@ inger@@ bread and H@@ ori@@ cky tu@@ bes .
People want me to save the re@@ public , but I am an am@@ ateur , says Ok@@ am@@ ura
Sen@@ ator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president .
If everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been rob@@ bed over the past twenty years , th@@ ie@@ ves ro@@ aming about there and people &apos;s taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politi@@ cian .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned for@@ ty , and I am an independent non-@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president .
You have already reached the Sen@@ ate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Sen@@ ate &apos;s elections .
Later , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
Therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible .
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we tra@@ mp@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things .
The Media add to this , misleading the public , and mist@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
For example , I was alle@@ ge@@ dly bri@@ bing re@@ por@@ ters , or I was alle@@ ge@@ dly an advis@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
Let &apos;s talk about your vision .
You set out on your castle sie@@ ge with a the@@ sis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial dis@@ closure of assets over twenty million .
You need to change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Sen@@ ate as a whole may propose laws .
How are you going to solve this ?
When I lob@@ bi@@ ed , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
As an independent non-@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or do@@ g@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the Czech view@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ SC@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
You get an@@ gr@@ y when someone calls you a pop@@ u@@ list .
Are you not confir@@ ming this with what you have stated ?
When you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
You try to come close to it .
Some may call it populi@@ sm , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slo@@ gans .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , re@@ por@@ ters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the Att@@ or@@ ney General .
And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frank@@ ly that I am an am@@ ateur , I am not a geni@@ us or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like Ok@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ cur@@ a , who dec@@ lined due to his work@@ load .
So I , at least , support investig@@ ative journalist , Jan@@ a Lor@@ enco@@ va , who un@@ covered frau@@ dul@@ ent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doubts .
Six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
In the sen@@ ate , there are only two independ@@ ents , including me .
People have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
Nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional council pre@@ sidents .
Are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
You have no money ?
You are talking about financial dis@@ clo@@ sures , but what is yours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an art@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ ston Martin worth 3.5 million , a S@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ ston Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James B@@ ond , who dro@@ ve the car , was gall@@ ant with women and also fought against evil and vil@@ la@@ iny .
You drive an A@@ ston Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
You say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not insp@@ ire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I do not have any spon@@ sors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son &apos;s English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This depends on the rate of pay .
As I promised , my activities have been partially reduced .
For example , my dep@@ uty is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
People would like me to be a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an , who sa@@ ves the Republic .
But I must also live off something .
As a business@@ man , what would you usually make monthly ?
Two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
The full interview can be read in Saturday &apos;s issue of Pra@@ vo .
The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architects prove that true advent@@ ures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently er@@ ected Bü@@ cher@@ berg ( literally &quot; book mountain &quot; ) - 2 photos
&quot; I think the building is fun , looks fut@@ ur@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , &quot; said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a pas@@ ser-@@ by at the ro@@ ad-@@ side .
And Stefan Sper@@ mon , IT technici@@ an in a major firm based nearby comm@@ ented : &quot; It &apos;s definitely a thing of beauty , the building . &quot;
However , I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age .
Everyone has the Internet , an i@@ Pad and e@@ Books .
No@@ -@@ one goes into one of these ol@@ d-@@ style libraries volun@@ t@@ arily nowadays , or am I wrong ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the gates of Rotterdam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record@@ -@@ holder .
The 8@@ 0,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ resident municipality has the lowest liter@@ acy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
In order to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recre@@ ate the seven fic@@ ti@@ tious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures .
The success of the education offensive was limited .
And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics : a library had to be built !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as of the Rotter@@ dam@@ -based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of au@@ d@@ acious bar charts and producer of hum@@ or@@ ous and often cy@@ n@@ ical buildings , took the project on with his custom@@ ary com@@ posure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a gr@@ in on his face .
And with the jud@@ ging panel still looking at him with be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment , shr@@ u@@ gging their shoul@@ ders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent Ma@@ as st@@ ack@@ ed his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a py@@ ra@@ mid and rounded off his presentation - now su@@ itably backed up with action - with the words : &quot; De@@ ar Municip@@ ality ! &quot;
So this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Book Mountain - for the so-called Bo@@ ek@@ enberg !
N@@ ine years later , the 30-@@ milli@@ on-@@ euro mountain has been li@@ fted up .
It is part of a re@@ vit@@ alisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a super@@ market , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terra@@ ced houses , with a total of 50 d@@ well@@ ings .
At the beginning of November , the Bü@@ cher@@ berg was awarded second place in the &quot; Best Library of NL 2012 &quot; competition .
In addition , the project is also nominated for the Dutch National W@@ ood Award 2012 .
Thus , the fac@@ eless small-@@ town ret@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-@@ modern pedestrian area and a stun@@ n@@ ingly ug@@ ly town hall , behind whose white fac@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
First and foremost , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
The long journey to the book
The first impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books bene@@ ath a cheese d@@ ome .
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mountain massi@@ f , however , the true jo@@ ys of space and literature are revealed when sc@@ aling the to@@ po@@ graphy on foot .
The interior space , gla@@ zed throughout , is bright and open , the fi@@ red clin@@ ker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able language of a public town square .
The urban ambiance is perfect .
You are already on the lo@@ ok@@ out for a park ben@@ ch , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
And everywhere there are books , books , books .
&quot; Norm@@ ally book shel@@ ves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually un@@ pleasant and im@@ personal , &quot; says Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
We turned the classical spati@@ al configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
The interior of the Bü@@ cher@@ berg is cle@@ ver@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a ch@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
One particularly special feature are the black book shel@@ ves , which simultaneously act as wall cl@@ adding , par@@ ap@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the sta@@ ir@@ way .
The appearance , feel and sc@@ ent are foreign .
Even di@@ e-@@ hard architects and construction engineers sha@@ ke their heads at the unknown construction materials .
&quot; Here we wanted to work with recy@@ cl@@ able materials , &quot; explained J@@ oo@@ p Tro@@ ub@@ or@@ st , Project Manager for the Municip@@ ality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standard .
And thus one day we st@@ umb@@ led across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fri@@ sian farm .
For many years , milli@@ met@@ re-@@ thick artificial fabric has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
It is in@@ expensive and sa@@ ves time .
The thin textile la@@ sts for two seasons and is then dis@@ posed of as bulk waste .
For the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-@@ cen@@ timet@@ re-@@ thick boards .
Under heat and pressure , the so-called Land@@ bou@@ w plastic ( KL@@ P ) changes colour to a dark , homo@@ gene@@ ous and robust material , that sm@@ ells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of train@@ ers .
After 105 steps you have reached the summit .
At the end of the 500@@ -@@ me@@ ter-@@ long journey , you are rewar@@ ded in the Liter@@ ature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ ettes and pot@@ ted fic@@ us trees .
These provide atmosphere , but most importantly , regulate the air hum@@ i@@ dity in the literary mountain range .
Don@@ ations for the new soul
&quot; You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a show@@ case project in the area of ec@@ ology , &quot; said Tro@@ ub@@ or@@ st .
It is heated and cool@@ ed using geo@@ thermal heat .
Although the Bü@@ cher@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only sh@@ ines only briefly into the interior , even on sunny days .
The broad , lam@@ inated wood glu@@ e be@@ ams positioned at right-@@ ang@@ les to the glass fac@@ ade , provide sha@@ de and absor@@ b the majority of the sun@@ light .
The indoor temperature is very pleasant .
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic ro@@ ller blin@@ ds .
Stefan Sper@@ mon , initially a scep@@ tic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new library .
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also visited already .
So too has T@@ C@@ M-@@ teacher , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Bo@@ garde , who even refers to the Bo@@ ek@@ enberg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse &apos;s &quot; long over@@ due soul . &quot;
The reason : At the inau@@ gu@@ ration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to don@@ ate a book from his / her personal collection .
This was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully sto@@ cked library - currently there are 70@@ ,000 items .
The concept has been a success .
The shel@@ ves are full to capacity .
&quot; Nothing is worse than a half-@@ empty library , &quot; said architect Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
&quot; I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
Even if it &apos;s just for decoration .
As such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in ma@@ stering the master discipline that specialist jar@@ gon refers to as the formation of identity .
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written literary history .
However young and un@@ educated it may be .
This is ultimately a starting point for identity .
Sz@@ ab@@ o : &quot; Germans must play a greater role &quot;
In the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting .
According to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US-@@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche Welle : At the beginning of the week , Germany had initially sign@@ alled that it would vote against the Palestinians &apos; application for ob@@ server status within the United Nations .
However , Berlin subsequently abstained from voting .
Why ?
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
Now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cau@@ tious .
At the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel .
During the u@@ pris@@ ing in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no-@@ fly zone .
This was ultimately implemented by NATO .
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
Yes , it does .
That is because it has just re@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
This situation is ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardis@@ ed policy .
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fron@@ ts .
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accu@@ stom@@ ed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a &quot; more normal &quot; foreign policy .
A foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
So what specifically does a &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy ent@@ ail , from a German perspective ?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East .
Germany &apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
On the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
Therefore it must be careful not to aff@@ ront the public , but also the elite in the Arab@@ ic countries .
In any case , this plays a role .
However , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to as@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this . This is not an entirely one-@@ sided relationship .
Nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany &apos;s considerations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by absta@@ ining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prev@@ ails .
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fra@@ c@@ ture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
After all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto .
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
Due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
I think that secre@@ tly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
However , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u &apos;s policies .
Does Germany find it difficult to re@@ conci@@ le its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardis@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case .
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in ur@@ ging Europe towards a standardis@@ ed European position .
This is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive subject .
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be un@@ comfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti-@@ German feelings become apparent .
This does not make matters simple for the Germans .
This is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hosti@@ le countries .
From this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
It must be recep@@ tive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy .
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually dimin@@ ishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , even if it is un@@ comfortable and makes them even more un@@ popular - c &apos;@@ est la vie !
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o is associ@@ ate director of the Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Academy in Washington , an institute in which academ@@ ics and political experts from Europe and North America come together to research the challenges of the transatlantic community .
Sz@@ ab@@ o is also a member of the German Mar@@ shall Fund , in which he has specialised in German policy , US foreign policy and transatlantic relations .
&quot; Brand protection &quot; in China : When P@@ uma and Ar@@ man@@ i suddenly become Chinese
Ar@@ man@@ i is a world-@@ famous brand , Polo R@@ al@@ ph Lau@@ ren likewise .
However , what is Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ?
Beh@@ ind this name hi@@ des a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
Nonetheless , it is enjoying protection , provided the actual cre@@ ators of the names do not su@@ e .
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
&quot; It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , &quot; said Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer within the Ta@@ yl@@ or W@@ essing law firm , who speciali@@ ses in copyright infringement in the Far East .
Every week a new case lands on my desk .
All the copy@@ c@@ ats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands .
Thus Gu@@ cc@@ i simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Gu@@ cc@@ i , Pra@@ da-@@ K@@ ny is registered in place of Pra@@ da .
German companies are also &apos; legally &apos; copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting app@@ arel , P@@ uma .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens a file containing regi@@ strations with the trademark office in Peking .
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copy@@ righ@@ ted the brand name Ze@@ gna DF P@@ uma there , an ali@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion re@@ ta@@ iler Er@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Ze@@ gna .
The fact that the Chinese are world champ@@ ions in copying and inf@@ ring@@ ing on intellectual property is well-known .
In the major cities there are multi-@@ level department stores that sell counter@@ f@@ eit goods almost exclusively .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch &apos;s cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
The Chinese call this &quot; B@@ ang M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , &quot; a passenger brand .
The word is based on &quot; B@@ ang D@@ aku@@ an . &quot;
This refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any wron@@ g@@ doing .
&quot; This har@@ ms business and we must fight against it , &quot; challenges P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; The brand is water@@ ed down , its uniqu@@ eness dis@@ appears - the image damage is enormous . &quot;
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flag@@ ship products .
According to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing .
However , the dele@@ tion of du@@ bi@@ ous entries in the trademark regi@@ stry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty p@@ enny .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch reports of instances whereby the court dis@@ mis@@ ses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objec@@ tion is being raised has become a &quot; market reality . &quot;
If the compla@@ in@@ ant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist money for having inf@@ ring@@ ed on his trademark in China , said P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
Sometimes the law of the jung@@ le prev@@ ails here .
Fam@@ ous cases also relate to graphic elements .
In 2009 , Daim@@ ler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer P@@ utz@@ meister .
Even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an em@@ ble@@ m that res@@ embles the Merce@@ des star .
Vol@@ vo@@ -@@ purchaser Ge@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that res@@ emb@@ led the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbit@@ rated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it .
Fas@@ hion house Lac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against copy@@ c@@ ats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous cro@@ codi@@ le looking in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any wron@@ g@@ doing .
The CT@@ M@@ O trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks in 2010 due to limited staff@@ ing and equipment .
In the past year , however , things re@@ porte@@ dly &quot; returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . &quot;
Thus the stock of un@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
Almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
Nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,@@ 500 appe@@ als waiting to be resolved in the office .
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
In the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CT@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and means that China , for the tent@@ h time in succ@@ ession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
The same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks , tot@@ alling 5.@@ 5 million in number .
In 2011 , 1.@@ 8 billion y@@ u@@ an in fees were received .
P@@ ut simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 280 y@@ u@@ an , or 160 euros .
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Freu@@ den@@ berg .
For more than seven years , the group has been con@@ testing against a Chinese pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist .
The Germans did in fact manage to ex@@ pose the company &apos;s illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
However , the copy@@ cat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freu@@ den@@ berg brand .
This is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said H@@ ann@@ o W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Freu@@ den@@ berg Chem@@ ical Speci@@ alities in Munich .
The CT@@ M@@ O trademark office then also dis@@ missed the Mun@@ ich@@ -based company &apos;s appeal .
In the next two instances , Freu@@ den@@ berg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
You have to pay extremely careful attention .
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court .
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ ises the professionalism of the courts .
However , he also says : &quot; The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . &quot;
The internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through cent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old records in order to provide proof .
Five years ago Freu@@ den@@ berg un@@ successfully offered the opposing party a &quot; high six-@@ figure sum in euros &quot; as settlement .
&quot; This shows how much this is worth to us , &quot; says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ illing over , back into Europe .
Partic@@ ularly if im@@ it@@ ators secure un@@ protected brand names there .
For example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freu@@ den@@ berg label for shoes and leather in Germany .
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration .
&quot; You have to pay extremely careful attention , &quot; says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Both he and P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register &quot; everything &quot; that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , &quot; said W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee .
In actual fact : if Freu@@ den@@ berg were to loose at the final hur@@ dle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Or altern@@ atively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .
World AIDS day : St@@ om@@ p , sing , help
In Heidelberg , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir is re@@ hear@@ sing - and in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , AIDS orph@@ ans are delighted .
The history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,@@ 7@@ 33 kilometres .
First of all , the stamp@@ ing : co@@ w@@ boy bo@@ ots , bas@@ ketball shoes , ladies &apos; pumps and men &apos;s lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that .
O@@ ne-@@ two-@@ three-@@ four .
Only then do the voices of the sing@@ ers slowly s@@ well - alto , bass , ten@@ or and s@@ op@@ ran@@ o sur@@ ge , be@@ gui@@ le and ha@@ unt .
And F@@ iete Hop@@ f , the 29@@ -@@ year-old conductor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ens@@ emble together with his smooth , yet wild gest@@ ures .
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Heidelberg the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i Cho@@ ir are practi@@ sing a new song .
The fifteen sing@@ ers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tici@@ sts to the maintenance man .
&quot; O@@ m &apos;@@ O@@ ban@@ i &quot; is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Zul@@ u , which is spoken by ele@@ ven million people in South Africa , Bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a , Les@@ o@@ th@@ o , Mal@@ aw@@ i , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and in parts of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and .
Hel@@ ping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the estim@@ ations of Un@@ ai@@ ds , the United Nations &apos; programme to battle AIDS .
Of these , 2@@ 3.5 million live in South Africa .
In S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , there are 24@@ 5,000 AIDS orph@@ ans .
Meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
The Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found spon@@ sors in Germany for 180 AIDS orph@@ ans in the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i .
70 of these attend a secondary school .
For 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a spon@@ sor .
This guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Go@@ go Centre .
In Zul@@ u , I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i means stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller or wor@@ shi@@ pper .
In this region , no-@@ one can speak the B@@ ant@@ u language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
For almost ten years the cho@@ ir has been practi@@ sing songs in this foreign , &apos; soft &apos; language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
For an 8,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3-@@ kilomet@@ re flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , which reli@@ es on the vocal power of the German cho@@ ir .
For@@ ty percent are infected .
Around 2@@ ,000 people live there , some still in simple mu@@ d and stra@@ w hu@@ ts , and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succ@@ um@@ bed to the HIV virus .
In E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i you get a small fo@@ res@@ ha@@ dow of the illness from which all of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and is suffering : according to Un@@ ic@@ ef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expec@@ tan@@ cy in the world .
Cir@@ cum@@ ci@@ sion , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely practi@@ sed by the population .
More than for@@ ty percent of people in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and carry the imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus , and dying in you mid-@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the Cho@@ ir visited the village , but first and foremost , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in par@@ ental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
Without a school leaving certificate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
Initi@@ ally it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
However , just one year later , the cho@@ ir established the &quot; Vo@@ ices for Africa &quot; Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orph@@ ans in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level .
F@@ acts on sex@@ ually transmitted infec@@ tions .
What are the most important sex@@ ually transmitted diseases ?
B@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial ST@@ Is include s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
Common vi@@ ral ST@@ Is are HIV , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses , her@@ pes gen@@ itali@@ s and h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis .
Cra@@ bs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the par@@ asi@@ tic ST@@ Is .
Who are the main affected groups ?
S@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea occur primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men .
The Robert Ko@@ ch Institute understands that at least four in five of all s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
Among hetero@@ sexual adults , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions , tri@@ ch@@ om@@ oni@@ asis , candi@@ di@@ asis ( f@@ ung@@ al ) , gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea and human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are frequently occurring sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
The spread of HIV among hetero@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV are found in this group .
Among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions are much more common than in other population groups .
According to European surveys , three quarters of all infec@@ tions affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
In this country , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
How has the number of infec@@ tions developed ?
Not all sex@@ ually transmitted diseases are noti@@ fiable .
According to the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute , the number of s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis infec@@ tions has more than doub@@ led from 1,@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3,@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
The number of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
In 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cases .
This is around one tent@@ h fewer than the previous year .
Which symptoms indicate a sex@@ ually transmitted disease ?
The infec@@ tious diseases can cause ul@@ c@@ ers in the gen@@ ital area , dis@@ comfort when ur@@ in@@ ating , discharge , lower ab@@ domin@@ al pain and bli@@ sters or war@@ ts .
However , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining un@@ detected .
How can you protect yourself ?
Con@@ d@@ oms can reduce the risk of contra@@ ction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
This is because occasionally , the pa@@ tho@@ gens of sex@@ ually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via sme@@ ar infec@@ tions and close bo@@ di@@ ly contact .
Therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners under@@ go regular exam@@ inations .
If diagno@@ sed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be cu@@ red and long-term consequences avoided .
Through spon@@ sor@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the cho@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
&quot; In total , we have already sent around 200@@ ,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , &quot; said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , Chair@@ person of the association .
In the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a self-@@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , manages the money from Germany .
She makes sure that the orph@@ ans have good accommodation , for example with one of their grand@@ mothers .
The Go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Zul@@ u , are the pillars of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 orph@@ ans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes pun@@ c@@ tually every day , in their school uni@@ forms .
Anyone who doesn &apos;t have anyone left , arri@@ ves at the shel@@ ter with K@@ han@@ y@@ isi@@ le , a single woman who ear@@ ns the same sal@@ ary from the association as the two coo@@ ks who co@@ ok for more than 200 hung@@ ry children every day .
In addition , &quot; Vo@@ ices for Africa &quot; has established a se@@ wing school , built two chi@@ cken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , PS@@ I , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wra@@ ps is if people are dead .
A king with 14 wi@@ ves
&quot; AIDS is an absolute t@@ abo@@ o subject , &quot; said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , &quot; because it is associated with sexu@@ ality . &quot;
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wi@@ ves .
The last absolute mon@@ arch of sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ aran Africa , King M@@ s@@ wat@@ i III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
Poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
Among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanc@@ tioned lifestyle .
Another factor is the large number of m@@ igrant workers who carry the virus across the country .
There are free con@@ d@@ oms on every corner , said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , &quot; but they are hardly used .
The culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - fl@@ es@@ h to fl@@ es@@ h . &quot;
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir tra@@ vels through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and black self-@@ este@@ em , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apar@@ thei@@ d .
A bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only mor@@ ale and joy , but some gri@@ m-@@ faced border soldiers even shed a few te@@ ars .
The journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , where the sing@@ ers visit their spon@@ sor children .
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well-known in the valley of the E@@ zu@@ l@@ wen@@ i River .
&quot; Go to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , that &apos;s where the light is , &quot; say the people there .
And if you make the 8,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3-@@ kilomet@@ re flight back to Heidelberg , to visit the st@@ omp@@ ing sing@@ ers in their re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room , you &apos;ll see that the light is there too .
Messenger : N@@ ASA dis@@ covers ice on Mer@@ cury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
The US space agency , N@@ ASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
Although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine &quot; Science . &quot;
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow .
This is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ timet@@ res and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
The water pre@@ sum@@ ably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that imp@@ acted with Mer@@ cury .
However , no-@@ one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scienti@@ st for the Messenger probe , S@@ ean Sol@@ om@@ on .
The temperature on Mer@@ cury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Cel@@ sius .
That said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system .
Un@@ known to the majority of the Earth &apos;s inhabitants , there are prob@@ es , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and small robots such as the Phoen@@ ix , deployed to research the dep@@ ths of the universe .
From time to time , they trans@@ mit images to Earth : small pe@@ ep@@ holes into the infin@@ ite expan@@ se .
This image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute .
The eight plan@@ ets of our solar system , plus the d@@ war@@ f planet Cer@@ es .
Like Plu@@ to , which or@@ bits around the sun behind Nep@@ tune , Cer@@ es is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International Astronom@@ ical Union in 2006 .
This image section from an infra@@ red recording by the Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope shows a &quot; family portra@@ it &quot; of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are seen as blue d@@ ots , while more difficult to identify are the p@@ ink@@ -@@ coloured &quot; new@@ -@@ bor@@ ns &quot; in the star delivery room .
This star@@ -@@ forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope in the C@@ assi@@ op@@ ei@@ a con@@ stell@@ ation , at a distance of 6,@@ 500 light years away .
This shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing g@@ low of a dying star was captured by N@@ ASA &apos;s Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope .
The don@@ ut@@ -@@ shaped ring consists of material , e@@ jec@@ ted by the star in the process of dying .
In the huge Tri@@ fi@@ d Neb@@ ula , 5,@@ 400 light years away from the Earth , new stars are created from gas and dust .
N@@ ASA &apos;s Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope shot this photo of the gal@@ ac@@ tic delivery room .
The P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster , also referred to as &quot; The Seven S@@ ist@@ ers , &quot; can be seen with the bare eye at night .
With the tel@@ es@@ cope , however , the colours really come into their own .
In this infra@@ red photo , the Heli@@ x Neb@@ ula looks back at the ob@@ server like a red eye .
It is located 700 light years away in the Aqu@@ ari@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation .
Its simil@@ arity with the continent resulted in this Neb@@ ula acqu@@ iring the title &apos; North America &apos; .
A combination of normal and infra@@ red photography produced the spectacular col@@ ouring .
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spit@@ zer tel@@ es@@ cope &apos;s infra@@ red dete@@ c@@ tors .
Satur@@ n and its rings : How these occurred is the greatest pu@@ zzle in the field of astronom@@ y .
Perhaps they are the rem@@ n@@ ants of a moon of Satur@@ n , which disappeared without a trace 4.@@ 5 billion years ago .
One of the largest and shar@@ p@@ est pictures from the Hub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope : the Whirlpool Galax@@ y
Depending on the col@@ ouring , photographs of spi@@ ral galax@@ ies can become genuine works of art .
The photogra@@ ph published by the European Southern Ob@@ servatory shows the Tri@@ fi@@ d Neb@@ ula in the S@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation , several thousand light years away .
The name Tri@@ fi@@ d st@@ ems from the Latin word tri@@ fi@@ dus ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stri@@ pes of dust divide the core of the birth@@ place of stars into three parts .
In the Op@@ hi@@ u@@ ch@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation , astronom@@ ers have photograph@@ ed the signs of a co@@ sm@@ ic col@@ li@@ sion : 400 million light years from the earth , the co@@ res of two mer@@ ging galax@@ ies move rapidly towards one another , dest@@ ined to col@@ li@@ de .
This star birth was captured by the Hub@@ ble tel@@ es@@ cope in the M@@ 83 spi@@ ral galax@@ y .
Anyone who doesn &apos;t like technical ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its nick@@ name , the Southern Ca@@ ther@@ ine Whe@@ el .
The photo taken by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope shows a section of the Ir@@ is Neb@@ ula in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us con@@ stell@@ ation .
The ne@@ bul@@ a , 1,@@ 400 light years away , consists of partic@@ les of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust .
This image was put together from the X-@@ ray images captured by various tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
It shows a ring of black holes , 4@@ 30 million light years away from the Earth .
This group of galax@@ ies , named Ar@@ p 27@@ 3 , was pic@@ tured for N@@ ASA by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope .
Scienti@@ sts call the larger spi@@ ral galax@@ y U@@ G@@ C 18@@ 10 .
This star ne@@ bul@@ a is home to the brigh@@ test group of young stars in our Mil@@ ky Way .
This &apos; star cra@@ dle &apos; continually produces new young@@ sters .
Likewise , this star clou@@ d , connected to the Ro@@ set@@ te Neb@@ ula , continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the Earth .
In this bright sh@@ ining galax@@ y with one small black hole , there exists no dust - only gas .
Res@@ ear@@ chers pre@@ su@@ me that it only came into being shortly after the Big B@@ ang , when the universe was comp@@ ris@@ ed primarily of hydro@@ gen .
Our view of the universe : the most important tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es
The tel@@ es@@ cope is thought to have been invented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Li@@ p@@ per@@ h@@ ey - even before Galileo Galile@@ i used the device to observe the stars one year later .
Since then , the mir@@ rors in optical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insi@@ ghts that they provide increasingly profound .
For a period of 30 years , namely from 1947 until 1975 , the H@@ ale tel@@ es@@ cope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Ob@@ servatory near San Die@@ go was the largest tel@@ es@@ cope in the world .
The mirror , shown in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
Ari@@ zona , USA , is home to the Large B@@ ino@@ cular Tel@@ es@@ cope .
It enables views of space via two mir@@ rors , each with a diameter of 8.@@ 4 metres .
The inner work@@ ings of the Gran Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ io Can@@ ari@@ as on the Can@@ arian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.@@ 4 metres .
The mirror of the Southern African Large Tel@@ es@@ cope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs .
In spite of this it achie@@ ves a diameter of around ele@@ ven metres .
The disadvantage of this in@@ expensive construction method : the tel@@ es@@ cope is sec@@ u@@ rely cl@@ amp@@ ed at its angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited .
The Hob@@ by E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ es@@ cope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation .
What sets it apart : the high ligh@@ t-@@ gathering capacity .
This - in spite of its compar@@ atively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world &apos;s largest refle@@ c@@ tor tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
With the help of a radio tel@@ es@@ cope in A@@ reci@@ bo ( Puerto R@@ ico ) researchers can listen for ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al signals in space .
The radio tel@@ es@@ cope has a diameter of 30@@ 5 metres .
In the &quot; Search for Ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al Intel@@ ligence &quot; ( S@@ ET@@ I ) every computer owner can be of assistance , by making his / her processing capacity available .
View of the European Southern Ob@@ servatory ( ES@@ O ) in the Chi@@ lean An@@ des .
This is home to the Very Large Tel@@ es@@ cope , which lives up to its name .
With its total of four mir@@ rors , the tel@@ es@@ cope can also focus on the medi@@ al infra@@ red spectrum .
Likewise to be located at the ES@@ O Ob@@ servatory in Chile , the European Extre@@ m@@ ely Large Tel@@ es@@ cope is also being planned .
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
However , images are not to be expected until 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
Until 2007 , the two K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es at the Ha@@ wai@@ ian volcan@@ o , Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , were the largest in the world .
They each have two mir@@ rors , each with a diameter of ten meters .
The K@@ eck Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a Ob@@ servatory , which alongside the K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the Sub@@ ar@@ u tel@@ es@@ cope and the IR@@ TT@@ F .
Another huge new tel@@ es@@ cope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , with a mirror diameter of thirty metres .
Here you can mar@@ vel at an artist &apos;s impression .
However , the most important insi@@ ghts into space are provided by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope .
Since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ es@@ cope has been searching for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be inhab@@ itable .
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by N@@ ASA that 1,@@ 23@@ 5 plan@@ etary candidates had been identified since the mission began .
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ es@@ cope .
The James Web@@ b Space Tel@@ es@@ cope ( J@@ W@@ ST ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ ane@@ 5 ro@@ cket by 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
The primary mirror of the infra@@ red space tel@@ es@@ cope has a diameter of 6.@@ 5 metres .
One of the tel@@ es@@ cope &apos;s tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galax@@ ies that emerged after the Big B@@ ang .
Scienti@@ sts are assuming that ice also exists at Mer@@ cury &apos;s south p@@ ole .
However , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger or@@ bits around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north p@@ ole .
For decades , ra@@ dar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mer@@ cury .
Thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to or@@ bit Mer@@ cury , scientists can now be certain .
Dr@@ ink but@@ ter on a daily basis - and live to 16@@ 8 years of age
In Southern Azer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an , many people reach bi@@ b@@ lical ages .
There is even a museum of lon@@ ge@@ vity .
A hun@@ t for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
In Southern Azer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an , many people reach ages that can almost be considered bi@@ b@@ lical .
There is even a museum of lon@@ ge@@ vity .
A hun@@ t for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
The journey through the T@@ aly@@ sh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic .
The mini@@ bus ru@@ mb@@ les over the win@@ ding streets , past den@@ sely woo@@ ded hills , ra@@ ging rivers and simple farm@@ houses .
Every@@ where is green and lush - you could be for@@ given for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
However , this is the deep south of Azer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
This is the home of the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an people group , the T@@ aly@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Per@@ sian and Azer@@ i and live long lives .
The final stop is L@@ eri@@ k .
The small town is bur@@ sting with over@@ power@@ ing architecture from Soviet times , which doesn &apos;t fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all .
Tou@@ rists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an &apos;s capital city , Bak@@ u , is too ar@@ du@@ ous .
It takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track .
The fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Cas@@ pi@@ an Sea to thank , has not yet arri@@ ves here in the province .
Yet Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
&quot; Bak@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision Song Con@@ test , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , &quot; said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
She is the Director of the Museum of Lon@@ ge@@ vity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
Here the lives of eight do@@ zen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva points out a black &amp; white photo .
This here is my grand@@ father , he was 120 years old .
At the age of 13@@ 6 he fa@@ ther@@ ed another child .
However , the un@@ ri@@ v@@ alled star of the museum is sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d Shi@@ r@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 16@@ 8 years old .
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this .
And given that the longest confirmed li@@ fes@@ p@@ an was 12@@ 2 years of age , Musli@@ mo@@ v &apos;s claim seems extremely doub@@ tful .
&quot; He was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , &quot; explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
The man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fa@@ ther@@ ed another daughter at the age of 13@@ 6 .
So did Shi@@ r@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calcul@@ ate his age by a couple of decades ?
But Rem@@ br@@ andt Sch@@ olz , resear@@ cher on ageing at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute in Ro@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
&quot; A stri@@ k@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan , &quot; said Sch@@ olz , &quot; while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sard@@ inia . &quot;
Due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth regi@@ sters .
Mel@@ ted but@@ ter by the glass , every day
However , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a bi@@ b@@ lical age with striking regul@@ arity .
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
So why do so many very old people live here in the south ?
The Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ ari@@ d Mu@@ gi@@ m@@ z@@ ade@@ h explains this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh gene@@ tics .
In contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva believes that it is due to diet .
However the notion that the cal@@ or@@ ie-@@ rich diet of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of mel@@ ted but@@ ter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plau@@ sible either .
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? In C@@ en@@ gem@@ i@@ ran , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Rub@@ aba Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
At 97 years old she is still compar@@ atively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 14@@ 3 des@@ cen@@ dants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
She si@@ ts on the floor with a but@@ ter chur@@ n , which she roll@@ s back@@ wards and for@@ wards ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
Ei@@ ght people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grand@@ parents for some time .
There are also two small children running around .
In the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging Ar@@ ma@@ du gl@@ asses .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , bene@@ ath her head@@ scar@@ f she conce@@ als long , dark bl@@ ond pla@@ its , which her son prou@@ dly reveals for us .
I have always wash@@ ed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
&quot; I have never used sh@@ am@@ po@@ o either , &quot; said Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
Mon@@ thly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever e@@ aten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ ato@@ es , pot@@ ato@@ es , pe@@ as .
My whole life I have never once bought gro@@ c@@ eries in the super@@ market .
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
Th@@ ings were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
However , everything became better when the &quot; bel@@ o@@ ved father &quot; He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ ye@@ v took the ru@@ d@@ der .
The propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady .
Yet the cul@@ t that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dict@@ ator practically knows no limits in Azer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an .
He held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the hel@@ m .
At least there is no de@@ priv@@ ation among Azer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an &apos;s elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva receives 230 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
And perhaps Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s long gre@@ ying son is right : &quot; The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . &quot;
They live among their extended family , are loved , c@@ ared for and are happy .
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
The notion of &quot; human rights &quot; is om@@ it@@ ted from the constitution .
The revolution has returned to Cairo .
Comp@@ eting demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country .
The future constitution based on Sh@@ aria law is fi@@ erc@@ ely disp@@ uted .
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion .
We must make the transition .
&quot; And making sure it succ@@ ee@@ ds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , &quot; he said on state television .
His speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liber@@ als , en@@ ligh@@ tened Muslims and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts .
For all of them , until now hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly est@@ ran@@ ged in a be@@ wil@@ dered opposition , are f@@ ear@@ ful .
They are f@@ ear@@ ful of a God State on the Ni@@ le at the mer@@ cy of the powerful Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
According to Moh@@ amed Mur@@ si , speaking almost ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , &quot; in order to rescue the revolution . &quot;
However , Egyp@@ ti@@ ans - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 6@@ 1-@@ year-old engineer who holds a Doc@@ torate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
Should the judiciary be deprived of power ?
In actual fact , the 23@@ 4 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islam@@ ic-@@ dominated 1@@ 10-@@ person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern .
As was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the draft ju@@ dic@@ ature is justified on the &quot; principles of Islamic law . &quot;
Yet what are &quot; principles &quot; ?
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islam@@ ists will make use of the wo@@ ol@@ ly form@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal manoeu@@ vre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sh@@ aria law .
This is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Sh@@ aria law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country &apos;s most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sun@@ ni Islam .
This can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the cl@@ ergy will over@@ see legislation , which would result in the de facto incap@@ ac@@ itation of the judiciary .
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be up@@ held .
During M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak &apos;s rule , these courts served to sup@@ press opposition .
Following the fall of the dict@@ ator , up to 11@@ ,000 civilians were under military im@@ prison@@ ment .
According to the draft , the state should also protect &quot; the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its mor@@ als and values . &quot;
From a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cin@@ em@@ atic art and literature .
In plain language , this is nothing other than c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women .
Another does prohi@@ bit the insu@@ lt or s@@ lander of the pro@@ ph@@ et Moh@@ amed and his emis@@ s@@ aries .
However , what constitutes an insu@@ lt and how this should be sanc@@ tioned remains unclear .
Equ@@ ally du@@ bi@@ ous is the form@@ ulation stating that &quot; insul@@ ting people &quot; is forbidden .
Is a car@@ ic@@ ature of the president sufficient , or a jo@@ ke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ?
Open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by Mur@@ si to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for referendum &quot; very soon . &quot;
&quot; The revolution is back &quot;
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islam@@ ists .
T@@ ens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square in Cairo , in un@@ familiar unity , and ple@@ dged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
&quot; The revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ t@@ orious , &quot; said Ham@@ din Sab@@ bah@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
Nob@@ le Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Authority , Moh@@ amed El@@ -@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i explained that the constitutional draft belongs &quot; on the rub@@ b@@ ish tip of history . &quot;
Via SMS service Twitter , he accused Mur@@ si &apos;s fol@@ lo@@ wers of wanting to lead &quot; a coup against democracy . &quot;
&quot; If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and over@@ throw him , &quot; said member of the opposition J@@ asser Sa@@ id .
&quot; We have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been at@@ oned for , &quot; stated the Egyptian media , quot@@ ing opposition politi@@ cian Chal@@ ed Ali .
And several judges have sign@@ alled that they do not want to over@@ see the referendum , which would render it invali@@ d .
&quot; The Kor@@ an is our constitution &quot;
The well-@@ organised Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood gathered for a counter-@@ demonstration , although acting cau@@ ti@@ ously they did not choose the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square but rather a mass pra@@ yer on the other side of the Ni@@ le , outside the Cairo University .
Many vei@@ led women and fol@@ lo@@ wers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , sh@@ ou@@ ting out : &quot; The people demand the application of God &apos;s law . &quot;
They demanded of Mur@@ si : &quot; Clean@@ se the country ! &quot; and prote@@ sted : &quot; The Kor@@ an is our constitution . &quot;
A struggle for control over the symbolic T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provo@@ ked events ver@@ ging on civil war .
Quite clearly , this was something that Mur@@ si &apos;s fol@@ lo@@ wers did not want to risk .
The Muslim Bro@@ thers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the population decide at the bal@@ lot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islam@@ ists &apos; draft .
&quot; The term &apos; human rights &apos; does not even appear once &quot;
Haf@@ ez Abu Sa@@ e@@ da is fu@@ ri@@ ous about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have la@@ sted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
The 4@@ 8-@@ year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , when im@@ pris@@ oned or in court under M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak .
Not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indi@@ visible .
For this he was bat@@ tered , condemned and im@@ pris@@ oned .
&quot; And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , &quot; he be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with &quot; Welt am Sonntag . &quot;
The lawyer has re@@ signed himself to Mur@@ si extending his power to all three branches of state government .
These measures are b@@ lat@@ ant bre@@ aches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship .
&quot; Instead of strengthening the civil society , the President is effectively suspen@@ ding it , &quot; compla@@ ined Sa@@ e@@ da .
Yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function .
Sa@@ e@@ da feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is ob@@ serving the battle over the ideological direction on the Ni@@ le with a mixture of curi@@ osity and exc@@ itement .
This could come back to ha@@ unt them .
One demonstr@@ ator at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r warned : &quot; You are letting loose a mon@@ ster that you can no longer control . &quot;
Norway &apos;s rak@@ fis@@ k : Is this the world &apos;s sm@@ elli@@ est fish ?
Norway &apos;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
Could the secret of the country &apos;s success be connected to the local ap@@ peti@@ te for some exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly sm@@ el@@ ly fish ?
Take a selection of over-@@ ri@@ pe che@@ eses .
Place them in the midst of a pi@@ le of dirty , wet so@@ ccer kit .
Le@@ ave for a week .
Now you have the no@@ se-@@ num@@ bing smell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwe@@ gian delic@@ acies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
There is snow , spectacular scenery - and that od@@ our , ever present , han@@ gs in the air .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is tro@@ ut sprin@@ kl@@ ed with salt and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ el@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year .
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norwe@@ gi@@ ans flo@@ ck to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
&quot; You eat it raw , and then s@@ wal@@ low a glass of aqu@@ av@@ it , &quot; says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full-@@ time local fire@@ figh@@ ter but also the so-called &quot; Rak@@ fis@@ k General , &quot; in charge of running the festival .
All around us people are eating little c@@ ub@@ es of the fish and kno@@ cking back quantities of drink .
&quot; Some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; says Hav@@ ard .
The drink can kill the smell .
I try a few pieces .
If you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , pover@@ ty-@@ stri@@ cken times in Norway when , pre-@@ refriger@@ ation , fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight bar@@ rel@@ s of water and salt in autumn .
Then in the dep@@ ths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses kno@@ cked out by alcohol - e@@ aten .
Only a generation ago , thousands of Norwe@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , em@@ ig@@ rating mainly to the US .
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by pl@@ enti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
People from Sweden , the old ri@@ val and not so long ago far rich@@ er than Norway , stream in to work .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ el@@ ly part of Norway &apos;s past .
It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
But then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sand@@ wich kno@@ ck you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
People here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the right-@@ wing , rac@@ ist extrem@@ ist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
Instead , the sho@@ ot@@ ings are referred to as &quot; the July the 2@@ 2nd incident . &quot;
Norwe@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their pe@@ ac@@ e-@@ lo@@ ving country one of their own was capable of such brut@@ ality and murder .
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world &apos;s biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway &apos;s present@@ -@@ day wealth .
&quot; But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , &quot; says Anna our wa@@ it@@ ress , hand@@ ing round tra@@ ys of mat@@ uring rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long bl@@ ond hair and star@@ t@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well-being .
We are a - how you say - pru@@ dent people .
Her English , like that of most people here , is fla@@ w@@ less .
We are not very show@@ y , we do not like ost@@ entation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
When everyone else was thro@@ wing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings tigh@@ tly bound .
&quot; As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy , &quot; says Anna .
&quot; And eat rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; she adds with a care@@ free lau@@ gh .
I stand in the snow and qu@@ eu@@ e for something to eat - I have had enough rak@@ fis@@ k .
Now an el@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather succ@@ ul@@ ent to the taste .
But in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ el@@ ly fish .
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rak@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish .
There is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rak@@ fis@@ k .
It is like the Euro@@ vision song contest .
&quot; What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or-@@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? &quot;
&quot; Here are our points , Hav@@ ard . &quot;
There is cla@@ pping , lau@@ ghter .
A man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it .
Or maybe it is the f@@ umes from all that fish .
Mexico &apos;s En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to faces tough start
As Mexico &apos;s incoming President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to pre@@ pa@@ res to take office , the BBC &apos;s Will Gran@@ t looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
Traff@@ ic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
A con@@ ge@@ sted city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been er@@ ected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
The aim , however , wasn &apos;t to stop comm@@ uters getting to work but prevent prote@@ sters from reaching parliament .
On Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
He faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the out@@ going administration of Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the gri@@ p of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60@@ ,000 lives in six years .
&quot; My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
Before rub@@ bing shoul@@ ders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to &apos;s previous political experience was as govern@@ or of his home state , the State of Mexico .
A popul@@ ous , spra@@ w@@ ling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old st@@ omp@@ ing ground .
A straightforward man
In the bu@@ co@@ lic town of Valle del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remembered f@@ ondly .
Re@@ sidents credit him with boo@@ sting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to &apos;s new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cra@@ cked and b@@ ump@@ y roads it replaced .
Pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
&quot; We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , &quot; says friend and political ally Gabri@@ el Ol@@ ver@@ a Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , a state con@@ gress@@ man for Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to &apos;s party , the PR@@ I .
Partic@@ ularly in terms of security and the economy , we &apos;re hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs .
After an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ou@@ sted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente Fox .
Con@@ gress@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a ad@@ mits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pin@@ os , there is much expec@@ tation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to .
And he re@@ jects the opposition &apos;s character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance .
He &apos;s a very straightforward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
He &apos;s an excellent stat@@ es@@ man and , above all , he &apos;s someone who knows how to listen .
But on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former govern@@ or .
In Ne@@ zah@@ u@@ alco@@ y@@ ot@@ l , also known as Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ za , the contrast with the co@@ bb@@ led streets of Valle del Bra@@ vo couldn &apos;t be shar@@ per .
Tu@@ cked away under motorway fl@@ y@@ over@@ s , it is in many ways a sub@@ ur@@ b of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the municipality are also g@@ rit@@ ty and urban .
Ear@@ lier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbour@@ hoods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
On a patch of wa@@ st@@ eland by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of doz@@ ens of murdered women have been dump@@ ed over the past two years alone .
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to was govern@@ or , a rate much higher than in the not@@ ori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place syn@@ onymous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to &apos;s critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ ici@@ de while he was in office .
At worst , they acc@@ use his administration of turning a blind eye .
In a concrete home typical of the run@@ down neighbourhood , Ir@@ ine@@ a Buen@@ dia stru@@ gg@@ les to fight back the te@@ ars as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una .
According to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
However her family believes she was murdered by her partner .
&quot; When I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been wash@@ ed , &quot; S@@ enor@@ a Buen@@ dia rec@@ alls .
There were signs she &apos;d been be@@ aten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
As her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice .
However , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
The state authorities have treated me like I &apos;m an old go@@ ssi@@ p , a troub@@ le-@@ maker , a wh@@ iner .
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and sh@@ uts up .
&quot; But that can &apos;t be right when there were so many irregularities and om@@ is@@ sions , &quot; she says .
As President P@@ ena Nie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
T@@ ens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
&quot; I hope he &apos;s the same kind of president as he was a govern@@ or , &quot; says PR@@ I Con@@ gress@@ man Ol@@ ver@@ a in Valle del Bra@@ vo .
That , however , is exactly what victims &apos; families in Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ za most fear .
Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing didn &apos;t compla@@ in about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , prosec@@ ut@@ ors con@@ tend
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors try to counter Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing &apos;s claims of abuse in con@@ fin@@ ement
The hearing focuses on Mann@@ ing &apos;s time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ inia
Def@@ ense wants case dis@@ missed on grounds that Mann@@ ing &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ement was harsh
The Army private is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing -- charged in the largest le@@ ak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to compla@@ in about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment he &apos;s alleg@@ ing he suffered in military cu@@ sto@@ dy .
While cross-@@ examining Mann@@ ing at a pre-@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ y@@ land , prosec@@ utor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asser@@ ted that records of weekly visits Mann@@ ing had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ inia , show no complaints about his treatment .
The cross-@@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Mann@@ ing &apos;s case dis@@ missed on grounds that his con@@ fin@@ ement has been harsh and has amoun@@ ted to enough punishment -- came a day after Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied that he had considered suicide while in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
The Army intelligence analy@@ st , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
The material was then published online by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
Wiki@@ Le@@ aks has never confirmed that Mann@@ ing was the source of its information .
In Friday &apos;s hearing , F@@ ein reviewed with Mann@@ ing the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Mann@@ ing during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico &apos;s bri@@ g , where he was held under a hei@@ gh@@ tened con@@ fin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
Offic@@ ers would ask Mann@@ ing questions and write down his responses .
When F@@ ein asked about the forms Friday , Mann@@ ing acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as &quot; excellent &quot; and treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional . &quot;
The forms show no complaints of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , even though the officers asked Mann@@ ing directly about his treatment , F@@ ein con@@ tended .
Mann@@ ing responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
&quot; They would write down &apos; no issues &apos; ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean I didn &apos;t bring something up , &quot; Mann@@ ing said .
The judge , Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise L@@ ind , also asked Mann@@ ing why he didn &apos;t compla@@ in about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suici@@ dal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
Mann@@ ing rep@@ lied that his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of injury &quot; status down@@ gra@@ ded .
The military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
&quot; I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my view@@ point , &quot; Mann@@ ing said .
Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ g@@ inia in July 2010 .
He said he con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated suicide in Ku@@ wait and once passed out there due to the heat .
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ res@@ sing .
&quot; My world just shr@@ ink to Camp Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that c@@ age , &quot; Mann@@ ing said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age .
Once at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Mann@@ ing said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
Mann@@ ing said he was allowed only a mat@@ tress , blan@@ ket , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps , some clothes and his gl@@ asses .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
Mann@@ ing said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
Mann@@ ing &apos;s lawyer filed a formal objec@@ tion to Mann@@ ing &apos;s treatment in January 2011 .
Mann@@ ing was moved to the military prison at Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , K@@ ans@@ as , in April 2011 .
Also Friday , the judge asked Mann@@ ing about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Thursday &apos;s testim@@ ony -- that after being forced to sleep n@@ aked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tico cell , he was forced to stand n@@ aked in front of guards and other in@@ m@@ ates during a morning head count .
Mann@@ ing had t@@ esti@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ ket during the head count .
Under ques@@ tioning from the judge Friday , Mann@@ ing said that he in@@ fer@@ red from his guard &apos;s order that he should drop a blan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied Thursday that he was forced to sleep n@@ aked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
Mann@@ ing said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ wear or his fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps to hur@@ t himself but ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t done so .
That night , Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied , his under@@ wear , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps and gl@@ asses were removed from his cell .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during con@@ fin@@ ement into account and shar@@ ply reduce his sentence should he be convi@@ cted at his cour@@ t-@@ mar@@ tial , which is expected to begin early next year .
The defense has said it plans to have Mann@@ ing ple@@ ad guilty to less@@ er off@@ enses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosec@@ ut@@ ors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warran@@ ted .
The Pent@@ ag@@ on has maintained that Mann@@ ing was held in accordance with rules governing all maxim@@ um-@@ cu@@ sto@@ dy de@@ tain@@ ees at Qu@@ an@@ tico .
Coun@@ ts against Mann@@ ing include ai@@ ding the enemy , wron@@ g@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mitting national defense information and the@@ ft of public property or records .
If he &apos;s convi@@ cted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
My Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ ic@@ ans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ ic@@ ans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ arre@@ tte says Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the conc@@ ourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got st@@ ump@@ ed .
Sign@@ s pointed the way to two lines : one for &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ os &quot; ( &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ ans &quot; ) , another for &quot; Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os &quot; ( &quot; Fore@@ ign@@ ers . &quot; )
I stood there for a few seconds , un@@ sure of where to go .
Gro@@ wing up in Central California , I had been called a &quot; Mexican &quot; my entire life .
It &apos;s ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends in New York describe themselves as &quot; Italian . &quot;
Later , I settled on &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ American . &quot;
But , this was Mexico .
And , in the hom@@ eland of my grand@@ father , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
But I don &apos;t have the voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of a native , and I can &apos;t sha@@ ke my American acc@@ ent .
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican pre@@ sident@@ -@@ elect En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
P@@ ena Nie@@ to was also e@@ ager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ ic@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Uni@@ on-@@ style trading blo@@ c in North America .
And P@@ ena Nie@@ to vo@@ wed to continue Mexico &apos;s war against the drug car@@ tels , even though he offered no specific@@ s .
For Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States inv@@ aded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of ri@@ f@@ le .
But for Mex@@ ic@@ ans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere .
So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexican press , and among the eli@@ tes -- complaints about how the Americans are en@@ cro@@ aching upon their neighb@@ or &apos;s sovereignty .
And the children of Monte@@ zu@@ ma go on the war@@ path .
And yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans living in the United States .
You want to talk about hard feelings ?
There is plenty .
Mexico has winners and lo@@ sers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn &apos;t .
The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancest@@ ry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoen@@ ix , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
And more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc .
We &apos;re their off@@ spring , and we &apos;re lo@@ yal to them .
Not Mexico .
And even though we may now be living the American Dre@@ am , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it &apos;s the American Dre@@ am we &apos;re living , and not the Mexican one .
Our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zz@@ y , but our loyalty is clear .
It &apos;s to the United States .
Besides , we &apos;re aware that many of the elite Mex@@ ic@@ ans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
The feeling is mutual .
They see us as a remin@@ der of a hum@@ ili@@ ating defeat and look down on us as in@@ fer@@ ior stock that isn &apos;t sufficiently Mexican .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
Our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
If our families ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t failed in Mexico , they w@@ ouldn &apos;t have left .
And we w@@ ouldn &apos;t now find ourselves tra@@ pped behind the sil@@ k cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but lost sou@@ ls nonetheless .
My wife , who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , remin@@ ds me that there is fri@@ ction between Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans because Mex@@ ic@@ ans have a fir@@ mer gra@@ sp of who they are and Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans res@@ ent that .
While she &apos;s a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
Meanwhile , many Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans I know don &apos;t feel like they &apos;re a part of either .
We love listening to the Mexican band , Los T@@ ig@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bru@@ ce Sp@@ ring@@ ste@@ en .
You get the best of both worlds , but you &apos;re rooted in neither .
In Mexico , we &apos;re seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we &apos;re considered Mexican .
Now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelli@@ gent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
They want to put Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans to work as ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft &quot; amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors &quot; for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
Y@@ e@@ ah .
That &apos;s not going to happen .
Too many hard feelings .
And , with income inequality and ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
That &apos;s fair .
If at least some Mex@@ ic@@ ans aren &apos;t yet ready to for@@ give the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mex@@ ic@@ an-@@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ mm@@ m .
Maybe we &apos;re more &quot; Mexican &quot; than I thought .
Old batt@@ les , new Middle East
The ceas@@ e@@ fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Ara@@ bs and Jews in the Middle East ?
Another round of bloo@@ d@@ shed suggests that any such hope is v@@ ain .
A@@ mid the usual fu@@ tile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rub@@ ble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missi@@ les from Gaza have land@@ ed near Tel Avi@@ v , Israel &apos;s metro@@ polis , and the hol@@ y city of Jerusalem .
But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional tur@@ mo@@ il .
Maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ di@@ er than before .
However , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their le@@ th@@ al stal@@ em@@ ate .
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sight , optim@@ ism looks very hard to justify now .
Even if the ceas@@ e@@ fire agreed on November 21st holds , this week &apos;s fighting has strengthened the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islam@@ ist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing .
Despite killing some of its leaders and bot@@ tling up Gaza &apos;s 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most w@@ ret@@ ched and crow@@ ded cor@@ ners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter ri@@ vals in Fat@@ ah , the more moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion .
Moreover , Hamas &apos;s leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
As Islam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained cl@@ out , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas &apos;s cause ; so has Q@@ atar , one of the rich@@ est and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
Jubil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islam@@ ist cre@@ sc@@ ent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the H@@ iz@@ bul@@ lah part@@ y-@@ cum@@ -@@ mili@@ tia holds s@@ way , through Syria , where reb@@ els of an increasingly Islam@@ ist b@@ ent may t@@ opp@@ le B@@ ash@@ ar As@@ sad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas &apos;s allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the king .
Above all , on Israel &apos;s southern flan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood under President Mu@@ ham@@ mad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most popul@@ ous and pi@@ vot@@ al of Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Ho@@ sn@@ i M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak , the secular des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
By contrast , the Bro@@ ther@@ hood is a cou@@ sin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
Meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard@@ lin@@ ers will draw the opposite conclusions .
In military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel &apos;s Ir@@ on D@@ ome anti-@@ missi@@ le system has proved its worth and many of Hamas &apos;s missi@@ les have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more sound@@ ly - for a while .
In diplomatic terms , America is as ste@@ ad@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also bl@@ amed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
Above all , Israel has prosp@@ ered , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
Although ro@@ ckets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suici@@ de-@@ bom@@ bers , thanks in part to the barrier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ un@@ k of a w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law .
Mr Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , whose Li@@ ku@@ d party has mer@@ ged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under Avi@@ g@@ dor Lie@@ ber@@ man in the run@@ -up to an election on January 2@@ 2nd , is sitting pretty .
Why co@@ ddle those twi@@ sty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
If they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire ro@@ ckets , just as their comp@@ atri@@ ots have done in Gaza ?
Better to keep them behind that wall and s@@ mit@@ e them if they raise their heads .
Maybe the hard@@ lin@@ ers will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
Even if the Islam@@ ists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
Starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies .
That the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceas@@ e@@ fire au@@ g@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to self-@@ determination is creating a powder ke@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus explo@@ ded in Tel Avi@@ v this week .
Re@@ pression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demo@@ graphy exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population s@@ well@@ s .
B@@ loo@@ dy missions against Gaza every few years to kno@@ ck back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
Both sides need pro@@ d@@ ding by out@@ si@@ ders
The answer remains the one tru@@ mp@@ eted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ce@@ ding territory for security .
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceas@@ e@@ fire will give a little more le@@ verage to out@@ si@@ ders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about st@@ opping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Q@@ atar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land sw@@ aps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab out@@ si@@ ders should also press Hamas and Fat@@ ah to come together .
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the im@@ min@@ ent bid for virtual stat@@ eh@@ ood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
During his first term , he negle@@ cted to present his own plan for peace .
Back in the White House , he is looking just as reluc@@ tant to be drawn in .
This is wo@@ efully short-@@ si@@ ghted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ tte plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
S@@ moking war@@ nings and dise@@ ased body parts emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned on dul@@ l green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia &apos;s world-@@ first laws on cigare@@ tte and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with generic dra@@ b olive green cover@@ ings , gru@@ es@@ ome pictures of dise@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and bab@@ ies made ill by their parents &apos; smoking .
Apart from the varying health war@@ nings and images the only difference between the p@@ acks , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small font .
It is the world &apos;s most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia &apos;s federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stri@@ pping the hab@@ it of gl@@ am@@ our .
It is rel@@ ying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
&quot; Even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their br@@ anding , &quot; said the federal health minister , T@@ any@@ a P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , c@@ iting studies that showed , for example , children linking a cro@@ wn in a logo with the idea of being a pr@@ inc@@ ess .
While Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multination@@ als &apos; profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
The tobacco industry lob@@ bi@@ ed hard against the laws .
Tob@@ acco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigare@@ ttes .
&quot; There will be serious un@@ intended consequences from the legislation , &quot; said Scott Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re of British American Tob@@ acco Australia .
Co@@ unter@@ fei@@ ters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
Others say the laws have boo@@ sted their business .
Sand@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Import P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigare@@ tte cases , si@@ lic@@ on covers to mask the un@@ pal@@ at@@ able packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tob@@ acco , Britain &apos;s Imperial Tob@@ acco , Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris and Japan Tob@@ acco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia &apos;s high court .
H@@ a said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6@@ ,000 to wholes@@ ale out@@ lets and was awaiting new stock .
This is good business for us .
The potential hit@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targe@@ ting .
After a series of Australian laws bann@@ ing TV advertising and sports spon@@ sor@@ ship and requiring most s@@ ellers to hide cigare@@ ttes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
&quot; If you are a tobacco mark@@ eter and you &apos;ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the comp@@ elling place for you to be in , &quot; said B@@ eck@@ y Fre@@ em@@ an , a public health resear@@ cher at Sydney University .
Fre@@ em@@ an noted an increase in &quot; average Jo@@ e &quot; reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
We have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigare@@ ttes and they &apos;ve gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tob@@ acco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Hon@@ dur@@ as and the Domin@@ ican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being un@@ fairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-@@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photogra@@ ph war@@ nings mandatory in 2001 .
They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Tou@@ gher laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many smo@@ kers in Australia remain de@@ fi@@ ant .
The pictures don &apos;t affect me .
I just ignore them .
&quot; You just gra@@ b a smoke and put it away , &quot; said Vic@@ tor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photogra@@ ph of a mouth tum@@ our .
Hon@@ est@@ ly , there &apos;s only one reason I &apos;d stop , and that &apos;s my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the Pack tob@@ ac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to st@@ ack his shel@@ ves
&quot; It used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , &quot; Y@@ u said .
&quot; The government should have just banned them altogether and then we &apos;d go OK , fine , we &apos;re done , we &apos;ll shut up shop , &quot; he said , thro@@ wing his hands up in the air .
In a Con@@ st@@ antly Plug@@ ge@@ d-@@ In World , It &apos;s Not All Bad to Be Bo@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom .
I won &apos;t lie to you .
Hal@@ f a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ di@@ ous , even with the di@@ stra@@ ctions of books , magazines and i@@ Ph@@ ones ( not to mention dut@@ y-@@ free shopping ) .
But increasingly , some academ@@ ics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom .
It &apos;s all right for us - and our children - to be bo@@ red on occasion , they say .
It forces the brain to go on interesting tan@@ g@@ ents , perhaps fo@@ stering creativity .
And because most of us are almost consistently plug@@ ged into one screen or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom .
So should we emb@@ race bo@@ re@@ dom ?
Yes .
And no .
But I &apos;ll get back to that .
First of all , like many people , I assumed that bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the adv@@ ent of more leisure time .
Not so , says Peter T@@ oo@@ h@@ ey , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary in Canada and the author of &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom : A Li@@ vely History &quot; ( Y@@ ale University Press , 2011 ) .
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , &quot; he said .
There &apos;s Latin gra@@ ff@@ iti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of P@@ omp@@ ei@@ i dating from the first century .
Then there &apos;s the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom .
The trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , an associ@@ ate professor of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ tari@@ o , Canada .
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of &quot; wanting to , but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activity . &quot;
What separ@@ ates bo@@ re@@ dom from ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
With ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
The core experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is &quot; dis@@ ruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
Bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an aw@@ ful lot like depression .
But Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bo@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed see the problem as themselves .
Sometimes we think we &apos;re bo@@ red when we just have difficulty concent@@ rating .
In their study , &quot; The Un@@ engaged M@@ ind : Defin@@ ing Bo@@ re@@ dom in Terms of At@@ tention , &quot; which appeared in the journ@@ al Per@@ spec@@ tives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
Some groups heard a loud and un@@ related television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely notic@@ eable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the sound@@ track at all .
The ones who heard the low-@@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concent@@ rating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to bo@@ re@@ dom .
When you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult or eng@@ aging task , dis@@ ruption of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associ@@ ate professor of neuro@@ science at the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph in On@@ tari@@ o and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something dul@@ l , &quot; such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line , di@@ stra@@ cting music can help you not be bo@@ red . &quot;
In fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physi@@ cally alert .
&quot; Research shows that kids who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , &quot; Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
We all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ ron@@ ing speaker , a particularly te@@ di@@ ous movie .
But some individuals are more likely to be bo@@ red than others .
To help measure this , researchers developed a &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom P@@ ron@@ eness Sc@@ ale &quot; in the 1980s .
The scale includes questions like , &quot; Many things I have to do are re@@ peti@@ tive and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous , &quot; and &quot; I have so many interests , I don &apos;t have time to do everything . &quot;
Using such sc@@ ales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bo@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ dan@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , a professor of psych@@ ology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes nee@@ ding more , and a variety of , external stim@@ ulation .
But in general , teen@@ agers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
In 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Il@@ lin@@ ois , conducted an experiment in which he cont@@ acted almost 400 teen@@ agers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ ep@@ er .
He found that 32 percent of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents said they were bo@@ red in school and doing home@@ work , while 23 percent said they were bo@@ red when they weren &apos;t in school .
On the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bo@@ red .
Professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom percent@@ ages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
But he said he did know that &quot; ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , &quot; largely because children and teen@@ agers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
So back to my original question : Is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ?
Sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gam@@ ble or indul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
On the other hand , many philosoph@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ dan@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said G@@ ary Mar@@ cus , a professor of psych@@ ology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U .
But the brain doesn &apos;t always know the most appropriate thing to do .
If you &apos;re bo@@ red and use that energy to play guitar and co@@ ok , it will make you happy .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is bo@@ red and you give him an i@@ Pad , he may not be bo@@ red anymore , but he has@@ n &apos;t learned how to enter@@ tain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
And &quot; that self-@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , &quot; he said .
Your k@@ id doesn &apos;t just learn to enter@@ tain himself , but gets more self-@@ control in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom .
Nor should we be too critical of it .
Rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chat@@ ter of activity and technology .
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed .
&quot; We frame it as we need to be bo@@ red more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an ag@@ on@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , &quot; he said .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time .
&quot; In an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimul@@ ated , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s hard to find ways to engage when the noise sh@@ uts down . &quot;
In Col@@ or@@ ado , No Play@@ book for New Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law
Anth@@ ony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co , 19 , a community college student and so@@ ccer player in sou@@ the@@ astern Col@@ or@@ ado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of mari@@ ju@@ ana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the pla@@ ins near the K@@ ans@@ as border , when they were pul@@ led over .
After the police officer found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car , Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a sum@@ mon@@ s for possession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - pet@@ ty off@@ enses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
&quot; We get treated like criminals , &quot; Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said .
But is he one ?
In the uncertain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ado &apos;s vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
H@@ und@@ reds of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or mari@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-@@ scale possession that will be legally sanc@@ tioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
But prosec@@ ut@@ ors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ado have vo@@ wed to press ahead with existing mari@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still c@@ iting people for possession .
At the same time , several towns from the Den@@ ver sub@@ ur@@ bs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state-@@ licensed retail mari@@ ju@@ ana shops from opening in their communities .
&quot; This thing is evol@@ ving so quickly that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen next , &quot; said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ ora , just east of Den@@ ver .
Regul@@ ators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec@@ . 1 , 2013 .
They say that Col@@ or@@ ado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ ju@@ ana , first for medical use and now recre@@ ation@@ ally .
&quot; Col@@ or@@ ado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , &quot; said Bri@@ an E. Smith , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board .
But no place or system , Mr. Smith conc@@ eded , can do more than suggest what might work .
&quot; There &apos;s no real precedent for us to follow , &quot; he said .
Washington &apos;s law , called I-@@ 50@@ 2 , takes effect on Dec@@ . 6 , which also leaves a year of lim@@ bo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
And there are thor@@ ny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state &apos;s mandate of &quot; adequate access &quot; to licensed mari@@ ju@@ ana with its prohi@@ bitions on cann@@ ab@@ is businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
&quot; No@@ where will it be more difficult to site a licensed cann@@ ab@@ is business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metro@@ politan area , &quot; said Ben Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Center for Legal Cann@@ ab@@ is , a recently formed research group .
On Nov@@ . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in A@@ ur@@ ora sent his officers an e-mail announ@@ cing that the city att@@ or@@ ney would no longer be prosec@@ uting small mari@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes &quot; effective immediately . &quot;
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical mari@@ ju@@ ana gro@@ wers , and that they would still pursue drug traffi@@ ckers and dealers .
In northern Col@@ or@@ ado &apos;s W@@ eld County , the district att@@ or@@ ney , K@@ en Bu@@ ck , represents a stricter view .
After the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing mari@@ ju@@ ana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
Right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two oun@@ ces or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana , though many are facing other charges .
&quot; Our office has an obligation to prosec@@ ute off@@ enses that were crimes at the time they occurred , &quot; Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement .
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a County , where voters rejected the mari@@ ju@@ ana initiative .
The police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the county &apos;s largest city , are no longer c@@ iting adults for possession of small amounts .
The county &apos;s district att@@ or@@ ney , Pe@@ te Hau@@ tz@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dis@@ miss all of the pending possession cases .
&quot; I do not think I &apos;m wa@@ sting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he said .
Although 55 percent of Col@@ or@@ ado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
And the contradi@@ ctory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ val@@ ence among local officials about the state &apos;s big green experiment .
&quot; It &apos;s a cultural barrier &quot; with district att@@ or@@ neys , said S@@ ean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a Den@@ ver lawyer who represents mari@@ ju@@ ana defen@@ dants and is a local spo@@ kes@@ man for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
&quot; They spent so much of their lives prosec@@ uting people that they still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
As the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana like alcohol , Col@@ or@@ ado and Washington are po@@ ised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
As advocates and state officials plan for a new fron@@ tier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anxi@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates for leg@@ alized mari@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Justice Department yiel@@ ds .
Despite some high-@@ profile arre@@ sts of medical mari@@ ju@@ ana patients and s@@ ellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in Col@@ or@@ ado , Washington and 16 other states .
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to sei@@ ze a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state-@@ regulated recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kev@@ in A. Sa@@ bet , a former drug policy adv@@ iser in the Obama administration .
Several cities in Col@@ or@@ ado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
Even before Ele@@ ction Day , some local governments approved mor@@ atori@@ ums on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
Last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six-@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , &quot; said Bo@@ b Nichol@@ son , a City Council member .
Our community voted against this amendment .
We &apos;re looking at what the community voted for ver@@ sus what the state voted for .
There &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ ella W@@ y@@ att : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a T@@ ory
It is not just today &apos;s university students who are attacked for their views
I can &apos;t remember a time when I didn &apos;t dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
Both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I ima@@ g@@ ined was the world &apos;s greatest seat of learning , a modern@@ -@@ day win@@ e-@@ b@@ lus@@ hed Greek sym@@ posi@@ um encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance .
Yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester College in the late Ei@@ gh@@ ties to read history , I &apos;d packed my bags , pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ating the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down and cri@@ ed .
Friends were ba@@ ff@@ led .
The E@@ ven@@ ing Standard di@@ ary claimed I &apos;d qu@@ it because I objec@@ ted to fellow under@@ gradu@@ ates having sex in the room next to mine .
The writer A N Wil@@ son announced wag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that I &apos;d depar@@ ted because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped mu@@ gs .
The truth was less dro@@ ll .
I ran away .
Yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bul@@ lying and intim@@ id@@ ation .
Not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persec@@ uted for one reason only , and in this cra@@ dle of supposed en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment it was both big@@ oted and bar@@ b@@ ari@@ c : my father , the late Woo@@ d@@ row W@@ y@@ att , was a high-@@ profile adv@@ iser to Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher and I was a Con@@ servative suppor@@ ter .
Why bring this up now , you might ask .
Well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Ri@@ ght-@@ of-@@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
Such is the institution@@ alised and increasing hat@@ red of T@@ ory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al-@@ rights protection as ga@@ ys , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
Con@@ servative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i College &apos;s junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are &quot; often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome &quot; because of their political views .
They want to create a post on the college &apos;s equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be ai@@ red freely .
Their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , W@@ onder@@ land : Young , B@@ right and on the Right , about student politics , which portra@@ yed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ balls and neo-@@ Naz@@ is .
It featured graduate Jo@@ e Coo@@ ke , former president of the Oxford University Con@@ servative Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , travelling in a Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce , sporting a silver suit and sil@@ ver-@@ t@@ opp@@ ed cane .
At other universities , Con@@ servative students say they are being treated as &quot; scap@@ e@@ go@@ ats &quot; for the introduction of higher tu@@ ition fees . &quot;
Lu@@ ke Black , 20 , vic@@ e-@@ president of Not@@ t@@ ingham University Con@@ servative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing Le@@ ft-@@ wing bi@@ as at universities .
People assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without meeting us . &quot;
Samu@@ el Rober@@ ts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is &quot; un@@ comfortable , &quot; while Steph@@ an@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
&quot; This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18-@@ year-old .
H@@ at@@ red of the Con@@ servative Party was at its most f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le .
The year before , the university had voted to refuse Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher - a former student - an hon@@ or@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
The atmosphere would have made a Stal@@ in@@ ist sh@@ u@@ d@@ der with ap@@ prehen@@ sion .
During the first few days of fresh@@ ers &quot; week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ un@@ ting of T@@ ory under@@ gradu@@ ates but took part with reli@@ sh .
The politics of the min@@ ers &quot; strike , priv@@ atisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against apar@@ thei@@ d South Africa were brought into the woo@@ d-@@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tut@@ orial .
My first one involved transl@@ ating 18@@ th-@@ century French texts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed .
&quot; Mis@@ s W@@ y@@ att , &quot; said the don , Harry Pit@@ t ( now dec@@ e@@ ased ) , &quot; please translate the first paragraph . &quot;
I st@@ umb@@ led over it .
A small man with a face like ca@@ ke bat@@ ter , Pit@@ t was big on bi@@ le .
&quot; Do Th@@ at@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stup@@ id ? &quot; he demanded .
The other under@@ gradu@@ ates gi@@ gg@@ led .
T@@ ears pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
&quot; I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you &apos;re not too busy soci@@ alising , &quot; Pit@@ t s@@ nar@@ led .
I wal@@ ked back to my rooms a dis@@ con@@ sol@@ ate figure .
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
It was a second-@@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he said kin@@ dly .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s like that .
Anyone suspec@@ ted of being a T@@ ory is picked on .
It &apos;s bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher , so it will be worse for you .
Most T@@ ory fresh@@ ers pre@@ tend they &apos;re Labour .
Later , at a local pu@@ b , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate .
I insi@@ sted that I didn &apos;t agree with everything Mrs Th@@ at@@ cher said .
This plo@@ y proved un@@ successful .
A first year PPE student , who , ir@@ on@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : &quot; You &apos;re the daughter of a fasc@@ ist pi@@ g . &quot;
You &apos;re contam@@ inated .
Other students took up the refra@@ in .
I was per@@ ver@@ ted , dirty .
&quot; How do T@@ ories have sex ? &quot; one asked .
They beat each other , don &apos;t they ?
I felt the way homo@@ sexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties .
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
Would I be forced to meet lik@@ e-@@ minded people only after dark ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and sup@@ press my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ?
The three years before me stret@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ stra@@ c@@ ism and isolation .
The only openly T@@ ory don was Nor@@ man St@@ one , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
He was h@@ ated for being not only a Con@@ servative but a foreign policy adv@@ iser to Th@@ at@@ cher and one of her speech writers .
He was hardly ever there .
He lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provin@@ cial and pet@@ ty , and for its adher@@ ence to the Mar@@ x@@ ist@@ -@@ determin@@ ist view of history .
In 1997 he took up a prof@@ ess@@ or@@ ship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; You won &apos;t be happy here , &quot; he told me .
I began comm@@ uting from Oxford to my parents &quot; house in London , finding refuge with my more open-@@ minded metro@@ politan friends and family .
I told my father I h@@ ated Oxford and why .
He was incre@@ dul@@ ous .
During his time there in the For@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
&quot; But it &apos;s the best place in the world , &quot; he said pa@@ the@@ tically .
They w@@ ouldn &apos;t do that , not among my dre@@ aming spi@@ res .
Even my Communist friends always had im@@ pec@@ cable man@@ ners .
His r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to clou@@ d .
Gi@@ ve it a chance .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s all just a te@@ ase .
It would break my heart if you left .
Ex@@ hau@@ sted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deterior@@ ating .
A male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory suppor@@ ter , had succ@@ um@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ ounced his cre@@ ed .
During a tut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seri@@ ousness , that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
In@@ war@@ dly b@@ lus@@ hing with shame , I admitted to being &quot; bra@@ in@@ wash@@ ed by my parents &quot; and called them &quot; old fo@@ ols . &quot;
The re@@ spite was short .
It was my father who dro@@ ve the nail into the co@@ ff@@ in of my Oxford career .
At the time , he wrote two columns in the Mur@@ doch press each week .
My door was locked .
I co@@ wer@@ ed inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
When they left , I packed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
You may call me a sni@@ v@@ elling wi@@ mp .
But no 18-@@ year-old should be subject to such intim@@ id@@ ation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill-@@ deser@@ ved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
&quot; Val@@ entino pre@@ fers elegance to not@@ ori@@ ety &quot;
On the occasion of the &quot; Val@@ entino : Master of Cou@@ ture , &quot; an exhibition that opened this week in London , AB@@ C speaks with Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , Fi@@ ona Thyssen@@ -B@@ orn@@ emis@@ za and other of the Italian designer &apos;s famous clients .
Som@@ er@@ set House , former home of Queen Eli@@ za@@ beth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Val@@ entino Gar@@ av@@ ani exhibition .
During the inau@@ gu@@ ration of &quot; Val@@ entino : Master of Cou@@ ture , &quot; the designer acknowledged a retro@@ spective a@@ pothe@@ o@@ sis that brings together over 130 cou@@ ture go@@ wns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
&quot; I love this palace &quot; he says , in his un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able Italian acc@@ ent .
This exhibition is the cul@@ min@@ ation of a story whose only pro@@ tagon@@ ist is &quot; sign@@ ore &quot; Gar@@ av@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients .
Val@@ entino has always been fascin@@ ated by the ra@@ re@@ fied and distant world of the no@@ bility .
In the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of ari@@ sto@@ cracy , from Princ@@ ess S@@ ali@@ ma@@ h A@@ ga Kh@@ an , Lord Snow@@ don , Princ@@ ess Mar@@ ie-@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al of Greece to Mar@@ gare@@ t of England .
Val@@ entino exhi@@ bits these personal memories as if they were trop@@ hi@@ es of his social as@@ cent from hum@@ ble cou@@ turi@@ er in Vo@@ gh@@ era , northern Italy , to i@@ do@@ l of the international jet@@ -@@ set .
There is nothing wrong with lo@@ ving ro@@ y@@ alty .
&quot; At least they don &apos;t drop cigare@@ tte ends on your magnificent car@@ pet , like some beautiful pop music celeb@@ ri@@ ties do , &quot; says Baroness Fi@@ ona Thyssen@@ -B@@ orn@@ emis@@ za .
In the &apos; 6@@ 0s and &apos; 7@@ 0s , we both lived in the Alps and were good friends .
Val@@ entino is a spectacular host whose enter@@ tains with gener@@ osity and elegance .
&quot; We all loved being invited to his chal@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad &quot; says &quot; Hein@@ i &quot; Thy@@ ssen &apos;s ex-@@ wife , a close friend of forgotten beau@@ ties such as Ma@@ rel@@ la A@@ gn@@ elli and Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ arch@@ os .
Val@@ entino has always preferred elegance to not@@ ori@@ ety .
And yet , he is a star .
Val@@ eria Maz@@ za , wearing a Val@@ entino .
The Argent@@ ine model Val@@ eria Maz@@ za also rec@@ alls the cou@@ turi@@ er &apos;s char@@ is@@ ma .
Many years ago , after a fashion show in Piazza di Sp@@ agna in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
There were twenty of us , including Sharon St@@ one and John Ken@@ ne@@ dy J@@ r .
You could see and feel his &quot; spirit &quot; in every detail of the flat and its decor , the food and the music .
&quot; All the guests were made to feel important and loved &quot; rec@@ alls the top model , who started working with him during Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture We@@ ek Paris , in 1995 .
&quot; His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion &quot; she concludes .
Nob@@ ility par@@ ade
Gar@@ av@@ ani &apos;s life is not a story of ob@@ session , but of well reciproc@@ ated love .
He lo@@ ves well-@@ educated people who come from good back@@ grounds , and they love him .
One of the Som@@ er@@ set House galleries has been transformed into a gl@@ amor@@ ous , six@@ ty-@@ foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role re@@ versal : visitors take the place of the models and have to par@@ ade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a dream &quot; audience &quot; wearing Val@@ entino master@@ pieces , for example , the dress Jack@@ ie Ken@@ ne@@ dy chose for her wedding with A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le On@@ as@@ sis , the cost@@ ume Mon@@ ica Vit@@ ti wor@@ e in &quot; La Not@@ te &quot; and the w@@ ool and leather coat that belon@@ ged to Em@@ press Far@@ ah Di@@ ba .
In this crowd of man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ b@@ illa of Luxembourg , Gl@@ oria von Th@@ ur@@ n und Ta@@ xis , Met@@ te-@@ Mar@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ ario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Hab@@ sburg .
Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Val@@ entino is like your first love , &quot; impossible to forget . &quot;
I remember it perfectly .
It was a pair of tro@@ users , a shirt , a &quot; gi@@ let &quot; wa@@ ist@@ coat and jack@@ et from the 197@@ 1-@@ 1972 aut@@ um@@ n-@@ winter collection .
&quot; It was a gift he gave me &quot; says Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the designer &apos;s m@@ uses .
&quot; I prefer him to other designers because of his femin@@ inity , his great love of women , and because he enhan@@ ces our beauty &quot; added the former Du@@ ch@@ ess of Feri@@ a .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and &quot; lend themselves &quot; to your face .
Their propor@@ tions are perfect .
The pr@@ inc@@ ess and fashion advis@@ or Patri@@ cia della Giov@@ amp@@ a@@ ola d &apos;@@ Ar@@ enberg also re@@ members the first time she wor@@ e a Val@@ entino .
As a teen@@ ager living in Italy , I dre@@ amed of reaching the age when I &apos;d have the chance to wear one of his evening go@@ wns ...
My time finally came in the late &apos; 9@@ 0s .
I bought my first Val@@ entino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cou@@ sin , Prince E@@ dou@@ ard de Lig@@ ne .
It was a red dress , with a fri@@ l@@ ly sk@@ ir@@ t , dra@@ ped &quot; cor@@ sage &quot; and a stra@@ pl@@ ess nec@@ k@@ line .
&quot; It was a dream come true &quot; says Princ@@ ess D &apos;@@ Ar@@ enberg , the wi@@ dow of Ro@@ dri@@ go d &apos;@@ Ar@@ enberg .
&quot; Val@@ entino is in@@ different to fashion , his ob@@ session is tim@@ eless &quot; says this Italian ari@@ sto@@ cra@@ t who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princ@@ ess D &apos;@@ Ar@@ enberg looks after her cou@@ turi@@ er go@@ wns with &quot; the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress , it &apos;s also the many memories that go with it . &quot;
The &quot; king &quot; of fashion
The &quot; grand fin@@ ale &quot; of the Som@@ er@@ set House exhibition is Mar@@ ie-@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al Mil@@ ler &apos;s wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 .
It took four months &apos; work and 25 &quot; girls &quot; ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stresses ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l-@@ en@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ vor@@ y-@@ coloured sil@@ k go@@ wn with twelve different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half metres long .
According to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion mile@@ stone of the late 20th century , &quot; the return of high society clients . &quot;
Da@@ zz@@ led for years with the &quot; sa@@ vo@@ ir@@ -@@ être &quot; of the elite , Val@@ entino is now its finest exp@@ on@@ ent .
Cav@@ ali@@ ere di Gran Cro@@ ce ( the high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking distinction in Italy ) , Cav@@ ali@@ ere del La@@ vor@@ o , Comm@@ an@@ de@@ ur de L &apos;@@ Or@@ dr@@ e des Arts et des Lett@@ res , and awarded the Legi@@ on of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ av@@ ani accum@@ ul@@ ates as many hon@@ ours as any of his clients &apos; hus@@ bands .
&quot; I &apos;ve always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his ne@@ at and perfect appearance &quot; acknowled@@ ges D &apos;@@ Ar@@ enberg .
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a g@@ ala dinner at the Or@@ say Museum .
He was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess J@@ acqu@@ eline de Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
&quot; He was imm@@ ac@@ ulate , time stands still for him . &quot;
If a pr@@ inc@@ ess says that ...
The har@@ dest job in the world : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en
For four euros , the Indone@@ sian volcan@@ o por@@ ters risk life and lim@@ b carrying 70 ki@@ los of sul@@ ph@@ ur along steep stone paths .
There are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell .
This is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ ja@@ ya , one of the 400 min@@ ers who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o , east of the Indone@@ sian island of Java .
To do so , he has to desc@@ end every day to the bottom of the cr@@ ater , where the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ rous gas eman@@ ating from the bo@@ wels of the earth solidi@@ fies on contact with air .
After breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ ur rocks , which in total can wei@@ gh up to 70 ki@@ los , he carries them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bas@@ k@@ ets on his shoul@@ ders along the steep stone paths .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcan@@ o , which rises to 2,@@ 3@@ 86 metres above sea level , but the exhau@@ sted por@@ ters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail &apos;s pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the pre@@ cip@@ ice .
They know that one sli@@ p could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who pl@@ ung@@ ed to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en cli@@ ffs .
The Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en min@@ ers are paid 5 euro c@@ ents for each kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photogra@@ ph them like cir@@ cus mon@@ keys and then , lug@@ ging their heavy bas@@ k@@ ets , they walk three kilometres to the sc@@ ales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,@@ 8@@ 50 metres above sea level .
This is PT N@@ gri@@ mb@@ i C@@ and@@ i , a company which , since 1960 , has been explo@@ iting the volcan@@ o , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro c@@ ents ) per kil@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur .
It then s@@ ells the sul@@ ph@@ ur for 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 c@@ ents ) to the pet@@ ro@@ chemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches , fire@@ works , cosme@@ tics , dynam@@ ite and even for wh@@ it@@ ening sugar .
&quot; We generally carry 70 ki@@ los , so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.@@ 8 euros ) a trip &quot; explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhau@@ sted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a pit@@ tance for such an in@@ human effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
&quot; Min@@ ers &apos; wages are very high here , whereas coffee harv@@ esting is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 16@@ 7 euros ) &quot; explains the porter , who previously worked as a mas@@ on in the island resort of Bali .
There , his wage was 7@@ 5,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to Ban@@ y@@ u@@ wan@@ gi , a village near the volcan@@ o , for a comp@@ elling reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ riding as the sul@@ ph@@ ur : &quot; I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hin@@ du , and I &apos;ve brought her to Java to convert to Islam . &quot;
An@@ to has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty brea@@ thing , cou@@ ghs constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gases .
At 27 years old , An@@ to has been ris@@ king his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o , and the sul@@ ph@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and go@@ gg@@ les .
He has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty brea@@ thing , cou@@ ghs constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gases from the volcan@@ o .
This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams .
&quot; I &apos;ll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French &quot; he vo@@ ws in more than acceptable English .
Pun@@ ished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ iter or hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le .
Shar@@ ing a fil@@ thy wooden h@@ ut with other por@@ ters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ ph@@ ur doesn &apos;t stop f@@ lowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it g@@ lows in the dark .
De@@ fying the sha@@ dows , An@@ to desc@@ ends the cr@@ ater and lights the path with a small tor@@ ch attached to the hel@@ met he bought with his money .
Some 400 por@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ ur bas@@ k@@ ets on their shoul@@ ders from the cr@@ ater .
Despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sul@@ ph@@ ur extra@@ ction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the por@@ ters , who work for themselves and by the kil@@ o .
In fact , they do not even see any of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 2.5 euro ) per camera sur@@ charge that , on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photogra@@ ph the volcan@@ o and their human mul@@ es .
&quot; This work is for animals , not people &quot; protests Mad@@ ru@@ sin , a bur@@ ly 4@@ 2-@@ year porter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en for three decades , since leaving school .
He can lift up to 110 ki@@ los , ensuring that he will go on working &quot; all he can &quot; because he needs the money to educ@@ ate his three children , aged between 18 &#91; months ? &#93; and 10 years old .
I won &apos;t reti@@ re , I &apos;ll die here because the volcan@@ o has been my whole life .
Although the sul@@ ph@@ ur bur@@ ns your thro@@ at and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and tra@@ ps the min@@ ers in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcan@@ o , they are so har@@ dy that no-@@ one compla@@ ins of serious ill@@ nesses ... apart , of course , from their common re@@ spir@@ atory problems , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ thri@@ tis , kne@@ e pain and so@@ res on the shoul@@ ders , which have been mis@@ sha@@ pen by the weight of the bas@@ k@@ ets .
Bal@@ an@@ cing the bas@@ ket on his back , Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k can only carry 50 ki@@ los now he is 53 years old .
Every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sul@@ ph@@ ur from the volcan@@ o , which three lor@@ ries move to the ware@@ house in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilometres away along a go@@ at path that passes through sc@@ rub@@ land .
&quot; I won &apos;t reti@@ re , I &apos;ll die here because the volcan@@ o has been my whole life &quot; says Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
The oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sul@@ ph@@ ur .
Time passes , but poverty perpet@@ u@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o .
Singapore seeks bab@@ ies to save its economy
Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans blame their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
&quot; Singapore &apos;s population needs to grow . &quot;
I &apos;m a patri@@ o@@ tic husband , you &apos;re my patri@@ o@@ tic wife , let &apos;s do our civi@@ c duty and create life !
It may seem unlikely that these ver@@ ses are part of an adver@@ t for min@@ t swe@@ ets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went vi@@ ral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
The phra@@ ses are part of a ra@@ p and make use of local references such as &quot; Let &apos;s put a ba@@ o ( bu@@ n ) in the oven &quot; to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is hop@@ e@@ ful that the adverti@@ sement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , Dou@@ glas Ham@@ il@@ ton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their &quot; national duty . &quot;
It &apos;s purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and am@@ using .
It &apos;s the biggest problem facing this country .
We are the world &apos;s worst at re@@ producing our own pro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching perf@@ umes with pher@@ om@@ ones or organising speed dating evenings .
Many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn &apos;t necessarily work .
So we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by com@@ posing a ra@@ p ?
1.2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so ligh@@ tly .
It sp@@ ends USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
A government package for marri@@ ages and parents grants up to USD 15@@ ,000 per child , extends mat@@ ernity leave and distri@@ butes tax benefits .
But this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Sou@@ theast Asia , also known for the con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans not having children ?
T@@ an We@@ i M@@ ing , Director of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Family Policy of the National Pop@@ ulation Division , said that it is a result of &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family &quot; he explains .
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and dela@@ ying marriage and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created res@@ ent@@ ment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly dis@@ gu@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Incre@@ ased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and le@@ vies for foreign workers .
U@@ ne@@ x@@ pec@@ ted consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore &apos;s case there are also some unexpected consequences .
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
For example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as &quot; shoe boxes , &quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city .
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may promote a single-@@ living lifestyle and discou@@ rage developers who want to build large family houses .
But , L@@ im Y@@ e@@ w So@@ on , managing director of the real estate company EL Develop@@ ers , says his &quot; shoe boxes &quot; sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
This means they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he ad@@ mits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
&quot; People are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family &quot; says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
&quot; But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time &quot; says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike mention their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
So , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to bab@@ ies , the Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans have the last word .
What is private offline is private online
Privacy .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy D@@ ic@@ tionary , it means the quality of private life or &quot; the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . &quot;
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by air@@ ing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline ?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ dic@@ o inter@@ viewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
In four cases , they associated the term with &quot; something very much mine &quot; on a personal level , and &quot; in the user name and password &quot; when applied to social networks .
&quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t upload my deep@@ est secre@@ ts in a post &quot; says Jor@@ ge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hot@@ mail and Windows Live Messenger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
&quot; They are very secret secre@@ ts , I &apos;ll tell my mother , but not everybody &quot; he says .
On F@@ B I upload nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know .
&quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t share a photo that isn &apos;t mine , or that belongs to somebody who &apos;s doing something stup@@ id &quot; he says .
The child recognises that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pictures of n@@ aked people , crimes , or write hum@@ ili@@ ating or aggressive comments .
Jor@@ ge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine fol@@ lo@@ wers on Twitter .
Most are relatives .
His mother is included , and she has the password to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting t@@ we@@ ets .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if they answer me , I only upload them &quot; he adds .
&quot; Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends &quot; he says .
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stran@@ ger to him .
The case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
This teen@@ ager has accounts with Hot@@ mail , Facebook , My Space and As@@ k , and in the last case he ad@@ mits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
&quot; It doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me , because we have something in common , like music &quot; he says .
The boy says that no-@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
&quot; If they pres@@ su@@ red me or asked me for it , I &apos;d just delete them from my account &quot; he states .
Joseph became a fol@@ lower on As@@ k , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
This teen@@ ager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ lying .
An acqu@@ ain@@ tance of a friend of mine was being p@@ est@@ ered on a social network .
They were threatening him and demanding money from him .
&quot; I never found out who it was &quot; he says .
The victim , according to José , did not close his account .
&quot; He just made it private . &quot;
He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely .
Unlike Jor@@ ge , this boy would upload photos of acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces in un@@ comfortable or embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ing situations .
I would do it if I didn &apos;t like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
&quot; However , I know that &apos;s cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ lying &quot; he ad@@ mits .
Key questions
Mari@@ el@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teen@@ agers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
&quot; The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed &quot; he says .
Por@@ ras says the schol@@ ar Marc Pr@@ ens@@ ky , with a Master &apos;s degree in Education from Y@@ ale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Imm@@ igrants , co@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
Digital n@@ atives are those children and young people born with technology .
&quot; We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning &quot; he says .
He says that the issue is complex , &quot; because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to dis@@ close , publish or di@@ vul@@ ge , at an age at which mat@@ urity is not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to this . &quot;
&quot; They also have to be selec@@ tive when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences &quot; he adds .
According to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teen@@ agers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
&quot; T@@ elling them not to do it is no good &quot; he adds .
Por@@ ras then lists some options : There are things you w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell a stran@@ ger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
Do you know what others publish about you ?
When tag@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people &apos;s permission to tag them ?
And one more question : does everyone need to know what you &apos;re doing all the time ?
Another point is to make them see that they must be@@ have online as they do offline .
The rules are the same .
&quot; Out@@ side the Internet , people act with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks &quot; he says .
Monitoring
Stu@@ art Gu@@ ard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consul@@ tant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks &apos; policies thoroughly .
By understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
&quot; For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish &quot; he says .
According to Guar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the &quot; don &apos;t talk to stran@@ gers &quot; lesson .
Un@@ as@@ ur Summit clo@@ ses without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration
The Six@@ th Presiden@@ tial Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration , previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven atten@@ de@@ e leaders .
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Six@@ th UN@@ AS@@ UR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presiden@@ tial and Chancell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peru@@ vian Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been dis@@ closed by Peru@@ vian President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
Journ@@ alists &apos; access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was ai@@ red , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message &quot; closed session , audio restricted . &quot;
The little information that circul@@ ated among re@@ por@@ ters was given by the press spo@@ kes@@ men of some of the UN@@ AS@@ UR governments attending the meeting , but not the Peru@@ vian Government .
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending pre@@ sidents , which an@@ gered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Peru@@ vian President then sent an email to the media with the &quot; final statement &quot; of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala &apos;s statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South Americ@@ an-@@ Arab Countries ( AS@@ PA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lim@@ a Declaration was again not made public .
The AS@@ PA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both international events , the Peru@@ vian authorities were at pa@@ ins to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum .
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , Sebas@@ ti@@ án Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the law@@ suit Lim@@ a has filed against Santiago .
&quot; We will o@@ bey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court &quot; said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chi@@ lean counter@@ part .
&quot; Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts &quot; added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , gre@@ eting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ sha@@ ke , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Con@@ fir@@ mation of both pre@@ sidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week den@@ ounced the Bo@@ got@@ á Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the jud@@ gement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime bound@@ ary with Nicar@@ agua which it regarded as seriously fla@@ wed .
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez ; Boli@@ via , E@@ vo Mor@@ ales ; and Argentina , Crist@@ ina Kir@@ chner .
Parag@@ u@@ ay , which was suspended by UN@@ AS@@ UR in 2011 after the dis@@ miss@@ al of former President Fern@@ ando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
Ho@@ st President Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lim@@ a .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ AS@@ UR countries will take &quot; important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . &quot;
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve &quot; cooperation in the fight against in@@ security and transnational organised crime , actions to make medic@@ ation more accessible , low-@@ cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . &quot;
With Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a tri@@ ump@@ ha@@ list attitude but should serve to expand its productive mat@@ rix and gli@@ mp@@ se a better future for its people &quot; Hum@@ ala added .
&quot; We decided to focus on a group of 31 flag@@ ship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... un@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks &quot; said the Peru@@ vian President in a message read out .
Among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse a@@ xes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecu@@ ador , although he gave no further details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Parag@@ u@@ ay .
&quot; We hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , &quot; from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbour@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counter@@ part from Nicar@@ agua , Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga , on Saturday in Mexico , to respec@@ t@@ fully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , ques@@ tioned by Bo@@ got@@ a .
&quot; The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga &quot; San@@ tos said .
&quot; We will review all these paths , &#91; which &#93; are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicar@@ agua will require a conversation with Nicar@@ agua &quot; he emphasised .
&quot; With President Or@@ te@@ ga , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civili@@ sed and respec@@ tful manner possible &quot; said San@@ tos .
San@@ tos and Or@@ te@@ ga are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inau@@ gu@@ ration of the country &apos;s new President , En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ña Nie@@ to .
Also , as part of the summit , the blo@@ c &apos;s foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Boli@@ via , Colombia , Ecu@@ ador , Peru , Brazil , Urugu@@ ay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ in@@ am and Parag@@ u@@ ay make up UN@@ AS@@ UR , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional blo@@ c .
&quot; South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship &quot; says Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea
The President of Ecu@@ ador , Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot; South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . &quot;
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the Elev@@ enth Presiden@@ tial Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) held in Lim@@ a , told Peru &apos;s state television that Europeans &quot; killed one another in the Second World War &quot; and other conflicts , &quot; but are now practically one country . &quot;
To this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UN@@ AS@@ UR .
&quot; We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the An@@ de@@ an Community . However , there are still re@@ ac@@ tionary sectors that want us to return to the past &quot; he said .
The Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the pre@@ mise of reducing the influence of the An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything .
&quot; It is in@@ comprehensible that the Inter@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding &quot; he said referring to Ecu@@ ador giving political asylum to Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange .
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betra@@ yed his principles , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
He added that , at the time , &quot; he had reasonable suspi@@ cion that Ass@@ ange would be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to another country and that his case would not be respected . &quot;
Additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to ques@@ tioning for an alleged sexual off@@ ence in his country , when &quot; Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be ques@@ tioned via vide@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Emb@@ assy in London . &quot;
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterioration of Ass@@ ange &apos;s physical and mental health .
&quot; I have not spoken to him since he was at our emb@@ assy , but the amb@@ assador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious &quot; said the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deterior@@ ate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
&quot; That would complic@@ ate the health of any person &quot; he added .
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange in June by the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Emb@@ assy , in London , through the issue of a saf@@ e-@@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecu@@ ador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the im@@ prison@@ ment of the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder .
We do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
&quot; The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Ass@@ ange &apos;s lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ zon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts &quot; he said .
And he felt that &quot; if Britain says no to the saf@@ e-@@ conduct pass , it &apos;s over . &quot;
And if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Ass@@ ange at the Emb@@ assy of Ecu@@ ador in London , or inter@@ ro@@ gates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reas@@ sert himself as a def@@ ender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not toler@@ ate is &quot; the medi@@ o@@ cri@@ ty , dish@@ on@@ est@@ y and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wick@@ ed politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and ex@@ tor@@ tion &quot; he said .
In that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , &quot; or the ban@@ kers or bour@@ geo@@ is and he@@ gemon@@ ic countries that domin@@ ate Ecu@@ ador &quot; and said that , if re-@@ elected , he will &quot; step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . &quot;
Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Parag@@ u@@ ay in UN@@ AS@@ UR , at least until their next elections , argu@@ ing that the body &quot; must be firm and not toler@@ ate opport@@ un@@ ism and a coup mas@@ ked with leg@@ ality &quot; because this will in fact &quot; destroy the legitimacy of Parag@@ u@@ ay@@ an democracy . &quot;
The Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President also considered the &quot; perfectly per@@ tin@@ ent &quot; desire of his Colom@@ bian counter@@ part , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , to now negotiate with Nicar@@ agua the maritime bound@@ ary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nicar@@ agu@@ an maritime sovereignty .
For now that ruling is not being followed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
Additionally , he tru@@ sted in a sound conclusion to the maritime bound@@ ary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that &quot; it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . &quot;
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecu@@ ador seeking a third consec@@ utive term , he said he sees that possibility &quot; with much optim@@ ism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . &quot;
Cor@@ rea said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will reti@@ re from public life .
Person@@ ally , I &apos;ve never been interested in power , but in situations as un@@ just as those in Ecu@@ ador , socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
&quot; My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that prob@@ able victory , so we have to accept that responsibility &quot; he said .
If I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
If I lose , likewise .
&quot; It &apos;s a decision &quot; he confirmed .
Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezu@@ el@@ an President Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez &apos;s new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezu@@ el@@ an Vice President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Cha@@ vez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
&quot; This does not mean a health rela@@ pse for President Cha@@ vez &quot; he said .
In Lim@@ a today , the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Head of State attended the Six@@ th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
De@@ a@@ ths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
Fabri@@ zio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
&quot; It was like a bomb dropped on me &quot; he says , rec@@ alling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make &quot; so@@ fter , &quot; apparently un@@ successfully .
The boy hi@@ d it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 4@@ 3rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Civil Hospital ( CH@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several batt@@ les with his health .
Fabri@@ zio has lived with the human imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of sti@@ g@@ ma .
Then , even the director of an IM@@ SS &#91; Mexican Social Security Institute &#93; clin@@ ic refused to discharge him &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
At that time , having A@@ ids was syn@@ onymous with death .
Now it is possible to survive the syn@@ dro@@ me and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are still un@@ aware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused ha@@ vo@@ c , &quot; exhau@@ sted &quot; their immune systems and they are suffering from opport@@ un@@ istic infec@@ tions .
31 years after of the on@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , &quot; the great achievement at this time is that the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of the general population is exactly equal &quot; stated the head of the CH@@ G HIV Unit , J@@ aim@@ e An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journ@@ al .
In@@ fec@@ tious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expec@@ tan@@ cy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed , with a higher life expec@@ tan@@ cy for non-@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
In simple terms , this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and &quot; as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 &quot; said the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e .
To gau@@ ge this progress , it should be remembered that the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy of Mex@@ ic@@ ans today is 76 years .
Although mor@@ tali@@ ty has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the adv@@ ent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
In J@@ ali@@ sco alone , only 25@@ 5 people died in 2011 , and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That &apos;s how I view it , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we &apos;ve had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are un@@ aware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
He gave a comp@@ elling stati@@ stic : &quot; N@@ ine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opport@@ un@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mor@@ tali@@ ty is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . &quot;
Speci@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Pre@@ vention in J@@ ali@@ sco ( CO@@ ES@@ ID@@ A ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabri@@ zio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered K@@ apos@@ i sar@@ com@@ a , a can@@ cer@@ ous tum@@ our that is one of the common complic@@ ations .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people think they &apos;re going to die and don &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; If I &apos;m going to die , I &apos;d rather have a b@@ low-@@ out three times a week &quot; they say , but not in my case .
The change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
&quot; I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person &quot; said Fabri@@ zio , who agreed to share his intimate secre@@ ts with M@@ IL@@ EN@@ IO J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
They should get tested if they are at risk@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagno@@ sed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his message , which sum@@ mar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Con@@ d@@ oms behind the counter .
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ az@@ ar , a journalist from Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause .
And the greatest cure is prevention .
In places dedicated to this task &quot; the distribution of con@@ d@@ oms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pack@@ ets of a hundred , and that &apos;s fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ d@@ oms &quot; he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are teen@@ agers .
&quot; Why do you want them ? &quot; is a common question , asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors , pharm@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to ex@@ pose teen@@ agers to sex , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such in@@ efficient allocation , and that con@@ d@@ oms should not only be placed behind counters , but that pack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public toilet disp@@ en@@ sers in places frequ@@ ented by young people .
This is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity .
It is not about paying for their be@@ ers or mo@@ tel fees , as Govern@@ or Em@@ ili@@ o Gonz@@ al@@ ez said , when asked if there would be distribution of con@@ d@@ oms during his administration .
&quot; And it &apos;s not about sexu@@ ality , but it is best to provide con@@ d@@ oms to those already practi@@ sing sexual activity &quot; he said .
J@@ ali@@ sco key points
There are 13@@ ,@@ 4@@ 35 cum@@ ul@@ ative cases ( 12@@ ,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,@@ 3@@ 17 HIV ) .
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cum@@ ul@@ ative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infec@@ tions are through sex , 6 % via the bloo@@ d@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ at@@ al .
An estimated 50@@ ,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4-@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive .
Rati@@ fied by a United States court of appeal , a jud@@ gement which igno@@ res the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Group &apos;s debt achieved via a bank@@ rupt@@ cy in Mexico , the scenario is an om@@ in@@ ous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solven@@ cy problems .
It seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stri@@ pes , contrary to international conventions .
In practical terms , the endor@@ sement of the jud@@ gement delivered on 15 June by Ju@@ dge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mexican firms defen@@ cel@@ ess against possible sei@@ z@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three in@@ consisten@@ cies .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that credi@@ tors should be governed by the United States Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Code , the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the Fif@@ th Cir@@ cu@@ it , based in New Or@@ le@@ ans , states that the main action is the in@@ solven@@ cy action handled in Mexico .
The first point would involve ignor@@ ing international procedural cooperation in cases of in@@ solven@@ cy of companies with transnational profiles .
Indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ formity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitr@@ ator .
Secondly , the jud@@ gement establishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the in@@ solven@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
However , Mexican law recognises the possibility .
In fact , the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
There are half a do@@ zen examples , including Agre@@ me@@ x and Commer@@ cial Mex@@ ic@@ ana , whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vit@@ ro credi@@ tors who fought against it in the US courts , namely &quot; vul@@ ture &quot; funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os Capital , Au@@ reli@@ os Conver@@ gence , El@@ li@@ ot International and Li@@ ver@@ pool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was apparently 45 percent ver@@ sus 37 .
This data is om@@ it@@ ted by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al .
From another perspective , the latter bl@@ ames Vit@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the Gonz@@ al@@ ez S@@ ada family firm has lo@@ dged a motion for re@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
Should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed .
The real problem is that the court b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of am@@ ic@@ us curi@@ ae ( &quot; friend of the Court &quot; ) , which details the procedure followed by Vit@@ ro under the framework of the Commer@@ cial In@@ solven@@ cy Law , no@@ ting that the latter disch@@ ar@@ ged itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Act of the United States .
Moreover , it should be noted that the country yiel@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross-border in@@ solven@@ cy cases , ensuring fair@@ ness for deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors .
Double wh@@ am@@ my : Vit@@ ro hit and country hit .
Balance She@@ et
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ ic@@ ana Airlines against the former owner of the company , Gast@@ ón Az@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de , who is accused of mis@@ management , dor@@ man@@ t for several months , the Air@@ line Pi@@ lots Union Association already found the bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck .
The proceedings headed by Carlos Di@@ az Cha@@ vez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Sec@@ urities Commission , which is accused of ob@@ struc@@ ting justice .
The claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Att@@ or@@ ney General &apos;s Office on a transaction carried out by the emplo@@ yer to remove 19@@ 8 million p@@ es@@ os from trust F / 5@@ 89 of Ban@@ co I@@ X@@ E , on behalf of Mex@@ ic@@ ana de Avi@@ ación .
The resources were apparently chann@@ elled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administ@@ ra@@ dor@@ a Pro@@ fe@@ sional de Hotel@@ es .
As you know , Az@@ car@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de is the main share@@ holder of the Po@@ sa@@ das hotel chain .
Op@@ posing Dra@@ gon Mar@@ t
A group of local and foreign environment@@ alists , academ@@ ics , business@@ men and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dra@@ gon Mar@@ t in Can@@ cu@@ n .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
Pre@@ viously , Can@@ ac@@ in@@ tra had managed to unite the govern@@ ors of the sou@@ theast of Mexico to oppose the monum@@ ental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
The death of AC@@ TA
The Government ignored an order of the Sen@@ ate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Amb@@ assador in Japan signed the Anti-@@ Co@@ unter@@ fei@@ ting Trade Agreement , known by its ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m AC@@ TA , according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been archi@@ ved .
As you know , the action was taken even though the Sen@@ ate had ruled out the possibility , de@@ em@@ ing it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks .

H@@ ec@@ tor &quot; He@@ tin &quot; Re@@ yes : &quot; Bas@@ ketball has been my life &quot;
Bas@@ ketball glo@@ betro@@ tter H@@ ec@@ tor &quot; He@@ tin &quot; Re@@ yes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , trav@@ elled the world .
Fe@@ w people in Puerto R@@ ico have a mental rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ction of local bas@@ ketball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor &quot; He@@ tin &quot; Re@@ yes .
Re@@ yes was immer@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a whe@@ el@@ chair in 2008 following a stro@@ ke ; he was a minor le@@ ague player , National Superior Bas@@ ketball player , BS@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os or President of the Bas@@ ketball Federation .
&quot; I wor@@ e lots of h@@ ats in bas@@ ketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the BS@@ N , general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Team during the &apos; 9@@ 0s , &quot; rec@@ alled Re@@ yes during Pri@@ mer@@ a Hor@@ a &apos;s visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with Isa@@ bel , his lo@@ yal wife for over 50 years .
&quot; Bas@@ ketball has been my life . &quot;

The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memor@@ abili@@ a den@@ oting his long career , which goes to prove it .

Of them all , the ones he treas@@ ures with the most emo@@ tion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os , from the mid-@@ 50@@ s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co-@@ agent or agent of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; Those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os &apos; eight champ@@ ion@@ ships , since 1967 , either as agent , co-@@ agent or manager .
There were many good years , including the five consec@@ utive champ@@ ion@@ ships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said good@@ by@@ e with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome M@@ inc@@ y &apos;s de@@ but year in the BS@@ N .
Then &quot; Cu@@ co &quot; Or@@ tiz took over - he was a great manager &quot; said Re@@ yes .
I remember that Gen@@ e Bar@@ to@@ w , who had directed here and was at the University of Al@@ ab@@ ama ( Birmingham ) , said to me &apos; I &apos;ve got a very strong player for you , 6 &apos; 7 &quot; t@@ all .
Do you want him ? &apos;
And that was the beginning of M@@ inc@@ y , one of the best players Puerto R@@ ico ever had .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the shar@@ p@@ sho@@ oter G@@ aus@@ se Ra@@ y@@ mond , who established re@@ sidency here and was one of our best sh@@ oo@@ ters .
I remember him saying that if M@@ inc@@ y had given Bay@@ am@@ on one champ@@ ionship , G@@ aus@@ se would help get another .
The V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os &apos; champ@@ ionship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ shot .
For that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ inc@@ y &apos;s accompli@@ sh@@ ments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre@@ -@@ Olymp@@ ics in Mexico .
Then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bron@@ ze , but for the Canadian refer@@ ee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Re@@ yes .
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you &apos;ve ever seen ?
It &apos;s one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dre@@ am Team in the 2004 Olymp@@ ics .
However , my favourite was the one in the 1991 P@@ an American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a be@@ ating , which was quite similar to the time we won bron@@ ze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included M@@ inc@@ y , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ vas , F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z and &apos; P@@ icul@@ ín &apos; ( Or@@ tiz ) , but also the young ( J@@ avier ) &apos; To@@ ñ@@ ito &apos; Col@@ ón and James Car@@ ter , the Le@@ on brothers ( Francisco and Ed@@ gar ) and Mario &apos; Qui@@ jo@@ te &apos; Mor@@ ales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a kne@@ e injury .
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold me@@ dal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre@@ -@@ Olympic team in Neu@@ qu@@ en , Argentina .
With role players such as &apos; Can@@ ito &apos; Nie@@ ves , P@@ ab@@ lo Alic@@ ea and the young Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ iner replacing the players suspended after the sh@@ amb@@ les of the Mar del Plat@@ a Pan@@ -@@ American Games , we won gold against all the od@@ ds .
Who was the best Puerto R@@ ican player ?
Without any doubt , P@@ icul@@ ín Or@@ tiz .
His numbers at international tournament level are a@@ wes@@ ome .
N@@ obo@@ dy in Puerto R@@ ico has dominated at that level like P@@ icul@@ ín did .
Not to mention his career in the various le@@ ag@@ ues he played in .
Who was the best Puerto R@@ ican manager ?
That &apos;s a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Ju@@ lio Tor@@ o , Fl@@ or Mel@@ ende@@ z , Carlos Mor@@ ales , Ra@@ y@@ mond Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ di@@ to Tor@@ res .
Of the young@@ sters , I really like the work of Le@@ o Ari@@ ll .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
Having been part of the National Team &apos;s most gl@@ orious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 9@@ 0s the BS@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you to do ?
There were things I &apos;d have liked to implement , such as region@@ alising the minor le@@ ag@@ ues .
For example , the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national play@@ off@@ s .
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much , un@@ necessarily .
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ ees .
That ple@@ ases me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grand@@ children and occasionally go to bas@@ ketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Eli@@ za@@ beth , who has always been with me .
Ac@@ tor Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man dies
Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , born on 21 September 19@@ 31 in Fort Wor@@ th ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ro@@ ss E@@ wing , better known as &quot; J@@ R , &quot; in the television series &quot; D@@ allas , &quot; in which he played a ru@@ th@@ less , mali@@ cious and manipul@@ ative business@@ man .
Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , whose role as oil ty@@ co@@ on pre@@ dat@@ or J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series &quot; D@@ allas &quot; became a symbol of gre@@ ed in the 1980s , has died .
He was 81 .
H@@ ag@@ man , who returned this year as J@@ R in a new season of &quot; D@@ allas , &quot; died on Friday afternoon of cancer complic@@ ations , according to a family statement provided to the Associ@@ ated Press by the War@@ ner Bro@@ s. , producer of &quot; D@@ allas . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ ry was back in his bel@@ o@@ ved hom@@ et@@ own of D@@ allas , once again representing the i@@ con@@ ic role he most liked &quot; the family said .
Lar@@ ry &apos;s family and closest friends were with him in D@@ allas for the Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving Day holiday .
Lin@@ da Gra@@ y , who played his wife in the original series and the sequ@@ el , was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital in D@@ allas , said her public@@ ist , J@@ eff@@ rey Lan@@ e .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , generous , fun@@ ny , lo@@ ving and tal@@ ented , and I will miss him de@@ arly .
&quot; He was an original guy and lived life to the full &quot; said Gra@@ y in a statement .
H@@ ag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver in 1992 and admitted that he had dr@@ un@@ k a lot over the years .
In 1995 a mali@@ gn@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his li@@ ver and he under@@ went a transp@@ l@@ ant .
Y@@ ears before &quot; D@@ allas , &quot; H@@ ag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light com@@ edy &quot; I Dre@@ am of Je@@ ann@@ ie , &quot; ai@@ red on N@@ BC from 1965 to 1970 .
He played Captain Tony N@@ elson , an a@@ stron@@ aut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Bar@@ bara Eden , and takes her home to live with him .
He also star@@ red in two sit@@ com@@ s that were not ai@@ red for long , &quot; The Good Life &quot; ( N@@ BC , 197@@ 1-@@ 72 ) and &quot; Here We Go Again &quot; ( AB@@ C , 1973 ) .
His film work included roles well received by critics in &quot; The Group , &quot; &quot; Harry and T@@ onto &quot; and &quot; Pri@@ mary Col@@ ors . &quot;
But it was his master@@ ful interpretation of deli@@ ght@@ fully dete@@ stable J@@ R that led to H@@ ag@@ man reaching his peak of star@@ dom .
The drama series on C@@ BS about the E@@ wing cl@@ an and other characters in their or@@ bit ai@@ red from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The tag@@ line &quot; Who shot J@@ R ? , &quot; designed to generate h@@ ype around an episode full of emotions in which H@@ ag@@ man &apos;s character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of ris@@ ky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming establishments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million vie@@ wers tun@@ ed in and made &quot; D@@ allas &quot; the second most wat@@ ched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of &quot; MAS@@ H &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million vie@@ wers .
It was J@@ R &apos;s si@@ ster@@ -in-@@ law Kris@@ tin ( played by Mary Cro@@ s@@ by ) who shot him .
J@@ R got her pregn@@ ant then threatened to say she was a pro@@ stitute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
H@@ ag@@ man portra@@ yed E@@ wing as a corrupt ins@@ ati@@ able man with a char@@ ism@@ atic s@@ mile : a dish@@ on@@ est entrepren@@ eur and che@@ ating husband who tried to have his alcoholi@@ c wife , Su@@ e El@@ len ( Lin@@ da Gra@@ y ) , sec@@ tioned .
&quot; I know what I want on J@@ R &apos;s tom@@ b@@ stone &quot; H@@ ag@@ man said in 1988 .
It should read : &quot; Here lies the honest citizen J@@ R E@@ wing . &quot;
This is the only deal he lost .
Victoria Princip@@ al , co-@@ star of the original series , rec@@ alled H@@ ag@@ man on Friday as someone &quot; huge , on and off screen . &quot;
He is unforgettable and ir@@ replac@@ eable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
Ten ep@@ iso@@ des of the new edition of &quot; D@@ allas &quot; were broadcast a few months ago with great success for T@@ NT .
He had already finished recording five ep@@ iso@@ des for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after , there was no statement from War@@ ner or T@@ NT about how the series would handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man .
H@@ ag@@ man , born in Fort Wor@@ th , Texas , was the son of ac@@ tress and singer Mary Martin , who star@@ red in classi@@ cs such as &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter P@@ an . &quot;
Martin was still a teen@@ ager when she had him in 19@@ 31 during her marriage to lawyer Ben H@@ ag@@ man .
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early &apos; 50@@ s , and later served in the Air Force from 195@@ 2 to 1956 , in England .
While there , he met the young Swedish designer Ma@@ j A@@ x@@ els@@ son and married her .
The couple had two sons , Pre@@ ston and Hei@@ di , and lived for a long time in the Califor@@ ni@@ an city M@@ ali@@ b@@ u , home to many celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
In 2001 , he called his mem@@ o@@ irs &quot; H@@ ello Dar@@ lin &apos; : T@@ all ( and Ab@@ sol@@ utely Tru@@ e ) T@@ ales About My Life . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t put anything in it that I believed would hur@@ t anyone or affect them in any way &quot; he told Associ@@ ated Press at the time .
After his li@@ ver transp@@ l@@ ant , he became an organ donation promot@@ er and worked as a volunte@@ er at a hospital , helping f@@ ear@@ ful patients .
&quot; I advise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards &quot; he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid , it will be a little un@@ comfortable for a short time , but then you &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
He was also an anti-@@ smoking activ@@ ist and took part in several campaigns .
Start of a course that explo@@ res the &quot; End of the World &quot;
Each week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ bies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
This term , when Professor of religion , Stu@@ art Char@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a comp@@ elling ho@@ ok : The end of the &quot; long coun@@ t@@ down &quot; of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
But Char@@ m@@ é had no idea what awa@@ ited him over the next couple of months : The cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sm@@ ic hur@@ ri@@ cane Sand@@ y , a fiscal pre@@ cip@@ ice some called &quot; debt Ar@@ ma@@ ge@@ d@@ don &quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end-@@ of-the-@@ world Christians the@@ or@@ ists think the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se will begin .
&quot; I didn &apos;t realise this was going to be the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic term ever &quot; said Char@@ m@@ é this week to students at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s-@@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jer@@ sey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good for those with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ment@@ ality .
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; this term , theore@@ tically the last in history .
At Temple , Associ@@ ate Professor Bar@@ ry V@@ ack@@ er is giving the course &quot; Media , Culture and the end of the world . &quot;
Each week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ om@@ bies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
&quot; We looked at why these ideas pro@@ lifer@@ ate over time &quot; he said , and how they offer hy@@ pothe@@ tical scenarios that guide human behaviour .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
This month students analy@@ sed movies with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic theme and explo@@ red how they compare with real-@@ life examples .
&quot; I &apos;ve tried to inform students about what is possible , prob@@ able , credible and impossible &quot; said V@@ ack@@ er .
At the main P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania State University camp@@ us , Latin American History Professor Mat@@ the@@ w Rest@@ all , and his colleague Am@@ ara Sol@@ ari , an Associ@@ ate Art History and Anth@@ rop@@ ology Professor , have te@@ amed up to give a course , called simply &quot; The end of the world . &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t add &apos; 2012 &apos; so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn &apos;t come to an end &quot; said Rest@@ all .
Despite the &quot; im@@ pending do@@ om , &quot; students have to study , undertake projects and take final exam@@ s .
At P@@ enn State , the final ex@@ am will be taken on the eve of the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work &quot; until the very night the world is supposed to end &quot; said Rest@@ all .
The courses proved quite popular .
&quot; It was fully booked within two hours &quot; said Rest@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students .
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
Stu@@ dents , mean@@ while , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
&quot; I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves &quot; said Bri@@ d@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ inson , a 23@@ -@@ year-old post-@@ graduate Religion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ ad@@ don@@ field , New Jer@@ sey , at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s-@@ Cam@@ den .
And the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic , secular or religious ment@@ ality is just a matter con@@ sol@@ ation or a lack of it .
Will We@@ kes@@ a , a 25-@@ year-old post-@@ graduate Psych@@ ology and N@@ ur@@ sing student , said he had seen all the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic movies .
&quot; I &apos;d never heard of a class that could teach it &quot; he said .
I enjoy it .
But none of the students inter@@ viewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
&quot; Our first project was about the May@@ an pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y and to a certain extent we dis@@ credited it &quot; said Ju@@ lie Z@@ eg@@ len , a 2@@ 1-@@ year-old final year student at Temple , from West Ch@@ ester .
The May@@ ans never predic@@ ted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Rest@@ all .
But he said that Western culture suff@@ ers from apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic anxi@@ ety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predic@@ ting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a boom in these specul@@ ations .
&quot; In other places , people don &apos;t think about it &quot; he said .
It &apos;s mostly in the Engli@@ sh-@@ speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ gh@@ er@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ alle University , who is giving courses in the Philipp@@ ines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; there .
&quot; The Philipp@@ ines are not taking part in the end of the world &quot; he wrote , sugge@@ sting an exception of a higher authority .
We have an indul@@ gence from the P@@ ope .
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last jud@@ gement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , &quot; people will immediately start thinking of the next date &quot; or philosoph@@ ising that December 21st is the beginning of a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year period after which the world will end .
Stu@@ dents and teachers are taking the date ligh@@ tly .
Some said they plan to go to &quot; end of the world &quot; parties .
&quot; Maybe I &apos;ll call some friends so we can have a lau@@ gh together &quot; said Sam@@ ira Ford , 20-@@ year-old communications student .
Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Fre@@ eing Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko
Today , the Ukraine parliament dis@@ missed , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to re@@ vo@@ ke an article based on which the opposition leader , Y@@ uli@@ a Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , was sent@@ enced .
The amendment that would lead to fre@@ eing the im@@ pris@@ oned former Prime Minister was re@@ vo@@ ked during second reading of the proposal for mitig@@ ation of sentences for economic offences .
In October , Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko was sent@@ enced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvanta@@ geous gas deal with Russia .
The verdi@@ ct is not yet final ; the court will hear Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko &apos;s appeal in December .
Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko claims the verdi@@ ct is a political re@@ ven@@ ge of the regime ; in the West , the trial has also e@@ vo@@ ked suspi@@ cion of being bi@@ ased .
The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sent@@ enced , was supported by 14@@ 7 members of parliament .
Its ratification would require 2@@ 26 votes .
Libya &apos;s Vic@@ tory
The story of Libya &apos;s liber@@ ation , or re@@ bel@@ lion , already has its defe@@ ated .
Mu@@ amm@@ ar K@@ ad@@ da@@ fi is bu@@ ried at an unknown place in the desert . Without him , the war is over .
It is time to define the winners .
As a rule , Islam@@ ists win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
The transitional cab@@ inet declared itself a fol@@ lower of the custom@@ ary Sh@@ aria law , of which we have already heard .
Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for ste@@ aling is having one &apos;s hand amp@@ ut@@ ated .
Women can forget about eman@@ cip@@ ation ; potential religious ren@@ eg@@ ades will be executed ; etc .
Instead of a dict@@ ator , a society consisting of competing tri@@ bes will be united by Kor@@ an .
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
However , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .
In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic figh@@ ters accepted help from the non@@ belie@@ vers .
Their only excuse is that from their point of view , NATO ra@@ ids were not controlled by an American general , but Allah , the great@@ ness of whom they celebrated with each strike .
When winners are sought for in Libya , the West is not on the list .
We participated in a shooting , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a dict@@ ator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq , we decided against military occupation of Libya .
The locals thus do not have to worry about exp@@ elling of the &quot; crus@@ aders . &quot;
Without the occupation , will the oil companies get Libya &apos;s black gold for next to nothing , though ?
It is quite likely that they will not . The West will then finally be able to bo@@ ast about its sel@@ fl@@ ess protection of human rights .
Unless the fol@@ lo@@ wers of the Sh@@ aria law put a stop to that .
New Er@@ a of Cri@@ sis Comm@@ ences
France and the rest of Europe are now in the investors &quot; spot@@ light .
A statistical storm ble@@ w over Europe on Tuesday .
Individu@@ al countries released their 3@@ Q GDP data .
Between quarters , the Czech economy stag@@ n@@ ated ; Germany and France are growing .
Yet the deb@@ it market is breaking records today .
Invest@@ ors are no longer looking at only Italy ; they now focus on Spain , France , Austria , and others .
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany , Czech Republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
Germany &apos;s GDP has grown by the expected 0.5 % ; and France &apos;s by 0.@@ 4 % .
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where Germany did better than expected ( a 0.@@ 3 % increase instead of the original 0.@@ 1 % ) . France reported a slight decrease , by 0.@@ 1 % ( the original information suggested stag@@ nation ) .
In this year &apos;s third quarter , the Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % .
Between the quarters though , the GDP stag@@ n@@ ated . According to the Czech Statisti@@ cal Office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual s@@ lowing of economic growth .
The results are worse than estimates by an@@ alyst@@ s .
Key events :
In this year &apos;s third quarter , Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % ; however , it stag@@ n@@ ated between the quarters .
Based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the German economy grew by 0.5 % .
Between July and September , the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew , compared to the previous quarter , by 0.@@ 2 % , which corresponds with estimates by an@@ alyst@@ s .
The Greek economy showed an interim decrease of 5.@@ 2 % .
The earnings on its 10-@@ year bonds are 28@@ .@@ 45 % .
Ear@@ nings of both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits .
Even Austria , Netherlands , France , and Belgium , etc. are beginning to experience problems .
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , earnings of Czech 1 - year bonds stay under 4 % .
Vo@@ ices are coming from Germany , sugge@@ sting that ECB be the last resort credi@@ tor .
Cze@@ chs qualified for EURO .
In Montenegro they won 1 : 0 and celebrate a 200 million wind@@ fall .
Foot@@ ball representation successfully managed the tou@@ gh@@ est task of the season !
Thanks to both the great Č@@ ech and beautiful goal of Pet@@ r J@@ ir@@ á@@ č@@ ek , they won 1 : 0 .
In the second half , Czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the European Championship .
I@@ H@@ NE@@ D.@@ cz wat@@ ched the progress match in a detailed report .
N@@ early no exc@@ itement in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
Czech representation team , partially due to the home team &apos;s failure in the close ; the great Č@@ ech ; and hero@@ ic J@@ ir@@ á@@ č@@ ek ; won 1 : 0 in Montenegro , and celeb@@ rates moving on to the European Championship .
Perfect Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
Dam@@ j@@ ano@@ vic and V@@ u@@ cin@@ ic became the match &apos;s least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities .
The wonderful Pet@@ r Č@@ ech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year &apos;s European Championship . And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Cro@@ wns .
From the opening minutes , the game was very pu@@ gn@@ acious .
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid-@@ field line most of the time .
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . Long ki@@ cks behind the defence were ne@@ at@@ ly aver@@ ted by the Czech defence .
Iranian Stu@@ dents Are Pre@@ p@@ ared to Die for Their Country &apos;s Nuclear Program
They created a live shi@@ eld .
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran .
The gest@@ ure is to express their support of their country &apos;s nuclear program against a possible Israel attack .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; pra@@ yers in front of the building were followed by their chan@@ ting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an U@@ ran@@ ium Con@@ version Fac@@ ility .
This way , they express their read@@ iness to protect their country &apos;s nuclear program with their own lives .
In its recent report , the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency ( IA@@ EA ) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped stri@@ ving for a nuclear weapon .
Po@@ s@@ sible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; pra@@ yers in front of the entrance into Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an U@@ ran@@ ium Con@@ version Fac@@ ility were followed by their chan@@ ting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible par@@ aly@@ sation of the Iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on Israel press , the facilities in both Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an and Nat@@ anz , where the ur@@ anium is being enrich@@ ed .
An O@@ bes@@ e Child &apos;s D@@ iet : No breakfast and s@@ aus@@ age for dinner
Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are over@@ weight ; while 9 % of school@@ children are over@@ weight , 5 % are o@@ bes@@ e .
As a recent research shows , o@@ bes@@ e children usually come from families with un@@ healthy lifestyle .
Again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
For example , s@@ aus@@ ages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of o@@ bes@@ e children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
Over 19 % of o@@ bes@@ e children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called O@@ be@@ sity is No Ac@@ ci@@ dent .
Moreover , the families of o@@ bes@@ e children do not prac@@ tise sports . However , this concerns a majority of families of current school@@ children - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
The research was performed among 900 children .
The research took place at the end of last year &apos;s school year ; it included almost 900 elem@@ entary school children from throughout Boh@@ em@@ ia .
It was the second year of the O@@ be@@ sity is No Ac@@ ci@@ dent event supported by both V@@ š@@ e@@ o@@ bec@@ n@@ á z@@ dra@@ vot@@ n@@ í po@@ ji@@ š@@ ť@@ ov@@ na insurance company and Uni@@ le@@ ver .
So far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades .
Prop@@ er diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either over@@ weight or o@@ bes@@ e .
&quot; For example , only half of those in@@ qui@@ red said they have five meals a day , in the break@@ fast@@ -@@ sn@@ ack@@ -@@ lun@@ ch-@@ sn@@ ack@@ -@@ dinner pattern , one of the basic pre@@ conditions of correct diet , &quot; one of the results of the research says .
No lunch and s@@ aus@@ age in the evening
Exper@@ ts war@@ n that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .
In the Czech Republic , only 23 % of school@@ children &apos;s families have breakfast together .
In a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .
The worst discovery was the fact that in one tent@@ h of households people do not have breakfast at all .
Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet .
A survey has shown that fri@@ es are consum@@ ed more often in the families of o@@ bes@@ e children .
N@@ early everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day ( 70 % ) .
Though over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number drop@@ s down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
Com@@ pose your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 20@@ 4 boys and 17@@ 2 girls from 13 schools ) to com@@ pose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
&quot; D@@ iet preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet . &quot;
Their favourite meals include large number of fl@@ our , meat , and sweet dishes .
&quot; Especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , &quot; the final report of the survey concludes .
As the main dish for lunch , past@@ a won very tigh@@ tly over p@@ oul@@ try .
However , children showed very little interest in leg@@ umes , fish , and vegetable lun@@ ches .
Tenden@@ cy towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating hab@@ its provided they are given correct information .
&quot; Many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a question@@ n@@ aire after the end of the O@@ be@@ sity is No Ac@@ ci@@ dent educational lec@@ ture , &quot; project results show .
This was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would begin to prefer plain water .
In addition , for their main course , children ti@@ cked p@@ oul@@ try and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and dum@@ pl@@ ings .
A Sty@@ list M@@ ust Also Be a Good Psych@@ ologist , Profession@@ als Cla@@ im
In the opening article on sty@@ list training , I was compla@@ ining a bit about the amount of information in the introduc@@ tory lessons .
I had no idea what was coming .
L@@ ec@@ tures by three experts from the field ; dres@@ sing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in prac@@ tise .
And more is yet to come .
The closer we get to the final ex@@ am , the more information and practical tasks await .
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday , but it is really packed with information .
This time , together with Al@@ en@@ ka , the Director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect sy@@ mm@@ etry .
A majority of women are not perfectly sy@@ mm@@ etri@@ cal .
One has a short neck , the other has a boy@@ ish figure without proper cur@@ ves , yet another is over@@ weight .
A sty@@ list must know how to op@@ tically so@@ ften wide shoul@@ ders , make the neck look longer , or add the cur@@ ves necessary .
We were given tips on how to acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ate the figure of women such as J@@ enni@@ fer L@@ op@@ ez , i.e. with bigger bre@@ asts and hi@@ ps and narrow wa@@ ist , and not to dress them too pro@@ voc@@ atively .
For example , if the difference between the wa@@ ist and hi@@ ps is such that the sk@@ ir@@ t or tro@@ users do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom@@ -@@ made .
You will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are pri@@ cel@@ ess .
In a custom@@ -@@ made sk@@ ir@@ t , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shi@@ fting , rolling up , sti@@ cking out in your wa@@ ist , etc .
Bo@@ y@@ ish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ru@@ ff@@ ling , appli@@ qu@@ é , em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y , or shi@@ r@@ ring .
Given the abund@@ ance of such information and figure types , I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
Still , I fear it is too much , with regard to the home@@ work we were given .
Each of the course participants was given a celeb@@ ri@@ ty to create two out@@ fits for : day and night .
We must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
I am to dress Mir@@ anda Ker@@ r whom you may know from the Victoria &apos;s Secre@@ t campaigns .
In@@ side I re@@ jo@@ ice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars , Christ@@ ina A@@ guil@@ era , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand I am exagger@@ ating ) , or the very young Sel@@ ena Gom@@ ez .
We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphi@@ cally process them .
Moo@@ d@@ board , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depic@@ tion .
It is important to think about the graphic part of sty@@ ling .
A sty@@ list does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy pur@@ ses , co@@ ats , etc . ) .
This is what a sty@@ list and designer , Mario Kam@@ en@@ í@@ k , was telling us about .
But that was not until Sunday .
A sty@@ list needs general knowledge
Saturday &apos;s lec@@ ture , filled with information on figure types , was li@@ ven@@ ed up by three guests from the field .
A sty@@ list , Hon@@ za Po@@ kor@@ n@@ ý ; a fashion designer , J@@ aku@@ b Pol@@ an@@ ka ; and a fashion photographer , Ben Ren@@ č .
J@@ aku@@ b reminded us that fashion is an illu@@ sion , and a sty@@ list should be able to use this fact .
A good sty@@ list can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
In this case , vari@@ ability is key .
For example , a tren@@ ch coat may be worn in the standard way , over je@@ ans and T-@@ shirt , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on n@@ aked body , with step@@ -@@ ins , as a dress .
Another option is rolling up the sle@@ e@@ ves or col@@ l@@ ar , and the entire look changes completely .
&quot; Play with it , &quot; he emphasised .
However , I appreciated the following advice the most : &quot; For your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . &quot;
&apos;@@ Then you can start breaking them , &apos; J@@ aku@@ b told us .
Here I finally understood why we dri@@ ll all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
Not to mention fashion shows .
From Ben , the photographer , I learned that a sty@@ list must have more out@@ fit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
So , for a ten-@@ page fashion story ( equ@@ als ten out@@ fits ) , I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
Now I also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an out@@ fit .
Hon@@ za Po@@ kor@@ n@@ ý confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
Just look at Mad@@ onna , who is no mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
The attitude towards sty@@ list services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic .
Even famous people often consider it redundant ( belie@@ ving it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
And if someone finally lets us create their sty@@ ling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
Then , we are left to Google and find out if the tab@@ lo@@ ids wrote something about a celeb@@ ri@@ ty gaining / losing weight , etc .
On Sunday , both Hon@@ za and Mario were stres@@ sing the fact that for a sty@@ list it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an out@@ fit .
Our work chie@@ fly consists of communic@@ ating with people we dress ; it is therefore important to be a good psych@@ ologist .
To be able to estimate people , not to p@@ ander , and stick to one &apos;s opinion .
&quot; If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire war@@ dro@@ be telling her how aw@@ ful the clothes are . &quot;
&quot; Find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with &quot; Mario says .
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
That is the bag you fa@@ sten around your wa@@ ist to carry all the pro@@ ps you need .
A@@ side from the obvious things , such as sc@@ iss@@ ors , a sti@@ cky ro@@ ller , or safety p@@ ins , it should have a n@@ yl@@ on thread ( for the sty@@ list to use when taking pictures of products such as pur@@ ses or h@@ ats ) , special cli@@ p-@@ ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( p@@ ins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a se@@ wing set .
To have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly under@@ lay shoe sol@@ es .
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the sol@@ es might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
And so we were sti@@ cking away .
You must not touch the shoes with the sc@@ iss@@ ors , to avoid any damage .
This requires real skill .
Mario pleased me by pra@@ ising my job .
The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea .
This is just a frag@@ ment of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional sty@@ list is no piece of ca@@ ke , no matter what people say .
V Ne@@ ed for Speed : The R@@ un takes place across America .
Review
An originally care@@ free ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous and slo@@ ppy mistakes .
The ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
Before it was released , the new version sub@@ ti@@ tled The R@@ un created high expectations .
It promised to shift the old Ne@@ ed For Speed racing series in a new direction ; the demo@@ s made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing gen@@ re .
We were curi@@ ous to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
Typ@@ ical for the N@@ FS series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
The game represents a possibly decent arc@@ ade race , but the whole is bur@@ dened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .
This means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an in@@ comprehensible la@@ zin@@ ess of the developers .
The adventure opens very well .
You are introduced into a story , where the main character , Jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America .
You get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach New York .
The idea brings several interesting features .
The route is divided into ten stages , sub@@ divided into over fif@@ ty races .
This means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
Still , it is nothing world-@@ sh@@ at@@ tering .
Dri@@ ving through the desert , aut@@ um@@ n@@ al countryside , or high in sno@@ w-@@ covered mountains is vis@@ ually very pleasant though .
In addition , the races are , from time to time , en@@ li@@ ven@@ ed by an un@@ typical feature .
For example , in the desert , you get into a sand@@ storm , significantly decre@@ asing the visibility .
On the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an av@@ al@@ anche .
Individu@@ al races are ordered fairly well .
There are just a few types , but it is sufficient .
For a while , you try to over@@ take a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard st@@ op@@ watch race ) ; or you are in a du@@ el with a single ri@@ val .
On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .
The parts outside the car are new .
They are just interactive anim@@ ations , where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time .
Nothing difficult .
It is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect ( just three to be precise ) .
It actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be bor@@ ing ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more enter@@ taining .
The driving model follows the foot@@ steps of the previous parts .
This means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
If you are looking for a real-@@ to-@@ life simulation , you will have to look elsewhere .
Still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .
So far , everything is just right .
However , after some time , problems come .
In contrast with the driving model , the col@@ li@@ sion model is not that good .
From a game of this type , one does not expect complicated de@@ form@@ ations and col@@ li@@ sions , but when you have no idea , before cra@@ shing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
Typ@@ ically , when over@@ taking or passing cars tigh@@ tly in common traffic , you sometimes ligh@@ tly touch the other car . Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
Or , cra@@ shed completely .
This is not such a big deal due to the re@@ start system , but is enough to spo@@ il the fun .
The re@@ starts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
Nevertheless , there are only five re@@ starts available per each race .
If you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
This makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
Sometimes the re@@ starts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
A significant short@@ coming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .
For example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later .
This is especially anno@@ ying in situations where you can see how your ri@@ val drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
It makes no difference when you get to them ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose .
The competitors have other advantages , too .
While playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same competi@@ tor over@@ takes you at the very same spot .
This is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
Obviously , your ri@@ val has to get in front of you no matter what .
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .
One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in-@@ filled , but it is so obvious it gets anno@@ ying quickly .
It &apos;s a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is enter@@ taining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
It is not important whether the reason you do not get bo@@ red is the concept with fif@@ ty unique tracks , ordering of races , or something else .
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual .
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .
Car@@ s are divided into three categories .
Sports cars are suitable for cities ; strong American cars for straight highway sections ; and exotic super@@ sports cars for technical driving , such as along cro@@ oked mountain tracks .
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
Here , you gain both me@@ d@@ als and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
Various features un@@ lock fi@@ r getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile back@@ grounds .
Again , the profile is inter@@ connected with an on-line Aut@@ olo@@ g function , which , among other things , comp@@ ares the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
Yet another set@@ back difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .
You and your car get into a subway tunnel ( let &apos;s say you do ) , where you speed down the tracks in the dark@@ ness ( let &apos;s say you do ) .
Your spe@@ ed@@ ometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( let &apos;s say it does ) , when suddenly , a subway train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pi@@ le of scra@@ p metal .
For several days , our edi@@ torial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such mor@@ ons .
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
It is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather tra@@ gi@@ cally , decre@@ ases .
This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where flu@@ ent reco@@ ding would not help you much anyway .
The sound is all right ; the sound@@ track is a matter of taste .
In order to please the wi@@ dest possible young audience , the sound@@ track is &apos; fle@@ cked in from all quarters &apos; ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
Overall impression of Ne@@ ed for Speed : The R@@ un is quite confused .
If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that The R@@ un is the best part of N@@ FS for the past several years .
However , the game feels un@@ finished .
It surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be blin@@ ded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spot@@ lights .

EU Amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á :
Cze@@ chs have the reputation of being negative and euro@@ -@@ scep@@ tical
&quot; Lisbon Treaty caused significant im@@ balance between individual institutions . &quot;
&quot; I did not expect it to be such a tough war . &quot;
&quot; It will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , &quot; EU Amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress Mil@@ ena Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á opened her lec@@ ture at the Law Department shar@@ ply .
She proved how true she is to her &quot; Clearly and openly about Europe &quot; motto in the very first part of her lec@@ ture , where she described individual EU organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intel@@ ligi@@ ble , way that many lec@@ tur@@ ers from the UK Law Dep@@ t@@ . could be je@@ alous .
Moreover , Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á pra@@ ised the work of new long-term President of the European Council , Herman Van Romp@@ u@@ y :
&quot; At first , critics said he was plain , a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles ; I have to say everyone was amaz@@ ed at how wonder@@ fully he acqu@@ it@@ ted his role . &quot;
&quot; He is a person who can listen to all twenty-@@ seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the EU should be headed . &quot;
She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : &quot; Who is the European Union ? Which phone number should I call ? &quot; ; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union &apos;s policy towards countries such as China or India .
No One W@@ ants To B@@ an Our Che@@ ese Speci@@ alties
Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past , present , and near future .
She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success .
Cze@@ chs were dealing with the coming financial crisis ; they solved the as crisis ; and organised the East Partnership Summit .
She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic .
Currently , Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy .
As the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stir@@ ring .
In addition , a new se@@ ven@@ -@@ year EU budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .
Whether the budget will be sli@@ m and fru@@ gal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
The amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress reminded the key slo@@ gans she took to Brussels : &quot; About Europe , Clearly . &quot;
&quot; I really do not like all the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , foreign words , and jar@@ gon no one understands .
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels , people are not trying to come up with cro@@ oked or round cu@@ cum@@ bers , different size ban@@ anas , or that someone wants to ban our cheese speci@@ alties . &apos; 
She also wants to use the EU environment better , and get more Cze@@ chs into European institutions .
Multi@@ speed Europe Is Com@@ ing
The amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress says Cze@@ chs are said to be Euro-@@ scep@@ tics ; as well as people notic@@ ing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions .
She thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the mo@@ dest@@ y of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the Czech side .
Along with the success of Czech presidency , she highlighted the power and cooperation of the Vis@@ e@@ grad Group .
&quot; Be@@ lie@@ ve me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary , and a Slovak is coming to join us , the Fren@@ ch@@ man next to me says : &quot; H@@ ey , what &apos;s that gathering about , is that the Vis@@ e@@ grad Group again ? &apos; and he is not happy about it in the sligh@@ test . &apos; 
In the Union &apos;s future , Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states .
Rather than a new European Federation , she finds the concept of two-@@ speed , if not multi-@@ speed Europe , very realistic .
&quot; We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; We have Schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . &quot;
&quot; For the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . &quot;
&quot; The number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two-@@ speed Europe , &quot; Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á expects .
In this regard , she appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Romp@@ u@@ y in pushing forward the rule based on which , all topics influ@@ encing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states , and not just those belonging into the Eurozone .
Brand St@@ ory :
The IM@@ B Innov@@ ator Star@@ ts the Second Century of Its Exist@@ ence
Should someone search for the word that would best express the IM@@ B strategy , the closest one would probably be &quot; long-term . &quot;
To the wide public , IM@@ B is a symbol of technological revolution ; the company is seen as a highly temporary one , yet it was founded over a hundred years ago .
The company &apos;s du@@ ra@@ bility goes back to its first bo@@ ss , a vision@@ ary , Thomas J. Watson S@@ r .
He believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
His motto : &apos; Th@@ ink ! &apos; thus become an im@@ print around which the life of the future giant would un@@ fold ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that IM@@ B started to publish in 19@@ 35 ) .
Moreover , it was the foundation of company culture Watson was building carefully .
&quot; For us in IM@@ B , long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .
IM@@ B survi@@ ved and flour@@ ished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around itself .
During our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
In the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , &quot; says current company Director , Samu@@ el J. Pal@@ mis@@ ano , on the occasion of the anniversary .
S@@ oph@@ istic@@ ated System
In the 1930@@ s , Watson appro@@ ached employee care simil@@ arly to Ba@@ ť@@ a in the Czech Republic - people from IM@@ B were among the first American employees to have a paid holiday , insurance from their emplo@@ yer , an elegant uniform , and a sophisticated system of bon@@ uses for the best invent@@ ors and business@@ men .
Just as sophisticated is IBM &apos;s long-term relationship with customers .
From the very beginning , the company was brilliant in explo@@ iting tal@@ ented people . It was one of the first world companies to abo@@ lish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .
Consi@@ stent with the anti-@@ discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , Vir@@ g@@ inia Rom@@ et@@ ty , to take over after Pal@@ mis@@ ano next year .
She has been working in IM@@ B for thirty years ; she is currently a Director of Sales , Marketing , and Strategy .
In the last few years , IM@@ B has been organising j@@ ams , on-line bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
It is no surprise that the ideas are pl@@ enti@@ ful - the company emplo@@ ys nearly half a million people .
Institution with a Good Rep@@ utation
Company &apos;s strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .
&quot; From the beginning , the concept of IBM was that of an institution rather than a technology company , &apos; a Harv@@ ard Business School Professor and author of a book about IBM , Ro@@ sa@@ beth Mo@@ ss Kan@@ ter , told the Econom@@ ist .
&quot; IBM is not a technology firm ; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology , &quot; George Col@@ ony of For@@ re@@ ster Research consultation company adds .
As the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
During the hundred years , IM@@ B , or the &quot; Big Blue , &quot; as it is called in the US because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to n@@ ano@@ technologies .
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price .
Its in@@ ventions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial s@@ wap , bar code , and flo@@ ppy disc .
With about 220 billion dollars , based on market capit@@ alisation , IBM has become the second largest technology company ( Apple being number one ) this year , over@@ running Microsoft for the first time since 1996 .
View A@@ head
Not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period . For example , IBM failed with its own operating system OS / 2 ; Pro@@ dig@@ y on-line services ; and IBM PC@@ j@@ r computers .
&quot; If your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emo@@ tionally attached to the past , &apos; says Samu@@ el J. Pal@@ mis@@ ano .
That is why IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work , it leaves them .
This is how it diff@@ ers from , for example , its competi@@ tor , Microsoft , which basically stands and falls on Windows , its operating system .
Per@@ spective Technology
IBM &apos;s revenues chie@@ fly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .
While in 1990 , with over a half share , it was the strongest hardware representative .
Since 2000 , IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . During the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
It has continued the investments even after 2008 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .
IBM follows the legacy of its first director , Thomas J. Watson , who increased the amount of investments during the Great Depression .
So far , IM@@ B seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm .
Since the beginning of 2008 , the price of IBM &apos;s shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company &apos;s net earnings have been growing continuously .
IBM &apos;s company motto is to change everything , except for its values .
We may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .
IBM History : From Che@@ ese C@@ utter To Space Travel
IBM ( International Business Mach@@ ines ) was founded in New York , a hundred years ago . Its original name &quot; Comp@@ uting Tab@@ ul@@ ating Rec@@ ording Corporation &quot; was quite complicated .
It took the name of IBM in 19@@ 24 . Origin@@ ally , this was a brand used for company &apos;s branches in Canada and South America .
Found@@ ations for the later IBM were laid by a mer@@ ger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 18@@ 8@@ 0s .
They owned technologies such as the legendary &quot; time clock , &quot; i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work .
The architect of the new company was a business@@ man , Charles Ran@@ le@@ tt F@@ lin@@ t , who , until 1930 , also pre@@ sided over the company &apos;s Board of Tru@@ ste@@ es .
F@@ lin@@ t hi@@ red a director of a competing company , Thomas J. Watson , to help him with company management .
The leader then put the IBM &apos;s founder in the sha@@ de - Watson &apos;s ideas remain the base for inv@@ inci@@ ble company culture and identity .
Watson led the company until 195@@ 2 .
IBM , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cut@@ ters to cash regi@@ sters .
During the first four years of Watson &apos;s leadership , the revenue doub@@ led to nine million dollars , and company &apos;s vast expansion into all continents comm@@ enced .
Watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly for@@ ty years , his position in the director &apos;s chair was taken by his son , Thomas Watson Junior .
Under his leadership , IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .
In 196@@ 0s , both people and computers from IBM helped N@@ ASA control space flights - to Mer@@ cury , Satur@@ n , and in 1969 , man &apos;s flight to the Mo@@ on .
Meanwhile , in 1964 , IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM line System / 360 .
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the period , called IBM 5@@ 150 , came to the market in 1981 .
T@@ w@@ enty years later , IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company , Len@@ ovo , While buying the consul@@ tant division of Pri@@ ce@@ water@@ hou@@ se@@ Co@@ op@@ ers , and thus comm@@ enced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .
In the past three years , IBM has been highly successful with its Smar@@ ter Planet concept .
Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management .
For commerce , IBM has recently introduced a Smar@@ ter Commerce platform that helps business@@ men control the whole commerce cycle .
IBM &apos;s history is strong even in our country .
In former Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia , as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe , IBM founded its branch in 19@@ 32 .
Today , IBM C@@ Z also runs a strategic outs@@ ourcing centre in Br@@ no .
The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe re@@ sides in Prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .
Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á about her Un@@ fai@@ thful Hus@@ band :
I@@ veto , keep the f@@ ool , I don &apos;t want him anymore !
Dar@@ ina Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á ( 53 ) said it is over !
After her husband , Josef Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř ( 53 ) , became both the bo@@ dy@@ guard and lo@@ ver of I@@ v@@ eta Bar@@ to@@ š@@ ov@@ á ( 45 ) , Dar@@ ina still hoped he would wake up and come back home .
However , she does not want to wait any longer , and set clear rules for her future life .
&quot; Pep@@ a may return home , but no longer as my partner , &quot; Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á explained .
When Dar@@ ina Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á provided shel@@ ter for Bar@@ to@@ š@@ ov@@ á in her house in summer , she probably had not the sligh@@ test idea of what was going to happen to her marriage .
Even though she had I@@ v@@ eta move out of Ř@@ í@@ č@@ any 30 days later , Pep@@ a would not leave the singer .
Moreover , he publi@@ cally admitted he loved her .
After some time , Dar@@ ina re@@ signed , pre@@ tended to accept her husband &apos;s affair ; and now she gave him her final good@@ by@@ e .
Ry@@ ch@@ y@@ t@@ á@@ ř does not care who his wife sle@@ ep@@ s with
Even if one day Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř and Bar@@ to@@ š@@ ov@@ á would split up , his wife will not welcome him with open arms .
&quot; He is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house , no one will ch@@ ase him out . &quot;
&quot; However , he will complete his days not as my bel@@ o@@ ved , lost and found old f@@ ool , but as a person I have certain bonds to , &quot; Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á said , adding she had already di@@ sen@@ g@@ aged herself from her husband and only insi@@ sts on mutual dec@@ ency .
So far , Josef does not mind that his wife closed the h@@ ind gate on him .
&quot; I respect my wife &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; I will be with I@@ v@@ eta , and I don &apos;t mean to change that . &quot;
&quot; My wife decided for marriage on paper , and I respect it . &quot;
&quot; Our company still operates ; I am in charge of repa@@ irs , garden , the house , and shopping . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ ina and I communicate in a completely normal way , only we do not share our bed anymore , &quot; Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř said for Bl@@ es@@ k .
He claims that if Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á found a new love , he would not stand in her way .
&quot; We don &apos;t sleep together , and I don &apos;t care where she goes , with whom , and if she has a boy@@ friend .
I know it &apos;s my fault , I fell in love with I@@ v@@ eta , and I accept full responsibility , &quot; Josef concluded .
The Wor@@ st F@@ emin@@ ine Hab@@ its : Do They Conc@@ ern You ?
When you ask men to name some typical bad hab@@ its women have , they usually come up with all of them in an instant .
De@@ ar ladies , do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow , descri@@ bing several women &apos;s hab@@ its that make the men see red ?
Shopping
Does your other half compla@@ in you are ad@@ dic@@ ted to shopping ?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week ?
Do you like shopping , in mass sales ?
If so , then your shopping may be seen as bad hab@@ it .
Some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping .
Still , who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all ( ideally , in various colour versions ) in the changing rooms ?
Shopping may be a ho@@ b@@ by for a majority of women , but for men , it may become absolute hell .
Just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside ...
Per@@ man@@ ent Dis@@ satisfaction
&quot; Am I too fat ? &quot;
&quot; I need to lose at least five ki@@ los - should I start doing some exercise ? &quot;
&quot; Are you still attracted to me ? &quot;
Do you find these sentences familiar ?
You do ?
Then , you belong to the group of women obs@@ essed by their appearance .
Not that you should stop looking after yourself , but many men are literary all@@ ergi@@ c to their partners &quot; constant complaints about their looks .
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more anno@@ ying women are .
Order and Clean@@ liness First
It is like a never ending story .
Cleaning the windows , vacu@@ um@@ ing , wi@@ ping the floors , du@@ sting , sc@@ rub@@ bing the bath@@ tub - at least twice a week .
Do you blame your partner for step@@ ping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes ; your children for mess@@ ing up a clean s@@ ink and leaving finger@@ prints over the glass pan@@ e in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
In case you suffer from this &quot; devi@@ ation , &quot; try to realise that no extre@@ mes are good ; and that within your family , order and clean@@ liness should not go first .
This harm@@ less desire for clean@@ liness may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire family .
Bo@@ ss@@ ing About
&quot; Th@@ row the under@@ wear into the bin . &quot;
&quot; Do you plan to wear the dirty so@@ cks tomorrow ? &quot;
&quot; W@@ et dish@@ towels do not belong on the floor . &quot;
If you bo@@ ss your partner around several times a day , he may find it very anno@@ ying .
Naturally , you mean well , you just want everything to be perfect .
Maybe , if men realised that , women would not have to bo@@ ss them around so much ...
Go@@ ssi@@ ping
Some women love go@@ ssi@@ ping , offen@@ ding , and p@@ lot@@ ting against others .
Women are focused on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
Every now and then , probably each of us releases a go@@ ssi@@ p here or there .
Let &apos;s be fran@@ k , this is probably the nature all women .
However , there are tou@@ gher go@@ ssi@@ ps , women who enjoy frequent go@@ ssi@@ ping and des@@ p@@ ise everyone . They are , especially within a female work team , very dangerous for their surroundings .
Assi@@ sts of J@@ á@@ g@@ r and Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek Hel@@ ped Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a &apos;s Vic@@ tory
During Monday &apos;s N@@ H@@ L match , ho@@ ckey forward , J@@ arom@@ í@@ r J@@ á@@ g@@ r &apos;s two assi@@ sts helped Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a &apos;s victory 5 : 3 on Carol@@ ina &apos;s ice . Again , he leads the productivity of Czech players in the game .
In both cases , Claude Gi@@ rou@@ x , used the experience of a thir@@ ty-@@ nine year old star ; he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
Two assi@@ sts in the match also belon@@ ged to J@@ á@@ g@@ r &apos;s te@@ am-@@ m@@ ate , J@@ aku@@ b Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek .
After the match , J@@ á@@ g@@ r told the overseas journalists he had predic@@ ted a great evening for Gi@@ rou@@ x .
&quot; I told him before the match he would score a h@@ at-@@ tri@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; I felt it . &quot;
&quot; You sometimes feel such things , &quot; explained J@@ á@@ g@@ r , after whose action Gi@@ rou@@ x sco@@ red a goal on the first Fl@@ yers &quot; shot .
A little bit later , second score for the team b@@ ore Czech traces too .
The tra@@ iling Hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es &apos; Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek won the pu@@ ck and presented it to Max@@ im Tal@@ bot , who sco@@ red between the circles .
A second before the first break , a home player , Patrick D@@ w@@ yer , narro@@ wed the lead in a power@@ -@@ play , but the beginning of the second part was led by Fl@@ yers again .
Spec@@ ific@@ ally by Gi@@ rou@@ x .
After assist with J@@ á@@ g@@ r , he sco@@ red the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a fourth goal by Wa@@ y@@ ne Sim@@ mon@@ ds .
&quot; I love playing with him . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t ; want to say he &apos;s the best le@@ ague player , but he &apos;s definitely among the best three , &quot; said J@@ á@@ g@@ r , compli@@ ment@@ ing his center .
&quot; I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a ho@@ ckey player like him . &quot;
&quot; It makes me happy . &quot;
&quot; I want to assist him . &quot;
&quot; All those years in N@@ H@@ L , my te@@ am-@@ m@@ ates tried to assist me , and now its rever@@ sing , &quot; J@@ á@@ g@@ r added .
Carol@@ ina made the match more dramatic with Tu@@ omo Ru@@ ut@@ u and D@@ w@@ yer &apos;s goal from a penalty shot , making it a single goal difference .
Further complic@@ ations were avoided by Mat@@ t Read who increased the difference to two points .
&quot; P@@ ron@@ ger did great in our zone . &quot;
&quot; He po@@ ked out the pu@@ ck , I gained speed , and Read went on to the more distant p@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; I aimed at him , and I &apos;m glad it worked , &quot; Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek described his view of the last goal of the match .
Its victory moved Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a onto the top of the Eastern Conference .
Czech Montreal def@@ ens@@ em@@ an , J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Š@@ pa@@ č@@ ek , did not finish the match with Buff@@ al@@ o ; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury .
Along with the experienced back , the Can@@ di@@ ens lost their two-@@ goal lead and lost 2 : 3 after a penalty sho@@ ot-@@ out .
Tom@@ á@@ š Ple@@ kan@@ ec failed to score on one of their ra@@ ids .
More than lost points , the home tra@@ iner was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defen@@ ders .
&quot; The situation is bad . &quot;
&quot; We finished the match with just one experienced player , the rest were young men . &quot;
&quot; However , there is nothing we can do about that , we just have to face it , &quot; Jacques Martin said .
&quot; Sub@@ stitution by sub@@ stitution , it was overwhelming and we couldn &apos;t resist . &quot;
&quot; We should have made the game simpler , moving the pu@@ ck out of our zone . &quot;
&quot; That was our weakness , &quot; a def@@ ender , P. K. Sub@@ ban added .
With thirty interventions , Czech go@@ ali@@ e , On@@ d@@ ř@@ e@@ j Pa@@ vel@@ ec , helped W@@ inn@@ i@@ pe@@ g &apos;s 5 : 2 victory over Tamp@@ a Bay .
J@@ ets &quot; goals , which interrupted a five-@@ match series of losses , were shared by five different sc@@ or@@ ers .
Development of Tri@@ p Prices Since 1989
Until 1989 , only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia : Č@@ e@@ do@@ k , Sport@@ ur@@ ist , C@@ K@@ M , Re@@ kre@@ a , and Aut@@ ot@@ ur@@ ist .
As travelling to the West was strictly limited , travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries .
For their holiday , Czech tourists thus went to the sea to the German Democratic Republic ; Soviet Union ( So@@ chi , Cri@@ me@@ a near the Black Sea ) ; Bulgaria ; Romania ( both to the Black Sea ) ; and Hungary ( Bal@@ aton ) .
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 , when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia . Nevertheless , the Yugosla@@ vian regime turned West , which caused significant limitations to trips to Yugoslavia for Czech tourists .
A great parado@@ x of the soci@@ alistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ aks too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .
If a Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ ak citizen wanted to travel , as an individual , to , for example , the Soviet Union or Poland , an invitation letter from the country was necessary ; otherwise , individual travel was impossible .
At the time , travel agencies would offer some trips to the West , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some &quot; good friends &quot; in the agency .
Still , that was not all .
A foreign currency assurance was essential for tra@@ vels to the West . It was not granted to politically un@@ reliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all .
Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian currency was not freely con@@ verti@@ ble ; without the currency assurance , it was not possible to obtain financial means ( Western currency ) for travelling West .
Most often , Cze@@ chs spent their holiday at home , which resulted in great number of cot@@ tages and summer houses , a hab@@ it that survi@@ ves until now .
Since 1989 , Czech tourism thus experienced a real revolution .
While until 1989 , a holiday in the G@@ DR or Bulgaria was the cli@@ max of our tra@@ vels , last year , Cze@@ chs spent 4.@@ 5 million holidays in countries all over the world .
A great parado@@ x we do not realise anymore is that until 1989 , we could not freely visit the currently most popular Croatia , as it was part of former Yugoslavia .
Right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements for neighbouring West European countries were cancelled . This started a huge wave of short-term visits of chie@@ fly Vienna and Germany .
Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ aks could not get enough of travelling to the West . Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment .
For example , in Paris , Czech tours sle@@ pt in parks in t@@ ents , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension .
A typical feature of Czech tourism then was bringing their own food ( cans , sal@@ ami , etc . ) to save money .
Another important moment was the introduction of freely con@@ verti@@ ble Czech Cro@@ wn . After decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies .
Our living standards and average income were growing , which , around 1997 , resulted in another important moment .
Since 1997 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . Comp@@ ared to the past , air trips thus became un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts .
By the end of 1990s , Cze@@ chs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries , except for the USA . This made our travelling even easier .
The next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000 . High demand resulted in the histor@@ ically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country , Thailand .
Since then , direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries . This winter , flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations .
Currently about 100 thousand Cze@@ chs visit exotic countries every year !
Yet another important event of this period , symboli@@ sing our development after the revolution , came in 2008 .
On November 17 , 2008 , the USA removed visa requirements for Czech tourists . Our country has thus permanently joined the world &apos;s most developed countries .
For the first time in history , in 2008 Cze@@ chs spent more than a half of their holidays abroad ( 5@@ 0.@@ 3 % ) ; and for the first time in history , they spent over 15 thousand Cro@@ wns per person per holiday abroad , including their costs at the destination .
General Meeting Should Find a President , M@@ ate Th@@ re@@ at Retur@@ ns
For nearly five months , Czech football has had no President . There exists a risk that I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek &apos;s successor , the head of Czech Republic &apos;s Foot@@ ball Association ( FA@@ Č@@ R ) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in Ny@@ m@@ bur@@ k on Thursday .
There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow .
Without it , voting for the three candidates will not start .
J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta , and Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k are e@@ ager to lead Czech football .
Ha@@ š@@ ek re@@ signed from his function in June . When leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .
However , Ha@@ š@@ ek &apos;s era sees football back in quar@@ rel@@ s between both association cham@@ bers , unable to agree on a common candidate .
This was fully shown on September 16 , when a new President was to be chosen .
General meeting deleg@@ ates wa@@ sted their trip to the National House in Prague , Sm@@ í@@ cho@@ v , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of att@@ or@@ ney .
This single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law , according to which representation based on power of att@@ or@@ ney is not possible .
Argum@@ ents concerning the election rules continue , though .
The Executive Board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly pre@@ occupied by this issue .
The view of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .
The question is : How to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid m@@ ate ?
&quot; The argument is based on whether to follow the by-@@ laws or to find another model , &quot; says one of the three FA@@ Č@@ R Vice-@@ Presidents , Du@@ š@@ an Sv@@ oboda , who represents professional football in the association &apos;s management .
Based on the model given by the by-@@ laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
Mor@@ a@@ via is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both cham@@ bers win the election .
The Czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two-@@ third su@@ peri@@ ority .
&quot; However , the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning ; that would completely deny the two-@@ chamber concept , &quot; Sv@@ oboda agrees with Mor@@ a@@ via &apos;s arguments . He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations .
Some@@ what surpris@@ ingly Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by-@@ laws fits Pel@@ ta best of the candidates .
&apos;@@ I wish the elections follow the by-@@ laws to the maximum . &apos; 
&quot; I want to avoid all kinds of representative non@@ sense , as at the previous general meeting , &quot; says the owner of Vi@@ kt@@ orie Pl@@ ze@@ ň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chie@@ fly stood against Pel@@ ta .
Pel@@ ta remains an optim@@ ist .
He believes the new President will be known in Ny@@ m@@ bur@@ k ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate construc@@ tively .
&quot; All passion@@ ate stir@@ ring will calm down with today &apos;s prospec@@ tive advance of the national team into the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; Foot@@ ball will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , &quot; a J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec func@@ tionary says . Of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l is more reserved .
&quot; I hope for an agreement , but the situation is very ambi@@ valent . &quot;
&quot; It is not between people from Boh@@ em@@ ia and Mor@@ a@@ via , but there are attempts at pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful adjustment of regulations . &quot;
&quot; That may cause another block@@ age of the general meeting . &quot;
&quot; I hope the common sense wins , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said .
There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .
Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro ; but who knows if the football gener@@ ality will be complete before the match .
An extra flight that was to take , among others , the Vice Presidents D@@ ali@@ bor Ku@@ č@@ era and Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l to Pod@@ gor@@ ica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure . An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the bar@@ ra@@ ged re@@ match .
Finally , a meeting at mini@@ stry level , said to happen on Wednesday , may decide .
Minister of Education , Youth , and Sports , Josef Do@@ be@@ š , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .
A lot is in the game : Government grants ; football tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ; and the planned Č@@ S@@ TV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sa@@ z@@ ka &apos;s financial problems .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k En@@ ters the Presiden@@ tial Fi@@ ght As He Can@@ not See a Su@@ itable Can@@ di@@ date
If , before the extraordinary general meeting , the Head of Pil@@ sen football players , Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , saw a strong candidate , who would meet all of his expectations of a new Foot@@ ball Association of the Czech Republic ( FA@@ Č@@ R ) President , he would not even apply for the top function .
&quot; If there was a good quality candidate , I &apos;d fight for him and not participate in the fight . &quot;
&quot; But no such person has currently been found , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said to Č@@ T@@ K .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k &apos;s motivation to join the fight with Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta and J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l is to try to prevent Pel@@ ta , re@@ porte@@ dly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the FA@@ Č@@ R .
Moreover , P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k emphasi@@ zes that should he win , he would only remain the President until 2013 , when a regular general meeting is scheduled .
In the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not exc@@ essively connected to football life .
&quot; I &apos;ve spoken to some people that could be considered . &quot;
&quot; I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they don &apos;t even want to identify themselves with Czech football . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to change this opinion , &quot; he said .
At the moment , P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k &apos;s strongest dis@@ agreement with Pel@@ ta is based on the latter &apos;s connection to Roman Ber@@ b@@ r , President of Pil@@ sen &apos;s regional football association . Ber@@ ber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lob@@ by@@ ist , capable of influ@@ encing the votes of general meeting deleg@@ ates .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k therefore finds it unacceptable for Pel@@ ta to become the President .
&quot; If he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ bin@@ ed with support from Ber@@ b@@ r , a capable business@@ man , this would be even more harmful for the football , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said .
He is hin@@ ting at the fact that some years ago , Pel@@ ta &apos;s name was recorded during phone ta@@ pping in a corruption affair investigation ; Pel@@ ta came out without a sentence .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what pre@@ stige Pel@@ ta &apos;s victory would bring to football . &quot;
&quot; And how would we look in the eyes U@@ EFA and FIFA , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said . He is now more deta@@ ched from his former statement saying he would &quot; sell the Pil@@ sen club if Pel@@ ta became President . &quot;
In case P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k wins on Thursday , he could imagine cooperation with Pel@@ ta in the future .
This opinion is shared by another candidate , Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , whom P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fi@@ as@@ co .
&quot; He ( Pel@@ ta ) would be the first one I &apos;d go to . &quot;
&apos;@@ He is very capable . &apos; 
&quot; I can see him as the head of the representation . &quot;
&apos;@@ But he cannot manage the association . &apos; 
&quot; I don &apos;t po@@ ke my nose in what I don &apos;t understand either , &apos; said P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , who gained a lot of attention in September , when he supported the removal of board of refer@@ ees , led by Lud@@ ě@@ k Mac@@ ela , replaced by D@@ ag@@ mar Dam@@ kov@@ á .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k claims he would dare to manage the association .
He refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the Pil@@ sen team that , with his support , celebrated its first le@@ ague tri@@ umph in May .
&quot; I have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . &quot;
&quot; To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board , leading to dis@@ gu@@ sting situations , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said . He does not hide his anti@@ pa@@ thy for , e.g. S@@ part@@ a &apos;s Director , Daniel K@@ ř@@ et@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý .
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FA@@ Č@@ R and the Czech Olympic Committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lo@@ tter@@ y tax .
&quot; That &apos;s one of the key things the new President should attend to . &quot;
&quot; If taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , I understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , &quot; he said .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k does not consider his connection with the Pil@@ sen club a burden , though he claims that an FA@@ Č@@ R President should be a non-@@ party one .
Pel@@ ta is connected to J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec , and Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l to Prague Du@@ kl@@ a .
&quot; It &apos;s not ideal . &quot;
&quot; Yet , I don &apos;t see a point in transferring my shares in the Pil@@ sen club hypo@@ cri@@ tically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k says .
Pel@@ ta Pro@@ mis@@ ed New FA@@ Č@@ R Regul@@ ations That Would A@@ void Ele@@ ction M@@ ate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the Presiden@@ tial candidates , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new FA@@ Č@@ R regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .
Before the Thursday negotiations in Ny@@ m@@ bur@@ k , a J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec func@@ tionary remains an optim@@ ist and believes that the pre-@@ election fight would be significantly sup@@ pressed by today &apos;s prospec@@ tive success of our football representation .
Pri@@ or to the failed election in September , Pel@@ ta promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment . A two-@@ month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .
&quot; People at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the President to be known on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; They feel it &apos;s high time someone leads the association , &quot; claims the man chie@@ fly connected with the J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec club ; but he spent many years in S@@ part@@ a and the association &apos;s executive board .
This gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage Czech football .
He believes current problems with elections are caused by the eu@@ ph@@ oria there was in the time of I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek &apos;s re@@ ign .
&quot; Unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June . &quot;
&quot; If various represent@@ ations were not accepted , we would have had a President since September , &quot; Pel@@ ta said .
He appro@@ ached the re@@ writing of the key document of the civil association as a de@@ co@@ y for the deleg@@ ates .
&quot; If I become President , I will take it as my personal task , and I &apos;m willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . &quot;
&quot; It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , &quot; Pel@@ ta claims .
Other than that , he says he does not try to define himself against the ri@@ vals .
In the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his ri@@ val candidate should become his first Vice President .
For a long time , he did not attack Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , who has constantly criticised Pel@@ ta .
&quot; He &apos;s been in football for over a year , and gained some success . &quot;
&quot; However , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . &quot;
&quot; This is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , &quot; Pel@@ ta said about his ri@@ val . Pel@@ ta himself claims to be true to the proc@@ lam@@ ations he announced in September .
He sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football , from the lowest competitions to representation .
The representation should be the shopping window of football .
&quot; Í would also try to end all affairs , starting from the Boh@@ em@@ ians case or the after@@ math of last year &apos;s corruption scandal . &quot;
&quot; Right after that , I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , &quot; the fort@@ y-@@ six year old candidate told Č@@ T@@ K two months ago .
He then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel hou@@ sec@@ le@@ an@@ ing .
&quot; I &apos;d need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . &quot; That was his message for Stra@@ ho@@ v , where the long period of inter@@ re@@ gn@@ um causes understandable ner@@ v@@ ousness .
Despite current catastrop@@ hi@@ c scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on Thursday , the deleg@@ ates will not come to Ny@@ m@@ bur@@ k in v@@ ain .
&quot; If the only question@@ able point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . &quot;
&quot; Foot@@ ball needs tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess it can only gain by finally having its leader , &quot; says Pel@@ ta , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a func@@ tionary , remains an optim@@ ist .
Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l Pro@@ mises That under H@@ im , the FA@@ Č@@ R Will Start Working H@@ ard
If , on Thursday &apos;s general meeting , J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , the existing Vice President , is to become the President of Czech Foot@@ ball Association , many people in the Association would re@@ porte@@ dly not be pleased .
Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .
He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas .
He also promised to solve the Boh@@ em@@ ians case ; improve relations with both U@@ EFA and FIFA ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous President , I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek .
&quot; As President , I &apos;d like to focus on football as a whole . &quot;
&quot; From international contacts with U@@ EFA and FIFA , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . &quot;
&quot; By this , I don &apos;t mean I &apos;d do everything on my own , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said in his interview for Č@@ T@@ K .
&quot; I &apos;m a team player , and I want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . &quot;
&apos;@@ I &apos;ll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments , football makes big steps forward . &quot;
&quot; That would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just critici@@ zing of the work of others , &quot; he added .
Cri@@ tical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candi@@ dat@@ ure .
&quot; I &apos;m known to work 20 hours a day . &quot;
&quot; But I need to know if it has any sense ; and that I won &apos;t be surrounded by people thro@@ wing sti@@ cks under my feet and question my every move , &quot; he explained his he@@ si@@ tation .
&quot; However , many people told me I mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t give up , otherwise others would follow . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a trust I can &apos;t just throw away , &quot; he said .
Moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Ha@@ š@@ ek .
&quot; A great amount of work was done in those two years , and I don &apos;t want to throw it all away . &quot;
&quot; Proc@@ esses have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and I don &apos;t want someone else to stop them , &quot; he said , in fear that if the other candidate , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta , is elected , situation f the Association might return to the period before Ha@@ š@@ ek .
&quot; I believe in systematic approach , which is something I don &apos;t think Mi@@ re@@ k Pel@@ ta is competent of . &quot;
&quot; He is chie@@ fly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . &quot;
&quot; I can be bl@@ amed for many things , but certainly not for being subjec@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; I try to be objective . &quot;
&quot; I want to make football for everyone , because then everyone has a good time , not just the chosen few , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said .
Furthermore , he re@@ fut@@ es the alleg@@ ations he would only be a Czech President .
&quot; Though some people try to claim the opposite , I plan to do the maximum for Mor@@ a@@ via . &quot;
&quot; For example , it is high time to consider about sp@@ lit@@ ting the second le@@ ague into Czech and Mor@@ avian parts , winners of which would continue into the first le@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; This would prevent the current situation , where there are just three Mor@@ avian units in the le@@ ague , which is a problem concerning young players in Mor@@ a@@ via , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said .
As the Presiden@@ tial fight has been joined by Pil@@ sen club Manager , Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
&quot; Nevertheless , I can still feel a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me its Vice President , and can see I have achieved some clear successes , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said . Among his successes , he includes the saving of doz@@ ens of millions of Cro@@ wns on disadvanta@@ geous contracts , negotiating TV contracts , and negotiations about the lo@@ tter@@ y law .
On the other hand , he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
While claiming that Pel@@ ta has been &apos; dis@@ qualified from returning tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess to Czech football &apos; , he considers the other ri@@ val , P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , a strong candidate that has things to offer .
&quot; No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pil@@ sen this year . &quot;
&quot; If he is elected , I hope he would continue in the things I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek started , without significant personnel changes in the committees . &quot;
&quot; He w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to tw@@ ist things for his own benefit , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said about his ri@@ val .
Europe &apos;s most beautiful pools
Le@@ ap into the water
By Ju@@ lia Stan@@ ek
P@@ add@@ ling pools with universal fi@@ bre op@@ tics and status pools in Budapest . Trav@@ ellers can experience Europe &apos;s incredible water - and relax tired lim@@ bs in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or a ra@@ m@@ ble .
One book can tell you where the water is at its best .
There was one thing Ir@@ is Me@@ der could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years : her swimming cost@@ ume .
L@@ ying back on the water , she has looked up at arti@@ stically designed dom@@ es , has sw@@ um towards marble cher@@ ubs awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has mar@@ v@@ elled at me@@ ticul@@ ously restored art nou@@ veau swimming pools .
She rus@@ hed to add any pool she liked to her note@@ book - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building .
The architectural hist@@ orian Me@@ der looked at more than 200 swimming pools - and has now compiled here experiences in her recently published book Bade@@ freu@@ den ( The Jo@@ ys of Ba@@ thing ) , covering everything from public swimming baths in Munich to historical bathing pal@@ aces in the Black Forest and &quot; hard@@ core concrete buildings &quot; in Ta@@ un@@ us .
Her &quot; journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe &quot; took here through 13 countries . Besides Germany , Austria and Switzerland , she visited baths in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia .
The 4@@ 6-@@ year-old is a real bathing culture enthusi@@ ast .
She has very little enthusiasm for sport , says Me@@ der - but in the water , it &apos;s a different matter .
The only down@@ side is that fans of swimming have to cope with blue gla@@ zed tiles and the sten@@ ch of ch@@ lor@@ ine while jo@@ g@@ gers can brea@@ the in the be@@ gu@@ iling sc@@ ent of spru@@ ce forests or listen to the bright twi@@ tter@@ ing of birds in the park .
&quot; One day , I asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ug@@ ly , &quot; says Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based Me@@ der .
&quot; So I started collecting beautiful baths . &quot;
Water surface doub@@ les architecture
S@@ pl@@ ash@@ ing in the diving pool and e@@ there@@ al sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimul@@ ated , according to Me@@ der .
And swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the buil@@ ders have gone to the trouble . &quot; You have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor . &quot;
&quot; The surface is very transparent , but also reflects the beauty of the entire building . &quot;
Everything is mir@@ ro@@ red vis@@ ually : high ceilings , colourful tiles and diving boards .
The illustr@@ ated po@@ cket@@ book The Jo@@ ys of Ba@@ thing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health o@@ ases over 190 pages - and makes you want to lea@@ p into the water .
Pool collec@@ tor Me@@ der discovered some notable examples during research in Hungary .
She found nit@@ rat@@ e-@@ rich water in a kar@@ st cave ( the Ca@@ ve Bath in Mis@@ kol@@ c@@ ta@@ pol@@ ca ) and a thermal bath filled with al@@ kal@@ ine water in a bot@@ t@@ le-@@ shaped building ( V@@ á@@ ro@@ si Ter@@ m@@ á@@ l@@ für@@ d@@ ö in J@@ á@@ sz@@ ber@@ é@@ ny ) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 10@@ 0-@@ year-old Sz@@ é@@ chen@@ y@@ i baths in Budapest .
Many of the heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria , on the other hand , offer spectacular views . You can view all of Zurich from a ro@@ of@@ top bath or look out on the sno@@ w-@@ c@@ apped Ar@@ l@@ berg from an outdoor pool in St. An@@ ton . And there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski pi@@ ste .
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits ba@@ thers in Län@@ gen@@ feld . The Aqu@@ a D@@ ome in Ö@@ tz@@ tal looks like a U@@ F@@ O has just land@@ ed in the Alps .
It ste@@ ams during the winter from three open-@@ t@@ opp@@ ed sh@@ ells d@@ war@@ fed by the Ö@@ tz@@ tal mountains behind it .
Al@@ ham@@ bra in the Black Forest
Pool collec@@ tor Me@@ der was not gre@@ eted by the smell of ch@@ lor@@ ine in every swimming pool .
A lot of thermal baths smell of sul@@ ph@@ ur . The Á@@ r@@ p@@ á@@ d baths in B@@ é@@ kes@@ c@@ sab@@ a , Hungary , smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa .
The smell comes from the hydro@@ gen car@@ bon@@ ate in the al@@ kal@@ ine water . The water is almost black with si@@ lt that sti@@ cks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a particular kind .
Ir@@ is Me@@ der , however , was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places . When she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Lu@@ hat@@ scho@@ wi@@ tz , she found the area se@@ aled off .
The baths , designed by the architect Du@@ š@@ an Jur@@ ko@@ vic in 19@@ 02 , have been closed .
When Me@@ der looked through the we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ be@@ aten windows of the red , white and yellow art nou@@ veau building , she could see we@@ eds growing up through the tiles .
One place where dec@@ ay has been stopped in its tracks is a magical swimming bath in the Black Forest - the Palais Ther@@ mal in Bad Wild@@ bad .
The baths have already gone through three stages of construction . You will not only discover neo-@@ Roman@@ es@@ que elements from the period after it was built in 18@@ 44 , but also a Mo@@ or@@ ish hall in Al@@ ham@@ bra style added around 1900 .
Following its careful modernisation in 1995 , the Palais Ther@@ mal is the favourite swimming pool of pool con@@ nois@@ se@@ ur Ir@@ is Me@@ der - and not just because she comes from the Black Forest .
&quot; It is a real achievement to harmonise such different architectural styles so brilli@@ antly , &quot; says Me@@ der .
A di@@ p in the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly of secondary importance .
Agri@@ cultural commodities speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodity trading investigated
By Christian Te@@ ev@@ s
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural commodities ?
According to SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL ON@@ LIN@@ E , Josef A@@ cker@@ mann has given a working group the task of investig@@ ating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .
The CEO plans to make changes in January .
Hamburg -
For German citizens the situation is clear . According to one study , 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks spec@@ ulate on agricultural commodities such as whe@@ at and ma@@ ize .
Two thirds of those ques@@ tioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading deep@@ ens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .
The findings were made in a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute for Social Research and Statisti@@ cal Analy@@ sis on behalf of the consumer organisation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
The study is based on a report presented by F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch in mid-@@ October .
The author of the report , Har@@ ald Schum@@ ann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complic@@ it in global hunger .
The campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank , Josef A@@ cker@@ mann , although large banking houses such as Gold@@ man Sach@@ s and Morgan Stan@@ ley trade in the same way .
Origin@@ ally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctu@@ ations .
However , most experts now agree that the gam@@ bl@@ ers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are prof@@ iting at the expense of the poorest .
In contrast to US competitors , A@@ cker@@ mann has responded to the criticism . He has promised to investigate the accus@@ ations and has said that no trade is &quot; worth putting Deutsche Bank &apos;s good reputation at risk . &quot;
According to SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL ON@@ LIN@@ E , an international working group is currently investig@@ ating the accus@@ ations contained in the F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch report .
The investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank &apos;s board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January .
Comm@@ odi@@ ties trading may be reduced or stopped completely .
A@@ cker@@ mann working on his image
The president of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , Th@@ il@@ o Bo@@ de , welcomed the news while emphasi@@ sing his criticism of the financial sector . &quot; Bet@@ ting on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thou@@ ght@@ lessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . &quot;
As top bank lob@@ by@@ ist , A@@ cker@@ mann has a particular duty , according to Bo@@ de .
&quot; Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices , &quot; said Bo@@ de .
&quot; It does not matter whether this is about star@@ ving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank . &quot;
A@@ cker@@ mann &apos;s sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned .
Canc@@ elling con@@ ten@@ tious food commodity speculation could improve his image .
He also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome .
One in two people would withdraw commodities investments
F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch is stri@@ ving to keep up the pressure on the manager .
To date , more than 30@@ ,000 internet users have joined the organisation &apos;s campaign .
Bo@@ de published the survey on Tuesday . The survey was conducted for the For@@ sa Institute for Social Research and Statisti@@ cal Analy@@ sis on 7 and 8 November and 10@@ 01 people took part .
No more than ele@@ ven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .
Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading . According to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .
2@@ 1@@ er Haus in Vienna
The re@@ located pa@@ vi@@ lion
By In@@ geb@@ org Wi@@ en@@ so@@ wski
An architectural history with high@@ s , lows and a happ@@ y-@@ ever-@@ after . Austria &apos;s P@@ avi@@ lion for the 1958 World &apos;s Fair in Brussels won prizes , became a museum in Vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
Now it is being re@@ opened as an exhibition centre .
Austria &apos;s pa@@ vi@@ lion , designed by Karl Schwan@@ zer for the 1958 Brussels World &apos;s Fair , is a famous text@@ book example of modern post-@@ war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold stro@@ kes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .
Schwan@@ zer &apos;s pa@@ vi@@ lion won the Grand Prix d &apos;@@ Archit@@ ec@@ ture in 1958 for its light flo@@ ating ste@@ el-@@ glass structure .
The building is considered a mile@@ stone in contemporary architecture .
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria &apos;s pa@@ vi@@ lion at the next world &apos;s fair .
He finally shot to f@@ ame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four-@@ cy@@ linder BMW Tower and its bow@@ l-@@ shaped sister building .
The pa@@ vi@@ lion , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was re@@ located to the Schweizer Garten near Vienna &apos;s Süd@@ bahnhof , converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the &quot; 20@@ er Haus &quot; for this reason .
However , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spati@@ al reasons - it had no walls to hang art@@ works and poor air conditioning .
Nonetheless , it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home .
The building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
The architect Ad@@ olf Kris@@ chan@@ itz has now renovated the pa@@ vi@@ lion , which has been named the &quot; 2@@ 1@@ er Haus &quot; and will be used as a contemporary art museum .
The museum is a branch of the Bel@@ ve@@ dere museum , which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
A@@ gn@@ es H@@ uss@@ l@@ ein@@ -@@ Ar@@ co who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Bel@@ ve@@ dere in 2007 was instru@@ mental in the new beginning .
H@@ uss@@ l@@ ein@@ -@@ Ar@@ co , an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice sk@@ ater , who went on to So@@ the@@ by &apos;s , the Gu@@ ggen@@ heim Museum and to become the founding director of the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg , convinced politicians and con@@ serv@@ ators to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private spon@@ sor@@ ship and decided on the use of the building .
The new museum was to house the F@@ ritz W@@ ot@@ ru@@ ba Foundation &apos;s permanent collection , a café and a book@@ shop alongside contemporary art . An office building was also to be built .
Stri@@ ct supervision &amp; limited budget
Kris@@ chan@@ itz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project .
He was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded Joseph Ol@@ bri@@ ch &apos;s Sec@@ ession in Vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under Schwan@@ zer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pa@@ vi@@ lion was an &quot; exceptionally important place &quot; for him where had visited exhibitions &quot; almost every weekend . &quot;
He knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already lost some of its gran@@ de@@ ur and ligh@@ tness when it was re@@ located to Vienna and converted .
The problems facing the latest alter@@ ations were much greater . The building was &quot; an energy gu@@ zz@@ ler , &quot; says Kris@@ chan@@ itz .
The window profiles of the glass fac@@ ade were replaced , fi@@ b@@ reg@@ l@@ ass@@ -@@ reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by high-@@ grade safety glass .
Ther@@ mal bridge steel gir@@ ders were strengthened or replaced and as@@ best@@ os was removed from ceilings .
Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a sun@@ ken light well between the building and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate Schwan@@ zer pa@@ vi@@ lion .
The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old re@@ d-@@ brown colour of ru@@ st-@@ pro@@ o@@ fing .
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be .
All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .
&quot; We often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority , &quot; says Kris@@ chan@@ itz , pointing to the rough flo@@ oring in the bas@@ ement .
The building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints , problems and conver@@ sions .
Kris@@ chan@@ itz stated recently that the pa@@ vi@@ lion &quot; from Brussels &quot; had been tough - a typical &quot; drop in the city &quot; story .
Archit@@ ec@@ ture like this is &quot; always in the wrong place &quot; and nonetheless wants to &quot; stimulate a real awareness . &quot;
The 2@@ 1@@ er Haus is very much in the right place , as there has been a stro@@ ke of luck in town planning . The completely re@@ designed &quot; main station quarter &quot; with offices and residential properties is developing around the Schweizer Garten .
There may also be a second stro@@ ke of luck . The 2@@ 1@@ er Haus may be bol@@ stered by another Kris@@ chan@@ itz building - the collec@@ tor Franc@@ es@@ ca von Hab@@ sburg has purchased the Tem@@ por@@ äre Kunsth@@ alle Berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten .
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package into the millions
Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancell@@ ations in the winter .
The number of employees is to double .
The costs will run into the millions .
According to a newspaper report , Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million Euros more this year in the battle to prevent w@@ inter-@@ time cancell@@ ations and delays .
Refer@@ ring to an internal crisis plan at Deutsche Bahn , the Bild newspaper has reported that investment of around 300 million Euros in total is planned up to 2015 .
Investment is intended to improve the availability of lo@@ com@@ o@@ tives and the rail network , even in the face of extreme weather conditions .
The number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 16@@ ,000 .
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by start of business and 90 percent of the critical points within four to five hours .
Rü@@ diger Gru@@ be , head of Deutsche Bahn , warned of train cancell@@ ations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago .
Last winter , Deutsche Bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business , as it lack@@ ed reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions .
Num@@ erous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office .
There is also some delay in the delivery of ICE trains .
Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to have the ax@@ les of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently for many years , after an ICE train &apos;s ax@@ le broke in Cologne &apos;s main station .
Deutsche Bank pays multi-@@ million po@@ und fine in the USA
Fres@@ h trouble is following hard on the he@@ els of the u@@ pro@@ ar around Josef A@@ cker@@ mann , CEO of Deutsche Bank : Deutsche Bank faces a multi-@@ million po@@ und fine in the USA .
As if the problems at home were not already enough for Deutsche Bank , the industry giant &apos;s past in the USA is now also cat@@ ching up with it . Frankfur@@ t-@@ based Deutsche Bank will pay 14@@ 5 million dollars ( 10@@ 6 million Euros ) to settle disputes arising from the bank@@ rupt@@ cy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis .
The issue centres on the sale of mort@@ gage securities .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NC@@ U@@ A ) , a financial market regul@@ ator , acc@@ uses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mis@@ lead credit unions into buying the financial products .
The value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions .
&quot; We are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court , &quot; said a Deutsche Bank spo@@ kes@@ man in new York .
The bank did not admit culp@@ ability in the settlement .
The same is true of C@@ iti@@ group , which agreed to pay 20.@@ 5 million dollars .
The NC@@ U@@ A chairman , Deb@@ bie Mat@@ z , welcomed the respon@@ si@@ veness of the two banks .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NC@@ U@@ A ) is responsible for the US credit unions and interven@@ es in bank@@ rupt@@ cies to protect customer deposits .
The NC@@ U@@ A is fighting for compensation for losses that run into the billions .
The current settlements are the first of their kind .
The regul@@ ator had also appro@@ ached other major banks and su@@ ed JP@@ Morgan Ch@@ ase , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in the summer .
The du@@ bi@@ ous mort@@ gage securities are so-called mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities .
They are under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by home loans .
This se@@ aled the fate of a number of financial companies when the US property bub@@ ble explo@@ ded in 2007 .
The US investment bank , Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers , went bel@@ ly up in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis .
The banks batt@@ ling against a strong wind in the USA several years later .
Invest@@ ors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to pun@@ ish mis@@ conduct .
The Federal H@@ ous@@ ing Finance Agency ( F@@ H@@ F@@ A ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .
It acc@@ uses 18 major international banks of having taken in US len@@ ders F@@ ann@@ ie Ma@@ e and Fre@@ d@@ die Mac on mort@@ gage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars .
Deutsche Bank also faces legal action by the F@@ H@@ F@@ A covering multiple transactions with a total value of 14.@@ 2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007 .
The regul@@ ator is demanding that the Frankfur@@ t-@@ based bank take responsibility for &quot; substantial losses , &quot; but has not yet specified the exact sum .
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as bas@@ eless and has declared its intention to f@@ end off the claims .
War@@ ren Buff@@ ett pumps 10 billion into IBM
Financial gur@@ u Buff@@ ett is investing heavily in the IT company , IBM .
Since March , he has bought up shares tot@@ alling more than ten billion dollars .
Until now , the major American investor , War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , had always claimed not to invest in IT and comp@@ uting companies , as it was difficult to forecast the long-term development .
However , IBM &apos;s annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry .
According to Buff@@ ett , he should have realised much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies .
Investment by War@@ ren Buff@@ ett is considered a kni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood in the financial world .
The IT veter@@ an IBM has now earned the title of &quot; Sir IBM . &quot;
Buff@@ ett revealed that he had purchased IBM shares tot@@ alling 10.@@ 7 billion dollars since March on the US business news broad@@ cast@@ er CN@@ BC .
His investment holding company , Ber@@ k@@ shire Ha@@ th@@ away , has become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.@@ 5 percent stake .
Buff@@ ett said that even IBM knew nothing of his involvement until recently .
He pra@@ ised the management , which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis .
&quot; They have done a great job , &quot; said Buff@@ ett , referring to the management strategy .
For a fairly long time , IBM has focused on lu@@ cra@@ tive IT services such as data centres .
The computer pione@@ er - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services , as well as powerful business computers .
Buff@@ ett had avoided technology firms to date .
He claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands
and invested in a freight railway , for example , a lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer .
His holding company , Ber@@ k@@ shire Ha@@ th@@ away , own@@ s shares in a long list of major companies such as Co@@ c@@ a-@@ Col@@ a and Munich R@@ e ( formerly Mün@@ chen@@ er R@@ ück ) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries .
The 8@@ 1-@@ year-old took over the small textile company Ber@@ k@@ shire Ha@@ th@@ away in the 196@@ 0s and built it up , with cle@@ ver investments , into one of the most valuable companies in the world .
His lifestyle , however , has remained hum@@ ble ,
making him a cul@@ t figure for countless investors around the world .
His almost inf@@ alli@@ ble inst@@ inc@@ t for making money has earned him a nick@@ name as the &quot; Oracle from O@@ ma@@ ha . &quot;
The IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of Buff@@ ett &apos;s investment .
&quot; Big Blue , &quot; as IBM is also known , is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft .
Buff@@ ett , however , has said he is not planning to invest in Microsoft .
The founder , Bill Gates , is a close friend .
Im@@ min@@ ent danger
Following the discovery of the &quot; Z@@ wick@@ au cell , &quot; Turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in Germany .
One newspaper speaks of a &quot; bloo@@ dy ideology &quot; that is now res@@ ur@@ facing .
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek business@@ man between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist ideology .
Fe@@ ar and concern has been the reaction to this report in Turkey and within the German-@@ Turkish community in Germany .
For many German Tur@@ ks , the news brings back to life a long-@@ dead spec@@ tre . There has been no comparable right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist violence against Tur@@ ks since the ar@@ son attacks in Mö@@ ll@@ n in November 1992 and in Sol@@ ingen in May 1993 .
There was never any question , however , that xenophobia does exist in Germany .
The right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist network that has now been discovered , however , is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .
&quot; Is this a revi@@ val of the bloo@@ dy ideology ? &quot; was the head@@ line of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Hab@@ er@@ tur@@ k .
The Sab@@ ah newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpet@@ r@@ ators was a confidential inform@@ ant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be caught up in the right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist qu@@ ag@@ mire .
The Turkish Community of Germany ( T@@ G@@ D ) re@@ acted cal@@ mly , remember@@ ing the victims of ra@@ cial violence during a silent vi@@ gi@@ l in front of the Brand@@ enburg Gate at the weekend .
Just two weeks earlier , the Turkish Community in Berlin had commem@@ or@@ ated the fif@@ tieth anniversary of the German-@@ Turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians .
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story .
The coverage by some Turkish media has been like a sla@@ p in the face . &quot; Germany &apos;s present on the fif@@ tieth anniversary &quot; is the title of one article on the H@@ aber X Turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of mur@@ ders .
The German edition of H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet also does not miss the chance to make this connection .
&quot; It is beginning to st@@ ink , &quot; is the title of the column by Ah@@ met Kü@@ la@@ h@@ ci .
He points out that people have been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany &apos;s re@@ development with their work .
The behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful man@@ hun@@ t is heavily criticised on German-@@ Turkish internet forums .
The authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not think earlier to look for sus@@ pects in right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist circles .
Some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . &quot; If things continue to be done so c@@ ack@@ -@@ han@@ de@@ dly , migrants have no option but armed self-@@ defence . &quot;
&quot; That will be the best self-@@ defence . &quot;
&quot; Peace in Germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is un@@ covered and on the appropri@@ at@@ eness of punishment , &quot; writes &quot; Sel@@ en . &quot;
The attacks on Mö@@ ll@@ n and Sol@@ ingen in the 9@@ 0s are an example of what it means for peace in Germany to be at risk .
The photo of the bur@@ nt out ru@@ in of Sol@@ ingen is deeply en@@ gra@@ ined in German and Turkish memory .
No other event has shown the Tur@@ ks living here more clearly that there is im@@ min@@ ent danger and shown the Germans that mi@@ str@@ ust and distance can cul@@ min@@ ate in real violence .
The attacks , however , increased the sense of Turkish unity .
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time compla@@ ined mainly of the failure of German policy following the attacks . Hel@@ mut Koh@@ l dec@@ lined to visit the survi@@ vors in Mö@@ ll@@ n .
He sent a tele@@ gram of c@@ ommis@@ er@@ ation to the Turkish president after the ar@@ son attack in Sol@@ ingen , but it was his foreign minister , Klaus Kin@@ kel , who took his place at the mem@@ orial ceremony in Cologne - Kin@@ kel sum@@ med up in his speech the taxes Tur@@ ks contribute in Germany ,
just as if he were calcul@@ ating the value of a person by the taxes he pays .
The coverage by the Turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mi@@ str@@ ust of many German Tur@@ ks in the current German state has become since .
Stra@@ i@@ ght talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to identify and re@@ assess right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist terrorism in Germany .
The Lake Zurich banking scandal
The most ris@@ k-@@ taking bank in Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland .
U@@ BS almost went bank@@ rupt during the financial crisis and has been stru@@ ggling from one crisis to the next ever since .
A German is now to bring it back in line .
A@@ xel Weber certainly had not ima@@ g@@ ined that would be his role .
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Federal bank , it was announced in July that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013 : Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank U@@ BS - an unexpected and lu@@ cra@@ tive career move .
A@@ xel Weber was clearly delighted , pra@@ ising Switzerland for its beauty and U@@ BS for its newly won soli@@ dity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues .
&quot; U@@ BS has managed to turn around . &quot;
&quot; I am looking forward to working with K@@ asp@@ ar V@@ illi@@ ger and Os@@ wald Grü@@ bel . &quot;
But by September it was already clear that everything would be very different .
A U@@ BS tra@@ der in London had b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed all the bank &apos;s security systems and g@@ amb@@ led away around 1.@@ 7 billion Euros .
U@@ BS CEO , Os@@ wald Grü@@ bel - a ban@@ ker not only famous in Switzerland - had to go .
The U@@ BS Chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking : when will A@@ xel Weber finally arrive ?
Weber is to advise the bank from February 2012 .
And he will take on the role of Chairman of the Board in May , and not in 2013 , the bank announced on Tuesday .
That will be tough for A@@ xel Weber .
He is an economics professor and central ban@@ ker , not a conventional ban@@ ker , and clearly would need some time to adjust .
All at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deser@@ ved the title of &quot; Europe &apos;s biggest banking scandal . &quot;
U@@ BS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been stru@@ ggling from one scandal to the next for years .
The proud Swiss bank , it seems , is to be sp@@ ared nothing .
It began in the financial crisis .
U@@ BS had an excellent reputation until 2007 .
The bank combined the image of the secre@@ tive and solid , but equally sav@@ vy asset manager with ambitious targets , aiming to become a major player in investment banking .
As a result , in 2007 U@@ BS was managing 1.@@ 6 billion , thereby managing more more money from weal@@ thy clients than any other bank in the world ,
and had risen to the le@@ ague of the world &apos;s biggest banks as an investment bank .
That made an impression .
The former ban@@ ker and long-@@ standing banking professor at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich , Hans Gei@@ ger , explains : &quot; I always presented U@@ BS to my students as the model of a good bank . &quot;
&quot; From what we know today , you have to ask how I could be so wrong . &quot;
He was very wrong indeed .
It only became clear in 2007 that something was really going very wrong at U@@ BS .
In the middle of the year , CEO Peter Wu@@ ff@@ li - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant ban@@ ker - suddenly step@@ ped down .
Some months later we could gu@@ ess at why he had left .
The investment division of the bank had g@@ amb@@ led on sub@@ prime securities and was forced to write off billions .
U@@ BS announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 13 billion Swiss fran@@ cs to face the crisis .
The bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many ban@@ kers would have respec@@ t@@ fully dec@@ lined a short while earlier - a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab@@ ic sovereign wealth fund that was so secre@@ tive , even its name was not dis@@ closed .
That was just the first blow .
It got a lot worse in April 2008 .
The bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors , Mar@@ cel O@@ sp@@ el - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - re@@ signed .
Cat@@ astrop@@ he followed in October 2008 . U@@ BS faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state .
The National Bank bought up toxic securities from U@@ BS for un@@ told billions and the Swiss Con@@ federation paid six billion Swiss fran@@ cs for a mandatory con@@ verti@@ ble bond to become part owner of the bank .
The whole of Switzerland was sho@@ cked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .
After all , the balance sheet total for U@@ BS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland ( see chart ) .
&quot; We would not be able to save the U@@ BS for a second time , &quot; says banking resear@@ cher Gei@@ ger .
The second catastrop@@ he followed closely on the he@@ els of the first .
A few months later , U@@ BS capit@@ ulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of weal@@ thy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank .
U@@ BS also agreed to pay 7@@ 80 million dollars consisting of re@@ payment of un@@ justified profits from the business and a penalty .
U@@ BS therefore more or less admitted having been an access@@ ory to tax ev@@ asion .
At the same time , U@@ BS lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fo@@ g of sec@@ rec@@ y .
Swiss banking sec@@ rec@@ y was not the same after the scandal .
The CEO and the Chairman then re@@ signed and
the exo@@ dus of client money began .
The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by ai@@ ding and abet@@ ting tax ev@@ asion .
And just as things had cal@@ med down and U@@ BS looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous ro@@ gue tra@@ der . A single tra@@ der g@@ amb@@ led away 1.@@ 7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong .
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
&quot; The Ado@@ bol@@ i incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little , &quot; says Martin Jan@@ ssen , economic and professor of finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich .
The CF@@ O of one major German bank also has no doubts : &quot; The problem facing U@@ BS is that it does not having a handle on risk control . &quot;
It was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made Swiss ban@@ kers the guar@@ di@@ ans of the world &apos;s major assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine re@@ public or not .
The saf@@ es of Swiss banks had become a symbol of un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able reliability , just as Lin@@ dt and Spr@@ ün@@ gli had come to symboli@@ se sophisticated chocolate .
The U@@ BS headquarters in Zurich still fit the c@@ lich@@ é of the dign@@ i@@ fied Swiss private bank - just a bit bigger .
The location alone is classic .
The bank has its head office on Zurich &apos;s Bahn@@ hof@@ strasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake , surrounded by the sno@@ w-@@ c@@ apped peaks of the Swiss mountains .
The buildings are ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous and the shop rates are among the highest in Europe .
Je@@ well@@ ers such as Ti@@ ff@@ any &apos;s are to be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli .
The Swiss banks have re@@ sided here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Su@@ isse and elite private banks such as Juli@@ us B@@ är .
A heavy revol@@ ving door opens onto the U@@ BS reception .
The walls within are cla@@ d in marble behind vast leather arm@@ chairs . There is a large sign to the &quot; Safe &quot; next to the bank &apos;s logo .
U@@ BS knows that its clients are looking for - security .
But both the major Swiss banks , U@@ BS and Credit Su@@ isse , at some point ou@@ sted the Swiss banking concept - or betra@@ yed it , as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes .
He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too , like all Swiss ban@@ kers , does business with the two major banks .
He believes U@@ BS has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ ons are also very active .
In his opinion , the Swiss have nothing to add .
&quot; And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ ons long ago . &quot;
It was in fact An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ on investment banking that changed U@@ BS , brought in its first big profits - and then the deb@@ ac@@ le . No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub@@ prime jung@@ le as the major Swiss bank .
The catastrop@@ he became evident on 15 October 2008 .
&quot; That Wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million under@@ took the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation , &quot; writes author Lu@@ kas Hä@@ ssig in his book The U@@ BS Cra@@ sh .
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss fran@@ cs ( around 45 billion Euros ) to save the bank from bank@@ rupt@@ cy .
How could it have come to that ?
Tal@@ king to Swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of U@@ BS .
Two of the three major Swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in June 1998 .
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the mer@@ ger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .
The fact that the two banks that went to form U@@ BS comple@@ mented each other helped . One was a weal@@ thy but se@@ date bank speciali@@ sing in asset management in Zurich and the other was less weal@@ thy , but much more internation@@ alised .
The internation@@ alised investment ban@@ kers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an al@@ mi@@ ghty wheel .
Two names are connected with the rise of U@@ BS : Peter Wu@@ ff@@ li , Group CEO of U@@ BS from 2001 to 2007 , and Mar@@ cel O@@ sp@@ el , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
&quot; I always thought that Wu@@ ff@@ li and O@@ sp@@ el were a dream team , &quot; says the banking research , Hans Gei@@ ger .
&quot; Wu@@ ff@@ li , highly intellectual , modest , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and O@@ sp@@ el , with gut inst@@ inc@@ t who had worked his way up from being a ban@@ ker &apos;s ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce . &quot;
But O@@ sp@@ el in the end re@@ lied on Wu@@ ff@@ li .
And Wu@@ ff@@ li ultimately may have made a critical error . &quot; He thought his models were reality , &quot; says Gei@@ ger .
&quot; That is tragic . &quot;
Tra@@ gic it may be .
Pri@@ de comes before a fall .
Emplo@@ ye@@ es of U@@ BS clearly remember the management meetings where CEO Wu@@ ff@@ li always repeated the same s@@ logan - de@@ thr@@ one Gold@@ man Sach@@ s .
The American bank was the world &apos;s most powerful investment bank .
It led the &quot; le@@ ague tables &quot; that documented the success of the banks at that time .
U@@ BS wanted to get to the very top of the le@@ ague .
It managed some of the way .
U@@ BS was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .
Commission@@ ed management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . In terms of what in banking termin@@ ology is referred to as &quot; fixed income , &quot; U@@ BS was far behind the very largest banks .
U@@ BS had gaps in its US mort@@ gage products .
To plug the hole , U@@ BS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence .
Hung@@ ry for growth , the bank itself and a he@@ dge fund founded by the bank invested in US sub@@ prime securities .
It developed into a vast machine that pack@@ aged up securities based on US mort@@ gage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , U@@ BS carried on .
&quot; U@@ BS was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the US housing market was in fl@@ ames , &quot; says banking expert Gei@@ ger .
The greater the rise , the greater the fall .
One manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .
Po@@ sts at U@@ BS became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day .
Any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job .
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .
Banking expert Gei@@ ger already has an idea - qu@@ it investment banking , focus on asset management and turn back to Swiss roots .
The bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
It is clear , nonetheless , that investment banking must shr@@ ink significantly .
The new head of the bank , Ser@@ gio Er@@ mot@@ ti , plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday .
The 5@@ 1-@@ year-old I@@ t@@ alo@@ -S@@ wis@@ s ban@@ ker was actually only ima@@ g@@ ined as a transitional solution when the bank par@@ ted ways un@@ expec@@ tedly with his predecessor Grü@@ bel .
Since then , he has proved his m@@ ett@@ le and is now to head U@@ BS permanently , the Zu@@ rich@@ -based bank announced on Tuesday .
Er@@ mot@@ ti plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-@@ 9@@ 0s .
He is cutting 3@@ 500 jobs .
But that will not be enough .
U@@ BS needs a vision .
What is U@@ BS ?
How does it plan to make money ?
Those are the questions A@@ xel Weber is definitely already asking himself .
Publi@@ c@@ ly , he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in Zurich .
Next year .
Fe@@ ar of recession in Europe de@@ pres@@ ses US stock exchange
The im@@ pending recession in Europe has de@@ pressed the mood of US investors at the start of the week .
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little impact .
Cur@@ bed industrial production on the continent ni@@ pped hopes that the debt crisis might stabili@@ se in the bu@@ d .
The general relief following the change of government in Rome and Athens was not sustained .
The Euro fell against the dollar .
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week , not half empty - now the problems are coming to the fore once again , said Mark Lu@@ sch@@ ini of Jan@@ ney Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery Scott .
Financial stocks in particular were on the sales recei@@ p@@ ts .
The Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage closed business at 12@@ ,@@ 0@@ 78 with a fall of 0.@@ 6 percent .
The market bar@@ ometer fluctu@@ ated between 12@@ ,@@ 0@@ 27 and 12@@ ,@@ 170 points in the course of trading .
The broader S &amp; P 500 index closed at 12@@ 51 point , down one percent .
The Nas@@ da@@ q Technology Index lost 0.@@ 8 percent and closed trading at 26@@ 57 points .
In Frankfurt , the Da@@ x fell 1.2 percent closing at 5@@ 9@@ 85 points .
Industry in the 17 Euro countries has significantly reduced production and is adju@@ sting to the end of the up@@ turn .
The Eurostat statistics office announced that , in September , companies produced two percent less than in the previous month .
The announcement made US investors scep@@ tical . &quot; We are not an island . We are dependent , &quot; said Steve Gold@@ man of Gold@@ man Management .
He also claimed that Europe is not likely to sha@@ ke off a recession quickly and that there are further signs of weakness in the banks .
The investment legend , War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , could only support such caution . In a CN@@ BC interview , he said that it was not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis .
In his opinion , it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks .
Instead , Buff@@ ett thre@@ w a dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ old principle out of the window to invest in the US technology industry .
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boo@@ sted the veter@@ an company &apos;s share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading .

Buff@@ ett claims to have paid 170 dollars on average per share and now has a 5.@@ 5 percent stake .
The share price of his investment company Ber@@ k@@ shire Ha@@ th@@ away fell 1.3 percent .

Intel@@ ligent cro@@ ws are spreading in cities
Roo@@ ks are considered problem birds in many places . Exper@@ ts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities .
Some like the birds , others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible . Cro@@ ws have been part of the cit@@ y@@ scape for hundreds of years , but residents compla@@ ining about the fil@@ th and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities .
A solution to the problem birds , however , is far from within reach .
Exper@@ ts at the first cro@@ w sym@@ posi@@ um in the East Fri@@ sian town of Le@@ er have said that ro@@ o@@ ks can no longer be forced out of cities .
Speci@@ alists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions .
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Con@@ serv@@ ation@@ ists stated that migration of specially protected ro@@ o@@ ks was the root of the problem in cities , pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habit@@ ats .
Hun@@ ting , increasing development and f@@ elling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the birds .
Cro@@ ws are protected .
There are large colon@@ ies with more than 600 breeding pa@@ irs in the West@@ p@@ ha@@ lian town of So@@ est and in the north-@@ west in Je@@ ver , Die@@ ph@@ olz , Ach@@ im bei Bremen and Le@@ er .
A controversial project to cul@@ l cro@@ ws in Le@@ er was behind negative head@@ lines in 2005 .
Cri@@ tics described the capture of the birds in bird tra@@ ps and how they were be@@ aten to death with clubs as particularly brutal .
&quot; Nor@@ mal displac@@ ement and deter@@ rence does nothing , &quot; said town and country plann@@ er Werner K@@ lö@@ ver from Le@@ er .
Spra@@ ying off ne@@ sts with water or f@@ elling trees often has un@@ desired consequences , said environment expert Man@@ fred Kaiser from L@@ ahr in Baden-@@ Wür@@ ttem@@ berg .
&quot; The animals disp@@ er@@ se and large colon@@ ies split up and spread to other areas . &quot;
De@@ ter@@ rence would only be concei@@ vable as an exception in hospitals , retirement homes and schools .
&quot; We have to live with them . Get@@ ting rid of them is not an option . &quot;
Without the surrounding area , the problem in the cities will not be solved , said Le@@ er &apos;s may@@ or , Wolfgang K@@ ell@@ ner .
A combination of deter@@ ring birds from sensitive residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option .
&quot; Information boards instead of chain sa@@ ws &quot; was the s@@ logan proposed by the psych@@ ologist and ethn@@ ologist U@@ ta Maria Jür@@ gens , who argued for a totally different approach to the birds . &quot; We should have the self-@@ confidence to live with this problem . &quot;
Jür@@ gens was a co-@@ founder of the A@@ sch@@ er@@ berg cro@@ w educational trail in Sch@@ les@@ wi@@ g-@@ Hol@@ stein , where notice boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent ro@@ ok .
The project is already attrac@@ ting interest from tourists .
Jür@@ gens also expressed her opinion on the criticism of the noise the birds make . &quot; The noise conve@@ ys a lot of information . They have a lot to say to each other . &quot;
The intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary . Roo@@ ks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice mor@@ sel , but create tools themselves .
Beh@@ avi@@ ou@@ ral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the extent of the birds &quot; intelligence on four ro@@ o@@ ks .
In one experiment , the birds quickly learnt that they had to kno@@ ck over a platform to get to a mo@@ th lar@@ va .
They recognised the size and shape of stone needed to collapse the platform without much training .
In a second experiment , the cann@@ y cro@@ ws had to solve a tri@@ ck@@ ier problem .
The researchers put a small bu@@ cket with a mo@@ th lar@@ va in a vertical cy@@ linder .
The birds could not reach their pre@@ y with their be@@ aks .
However , the researchers had provided pieces of wire .
All four birds used the wire to form a ho@@ ok and used the ho@@ ok to fish the bu@@ cket out of the tube by its handle .
Three of the four ro@@ o@@ ks even managed it at the first attempt .
Ron@@ al@@ do ro@@ ckets Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosni@@ ans and Tur@@ ks for a last minute win were short-@@ lived .
The favou@@ rites Portugal , Croatia and the Czech Republic , plus Ireland , will be at the 2012 European champ@@ ionship .
Portugal , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Ireland have got the final spots for the Euro 2012 champ@@ ionship in Poland and Ukraine .
L@@ ed by super@@ star C@@ ris@@ ti@@ ano Ron@@ al@@ do who sco@@ red in the 8th and 5@@ 3rd minutes , Portugal beat Bosni@@ a-@@ Herzegovina 6 : 2 ( 2 : 1 ) , round@@ ing off their fifth Euro appearance perfectly after 0 : 0 in the first leg .
The Cze@@ chs only needed 1 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) in the pla@@ yo@@ ff second leg against out@@ si@@ der Montenegro after a clear win in the first leg ( 2 : 0 ) .
Croatia did not miss a tri@@ ck with 0 : 0 against Turkey and Ireland managed an easy 1 : 1 ( 1 : 0 ) against Estonia .
N@@ ani ( 24@@ th minute ) , Hel@@ der Po@@ sti@@ ga ( 7@@ 2nd and 8@@ 2nd ) and Miguel Vel@@ o@@ so ( 80@@ th ) sco@@ red the other goals for Portugal .
The former Wol@@ fs@@ burg Bundes@@ lig@@ a professional Z@@ v@@ je@@ z@@ dan Mi@@ si@@ mo@@ vic and cap@@ tain E@@ mir Spa@@ hi@@ c even@@ ed the score with a converted 4@@ 1@@ st-@@ minute penalty and a goal in the 6@@ 5th for Bosnia .
Sen@@ a Lu@@ lic got a second yellow card in the 5@@ 4th minute .
Bosnia had already been kno@@ cked out of the World Cup 2010 play@@ off@@ s in South Africa against Portugal .
Portugal got off to a perfect start in Lisbon &apos;s E@@ sta@@ dio da Lu@@ z .
Ron@@ al@@ do po@@ unded a free k@@ ick into the nets from about 30 meters to take an early lead .
A good quarter of an hour later , N@@ ani displayed his long-@@ range abilities , raising the lead to 2 : 0 from the 25 met@@ re line .
The Bosni@@ ans , with no opening in the first half hour , had their first opportunity with goal sc@@ orer Edi@@ n D@@ z@@ ek@@ o .
The former Wol@@ fs@@ burg player from the English champ@@ ionship leader Manchester City put a he@@ ader onto the bottom edge of the cross@@ bar in the 3@@ 3rd minute , but the ball did not go over the goal line .
Ji@@ rac@@ ek scores for the Czech Republic
The refer@@ ee Wolfgang Star@@ k from Er@@ gol@@ ding then gar@@ n@@ ered some attention .
Following an attack on Hel@@ der Po@@ sti@@ ga in the Bosni@@ an penalty area in the 36@@ th minute , Star@@ k decided the Portuguese player had simul@@ ated and gave him a yellow card .
Star@@ k also awarded a controversial penalty for hand@@ ball after a f@@ oul by Fab@@ io Co@@ ent@@ ra@@ o - Mi@@ si@@ mo@@ vic converted .
After half-@@ time , the vic@@ e-@@ European champ@@ ions of 2004 settled the score with four more goals .
Pet@@ r Ji@@ rac@@ ek cle@@ ared up any remaining doubt for the Cze@@ chs in the 8@@ 1st minute .
The European champ@@ ions of 1976 are going to the Euro Championship for the fifth time in a row .
Lu@@ ck also sm@@ iled on tra@@ iner Mich@@ al Bi@@ le@@ k &apos;s team and Bundes@@ lig@@ a legi@@ on@@ aries Michael K@@ ad@@ le@@ c ( Ba@@ yer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en ) and T@@ omas P@@ ek@@ hart ( 1st FC N@@ ure@@ m@@ berg ) with a potentially catastrop@@ hi@@ c error early on .
Go@@ ali@@ e Pet@@ r Ce@@ ch prevented a potential own goal from T@@ omas Si@@ vo@@ k in the 9th minute with a spli@@ t-@@ second refle@@ x .
Montenegro had its best opportunities when the Ste@@ van Jo@@ ve@@ tic and De@@ jan Dam@@ j@@ ano@@ vic du@@ o were on the field .
Dam@@ j@@ ano@@ vic took a shot from the edge of the penalty area that just missed Ce@@ ch &apos;s goal in the 40@@ th minute .
After half-@@ time , the cross@@ bar saved the Cze@@ chs &quot; already bat@@ tered world-@@ class go@@ ali@@ e after the forward from FC Se@@ oul re@@ treated in the 50@@ th minute .
The winning goal was sco@@ red just before full-@@ time .
Turkey , mean@@ while , was lacking football geni@@ us in Zagreb .
Four days after losing 0 : 3 in Istanbul , the Tur@@ ks could do no better than a 0 : 0 draw in Zagreb .
While it is now virtually a certainty that national tra@@ iner Gu@@ us Hi@@ dd@@ ink must now give up his place on the ben@@ ch of the team that reached third place in 2002 , the Croati@@ ans are through to the final round of a European champ@@ ionship for the fourth time .
The Tur@@ ks almost managed the perfect start in front of 3@@ 1,000 spec@@ t@@ ators at the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium .
Sel@@ cu@@ k In@@ an &apos;s long-@@ range shot hit the post in the sevent@@ h minute and stri@@ ker Kaz@@ im Kaz@@ im was unable to put the re@@ bound into the net .
Croatia then wo@@ ke up , taking more and more control of the game .
The Croati@@ ans continued in fine form after half-@@ time .
The Bu@@ des@@ lig@@ a legi@@ on@@ aries Dan@@ ij@@ el P@@ ran@@ j@@ ic ( Bayern Munich ) and Gord@@ on Schil@@ den@@ feld ( Ein@@ tra@@ cht Frankfurt ) were on the field alongside Mario Mand@@ zu@@ k@@ ic from V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , who made space for I@@ van Peri@@ sic from Dor@@ t@@ mund from the 6@@ 2nd minute .
Tra@@ p@@ att@@ oni going to Euro 2012
The Irish in Dublin were celeb@@ rating their first appearance at the European champ@@ ionship since 1988 in Germany .
Trainer Giovanni Tra@@ p@@ att@@ oni &apos;s team - already looking assured of a place following the 4 : 0 victory in the first leg - took the lead in the 3@@ 2nd minute thanks to a goal from Stephen W@@ ard .
Kon@@ stanti@@ n V@@ assi@@ l@@ je@@ v e@@ quali@@ sed for the away team in the 5@@ 7th minute .
Ireland kept up the pace , but had to wait until the 23@@ rd minute when Rob@@ bie Ke@@ ane from Los Angeles had the first clean shot on goal .
The Est@@ onian re@@ ar@@ guard prevented him at the last moment from taking Ireland into the lead .
The goal came in the 3@@ 2nd minute .
After a failed defence by go@@ ali@@ e P@@ av@@ el Lon@@ dak , W@@ ard was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to bring the score to 1 : 0 .

SAP plans to double workforce in China
Europe &apos;s largest software producer , SAP , plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years .
The Da@@ x-@@ listed company announced on Tuesday that around two billion dollars ( around 1.5 billion Euros ) is to be invested by 2015 .
&quot; We will create more research and development facilities and hire thousands of people , &quot; Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , co-@@ chief executive of SAP , said in a statement at a consumer show in Peking .

M@@ ass S@@ lau@@ ghter on a Personal Level
Peter Eng@@ l@@ und &apos;s intense and bi@@ gh@@ ear@@ ted new book , &quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row : An In@@ timate History of the First World War , &quot; begins with a long dramati@@ s person@@ ae of the sort that can make your heart s@@ ink .
Here is advice for proce@@ eding : G@@ ently exc@@ ise this page and make it your book@@ mark .
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und &apos;s nov@@ eli@@ stic telling , and this dramati@@ s person@@ ae will function as your GPS , a be@@ acon during those few moments when , like one of his men and women , you are confused and ber@@ e@@ ft in the fo@@ g of war .
Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und is a Swedish hist@@ orian and journalist .
He is also the new permanent secre@@ tary of the Swedish Academy , which awards the Nobel Prize in Liter@@ ature .
What he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not in@@ accurately , as &quot; a work of anti-@@ history . &quot;
It contains few big names , major treaties or famous batt@@ les ; there are almost no amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , d@@ ash@@ ing journalists or discussions of tac@@ tics and mater@@ iel .
It &apos;s not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as &quot; a book about what it was like . &quot; It &apos;s about &quot; feelings , impres@@ sions , experiences and mo@@ ods . &quot;
&quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row &quot; th@@ reads together the war@@ time experiences of 20 more or less un@@ remarkable men and women , on both sides of the war , from school@@ girls and bot@@ an@@ ists to mountain clim@@ bers , doctors , amb@@ ul@@ ance drivers and c@@ ler@@ ks .
A few of these people will become her@@ oes .
A few will become prisoners of war , or lose lim@@ bs , go mad or die .
Their lives fli@@ cker here like vo@@ tive cand@@ les ligh@@ ted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some w@@ ink out .
Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und &apos;s book is a devi@@ ation from standard history books .
It is a correc@@ tive too to the notion that World War I was only about the di@@ re tren@@ ch war@@ fare on the Western Front .
&quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row &quot; exper@@ tly p@@ ans across other theat@@ ers of war : the Alps , the Balkans , the Eastern Front , Mes@@ o@@ pot@@ am@@ ia , East Africa .
Sol@@ di@@ ers in this book have be@@ eh@@ i@@ ves fall on them ; one has Christmas in Egypt under the py@@ rami@@ ds ; ts@@ et@@ se f@@ lies are an in@@ trac@@ table problem .
This is a moving book , almost from the start .
War floods these people &apos;s lives like a natural catastrop@@ he , a Hur@@ ri@@ cane Kat@@ rin@@ a that re@@ eks of cor@@ di@@ te .
When cann@@ on fire is heard in the distance , and you are a woman at home with your children , do you stay or fle@@ e ?
Who is coming , anyway ?
Almost no one understands what &apos;s happening , even why this war is to be fought .
&quot; L@@ ack of facts , &quot; Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und ob@@ serves , &quot; has been p@@ added out with gu@@ esses , sup@@ positions , hopes , fears , id@@ ées fixes , con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories , dreams , night@@ ma@@ res and rum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row &quot; follows individuals like Florence Far@@ m@@ bor@@ ough , an English nur@@ se in the Russian Army , and Richard St@@ ump@@ f , a young German high-@@ seas fleet seam@@ an .
Their stories are mostly taken from mem@@ o@@ irs , letters and other already published material .
The accounts of their lives can be terri@@ fying or stir@@ ring , but are most fully alive in Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und &apos;s accum@@ ulation of small moments , stra@@ y details .
Many of these are about de@@ priv@@ ation and making do .
In telling a German school@@ girl &apos;s story he says : &quot; Ersatz , everywhere er@@ satz . &quot;
&quot; Sub@@ stitute coffee , fa@@ ke al@@ umin@@ um , im@@ itation rubber , paper ban@@ da@@ ges , wooden buttons . &quot;
He goes on about the er@@ satz food in Germany .
He describes &quot; meat made of pressed rice bo@@ iled in mut@@ ton fat ( and finished off with a fa@@ ke bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dri@@ ed roots and dri@@ ed pot@@ ato pe@@ el ; shoes sol@@ ed with wood . &quot;
There are , he notes , &quot; 8@@ 37 registered meat sub@@ stitutes per@@ missible in the production of s@@ aus@@ ages , 5@@ 11 registered coffee sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
Some stories are about honor and bra@@ very .
One American recogn@@ izes his own impul@@ se toward sav@@ ag@@ ery and decla@@ res about war : &quot; You feel that , after all , this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigare@@ tte and wh@@ is@@ key , the evening paper or the best seller , and to pre@@ tend that such a vene@@ er means civili@@ zation and that there is no bar@@ b@@ arian behind your star@@ ched and stu@@ d@@ ded shirt front . &quot;
Conver@@ sely a British soldi@@ er reali@@ zes that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
&quot; Once one is re@@ signed to the thought of sacri@@ fic@@ ing on@@ es@@ elf , one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience , &quot; he writes .
Instead , it is horri@@ bly like &quot; a condemned man being stran@@ g@@ led secre@@ tly . &quot;
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away , and about new types of terror .
&quot; The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , &quot; Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und writes , &quot; a war between factories . &quot;
He cat@@ ches the arrival of what he calls &quot; a new species in the besti@@ ary of the young century : the artic@@ ulate and ide@@ ologically convinced mass mur@@ derer in well-@@ cut clothes who perform@@ s his but@@ cher@@ y while sitting behind a desk . &quot;
People be@@ have in un@@ anticipated ways ; there is as much base behavior as hero@@ ism .
Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a ven@@ ere@@ al disease from pro@@ stitutes as a way to ev@@ ade service at the front .
&quot; The most gro@@ tes@@ que expression of this can be seen in the trade of gon@@ o@@ co@@ cc@@ al p@@ us , which soldiers buy and sme@@ ar into their gen@@ it@@ als in the hope of ending up in hospital , &quot; he writes .
&quot; Those who are really desper@@ ate ru@@ b it into their eyes , which often results in lifelong blin@@ dness . &quot;
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Gra@@ ves , Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und &apos;s pro@@ se is supp@@ le but un@@ show@@ y , perfectly suited to his humane task .
In doz@@ ens of small scenes he cat@@ ches the way the war has &quot; un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed uniqu@@ ely un@@ controll@@ able forces : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hat@@ red . &quot;
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight .
The best books about World War I have often been obli@@ que , like Paul F@@ us@@ sell &apos;s &quot; Great War and Modern Memory , &quot; or no@@ vels , like E@@ rich Maria Rem@@ ar@@ que &apos;s &quot; All Qu@@ iet on the Western Front , &quot; rather than comprehensive hist@@ ories .
Mr. Eng@@ l@@ und &apos;s volume jo@@ ins an un@@ conventional pan@@ the@@ on .
His book has the most devastating ending I can remember in a piece of non@@ fiction .
I won &apos;t give it away .
But it &apos;s as if he has reached from his book , s@@ nat@@ ched that dramati@@ s person@@ ae page from your f@@ ing@@ ers , and ligh@@ ted it with a match .
After an Ear@@ lier Mis@@ step , a Min@@ utely Plan@@ ned Ra@@ id
H@@ und@@ reds of police officers were involved , some of them wearing ri@@ ot hel@@ m@@ ets .
The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti Park would be at its emp@@ ti@@ est .
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-@@ ranking officers , with others initially being told that they were emb@@ ark@@ ing on an exercise .
Police Commissioner Ra@@ y@@ mond W. Kel@@ ly was at the center , his presence under@@ sc@@ oring how the operation was frau@@ ght with challenges for the Police Department .
There could be no repeat of ep@@ iso@@ des in recent weeks , like the pe@@ p@@ per@@ -@@ spra@@ ying of prote@@ sters , that violated department rules and created a fi@@ restor@@ m of public sympathy for the squ@@ at@@ ters .
And so the police operation to clear Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti Park of prote@@ sters un@@ fol@@ ded after two weeks of planning and training .
Off@@ ici@@ als had prepared by watching how occup@@ ations in other cities played out .
A major disaster dri@@ ll was held on Rand@@ alls Island , with an eye toward Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti .
Off@@ ici@@ als increased so-called dis@@ order training - counter@@ terrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on Lower Manhattan .
The last training session was on Monday night , on the Manhattan side of the East River .
The orders to move into the park came down at the &quot; last minute , &quot; said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assign@@ ment only as &quot; an exercise . &quot;
&quot; The few cop@@ s that I know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti Park , &quot; said the person , who spoke on the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity .
&quot; The only people who were aware of them going into Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti Park were at the very highest levels of the department . &quot;
One reason for the sec@@ rec@@ y was a lesson learned by the city .
On Oc@@ t@@ . 14 , officials wanted to clear the park , but then backed off as hundreds of prote@@ sters stre@@ amed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans .
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units , including bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ wide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-@@ crime neighbor@@ hoods .
Mr. Kel@@ ly said many people , almost like comm@@ uters , had been coming and going from the park during the day , making 1 a.m. a good time to move in .
&quot; It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , &quot; he said .
Emer@@ gency Service Unit trucks with k@@ lie@@ g lights and lou@@ d@@ speakers gathered at Pi@@ ke Sli@@ p and the Frank@@ lin D. Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t Drive , near the Manhattan Bridge , before moving out .
The lights and pr@@ er@@ ec@@ orded messages bo@@ oming from the lou@@ d@@ speakers seemed to cow many prote@@ sters .
As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their ligh@@ t-@@ blue wind@@ break@@ ers , many prote@@ sters simply gathered their bel@@ ong@@ ings and left .
No t@@ ents were touched until 1 : 45 a.m. , the police said , giving the prote@@ sters time to gather their bel@@ ong@@ ings .
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the per@@ im@@ eter to move in if arre@@ sts were needed in the park .
Re@@ por@@ ters in the park were forced to leave .
Paul J. Brow@@ ne , the Police Department &apos;s chief spo@@ kes@@ man , said it was for their safety .
But many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
Mr. Brow@@ ne said television camera trucks on Church Street , along the park &apos;s western border , were able to capture images .
As the police moved west through the den@@ se tan@@ gle of prote@@ sters &quot; personal bel@@ ong@@ ings , including luggage and plastic la@@ wn and lea@@ f bags stu@@ ff@@ ed with clothing , cre@@ ws from the San@@ itation Department followed , sco@@ op@@ ing up what was left behind .
Some prote@@ sters who refused to move were dra@@ gged out , the images appearing on the Internet soon after .
A core group of prote@@ sters took up positions close to the en@@ camp@@ ment &apos;s kitchen area , near the center of the park .
Some made a barrier , and the police moved in to metho@@ di@@ cally arrest them .
About 10 people in the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the en@@ camp@@ ment locked themselves together by their arms .
And two people cha@@ ined themselves to trees , Mr. Kel@@ ly said .
Emer@@ gency service officers were called in to cut the lo@@ cks .
No arre@@ sts were made in the park until about 3 : 30 a.m. , Mr. Kel@@ ly said .
The cle@@ aring operation was complete about 75 minutes later , the police said .
Mr. Brow@@ ne said about 142 people were arrested in the park .
Most of the arre@@ sts were for &quot; dis@@ or@@ derly conduct and resi@@ sting arrest , &quot; he said .
The high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Es@@ posi@@ to , the chief of department , the top uni@@ formed officer in the department .
Phi@@ l T. Pul@@ as@@ ki , the department &apos;s chief of dete@@ c@@ tives , was also there .
Mr. Kel@@ ly , while present , was &quot; not direc@@ ting operations , &quot; Mr. Brow@@ ne said .
A second group of officers wa@@ ited along the eastern side of Broad@@ way , between Liber@@ ty and C@@ ed@@ ar Stre@@ ets , in case they had to move in .
Barri@@ ca@@ des were set up at Cor@@ t@@ land@@ t Street , a block north of the park , and at P@@ ine Street , a block south .
From those positions , the police were seen expanding the per@@ im@@ eter even far@@ ther out@@ ward from Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti Park .
At one point , several officers , many with shi@@ el@@ ds , were seen pushing people far@@ ther out .
About 28 people were on the northern per@@ im@@ eter .
Some of the ro@@ w@@ dies@@ t action of the night took place south of the park .
Around 5 a.m. , south of P@@ ine Street , one prote@@ ster j@@ ump@@ ed on the hood of a police car , and others were seen rele@@ asing the air from the ti@@ res of a police van .
At one point , a piece of pl@@ y@@ wood came flying from the crowd .
In the end , one officer and one prote@@ ster were hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
Support Wor@@ kers &apos; Union Will Su@@ e City Over Lay@@ off@@ s
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to su@@ e the city on Wednesday , claiming the lay@@ off@@ s were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their dis@@ proportionate impact on schools that serve poor students .
The law@@ suit is possibly the last weapon available to the union , District Council 37 , in its effort to reverse the lay@@ off@@ s .
Six hundred sevent@@ y-@@ two school ai@@ des , parent coordin@@ ators and other employees who were among the city &apos;s lowest paid lost their jobs on Oc@@ t@@ . 7 , in a move union leaders have described as political pay@@ back for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring .
City officials have categ@@ or@@ ically denied that accus@@ ation .
At a City Council hearing last month , Scho@@ ols Chancellor D@@ enn@@ is M. Wal@@ cot@@ t said the lay@@ off@@ s were a part of the budget they signed off on in June .
One council member fi@@ red back , telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off .
District Council 37 officials said they filed a notice of claim , warning the Department of Education that it would be su@@ ed ; it will hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce the law@@ suit &apos;s fil@@ ing formally , in State Supreme Court in Manhattan .
The suit will list Mr. Wal@@ cot@@ t and the city &apos;s Department of Education as defen@@ dants , and counts eight la@@ i@@ d-@@ off workers as pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs , all of them black or Lat@@ ino women , as were most of the ai@@ des who lost their jobs .
Eli@@ za@@ beth Thomas , a spo@@ kes@@ woman for the city &apos;s Law Department , said the city had not seen the law@@ suit and therefore could not comment on its specific alleg@@ ations .
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times , the union has zer@@ o@@ ed in on the number of lay@@ off@@ s at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of ine@@ qu@@ itable treatment , saying poor schools lost more ai@@ des because they had been chron@@ ically under@@ financed .
It points out that while there were no lay@@ off@@ s on St@@ aten Island and few lay@@ off@@ s in schools in the Upper East Si@@ de or Tri@@ Be@@ C@@ a , 17 school ai@@ des lost their jobs in District 23 in Bro@@ wn@@ s@@ ville , Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , and 46 were let go in Distri@@ cts 8 and 9 in the South Bron@@ x .
Not@@ ing the loss of five out of eight school ai@@ des employed by Public School 36 in Har@@ lem , where 68 percent of the students live in poverty , the law@@ suit says , &quot; This is not a neighborhood of well-@@ he@@ eled parents who can fund@@ -@@ raise to make up the budget short@@ falls . &quot;
P.@@ S. 36 &quot; s budget was cut by 3.@@ 26 percent this year , and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calcul@@ ates the extra financing for each poor student schools en@@ roll .
The union also claims that high school princip@@ als may have been mis@@ led by the language in a mem@@ o authori@@ zing the dis@@ miss@@ al of parent coordin@@ ators .
The mem@@ o used the word &quot; excess &quot; to describe the action , even though &quot; excess &quot; more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school &apos;s pay@@ roll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .
&quot; Six@@ ty-@@ six parent coordin@@ ators were laid off , &quot; the draft complaint says , &quot; and not merely exc@@ essed . &quot;
Mission over , Congress ready to agree on Libya
It finally looks like Republi@@ cans and Democrats on Cap@@ it@@ ol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the u@@ pris@@ ing in Libya .
All it took was for the revol@@ t to succeed , long@@ time dict@@ ator Mo@@ amm@@ ar Gad@@ da@@ fi to be captured and killed and American involvement to end .
On Tuesday , the Sen@@ ate Foreign Relations Committee is to consider a resolution , spon@@ sored by Chairman John Ker@@ ry ( D-@@ M@@ ass . ) , along with Sens@@ . John Mc@@ C@@ ain ( R-@@ Ari@@ z . ) and Joseph I. Lie@@ ber@@ man ( I-@@ Con@@ n . ) , applau@@ ding Liby@@ ans for their successful re@@ bel@@ lion and U.S. troops for their &quot; bra@@ very . &quot;
&quot; This resolution is about hon@@ oring the coura@@ geous people of Libya as they begin to re@@ build their country , &quot; Ker@@ ry said .
&quot; It &apos;s an affir@@ mation of bi@@ parti@@ san support for their democratic aspirations . &quot;
The language may sound inno@@ cu@@ ous , but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far .
This summer , law@@ makers from both parties squ@@ ab@@ b@@ led with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or dis@@ approve of the U.S. military &apos;s role in the NATO mission in Libya .
In June , Ker@@ ry and Mc@@ C@@ ain introduced a resolution authori@@ zing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya .
The bill was defe@@ ated in the House by a wide bi@@ parti@@ san margin , and it never came up for a vote in the Sen@@ ate .
But on the same day that bill failed in the House , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya .
That left the U.S. mission in a form of legislative pur@@ g@@ atory - with Congress up@@ set enough to critici@@ ze Obama &apos;s handling of the mission but not so an@@ gr@@ y as to actually pull the rug out from under it .
Then Congress &apos;s in@@ decision was over@@ taken by events .
Tri@@ pol@@ i fell to Liby@@ an reb@@ els in August , and Gad@@ da@@ fi was killed Oc@@ t@@ . 20 .
The NATO mission officially ended Oc@@ t@@ . 31 .
Now the Sen@@ ate may be ready to act .
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution &quot; congratul@@ ates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resi@@ li@@ ence in liber@@ ating themselves &quot; and &quot; comm@@ ends the men and women of the United States Ar@@ med For@@ ces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bra@@ very and professionalism . &quot;
The resolution also &quot; affir@@ ms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irre@@ ver@@ sible transition to democracy in Libya . &quot;
Will the new measure earn the full support of the Foreign Relations panel , or will it split law@@ makers like the June bill did ?
The last version was opposed by Sen@@ . Richard G. Lu@@ gar ( In@@ d . ) , the committee &apos;s top Republi@@ can .
Lu@@ gar &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet .
A@@ cross the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the House is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget , a top legislative priority of nearly every con@@ gres@@ sional Republi@@ can and some Democrats .
The measure , spon@@ sored by Rep@@ . Bo@@ b Goo@@ d@@ lat@@ te ( R-@@ V@@ a . ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the House or Sen@@ ate this Congress .
Other law@@ makers have been un@@ successful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor , but not for lack of trying .
Goo@@ d@@ lat@@ te &apos;s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this Congress , spann@@ ing a wide range of topics .
Some are duplic@@ ates - the same bill offered in both the House and Sen@@ ate - and others are slight variations on each other .
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone , and another hand@@ ful that would &quot; control federal spending . &quot;
Some of those b@@ ills are identical too , but they give their spon@@ sors - particularly fresh@@ men Republi@@ cans looking to bur@@ nis@@ h their resu@@ mes - the chance to bra@@ g that they &quot; au@@ tho@@ red &quot; such a measure .
The Budget Control Act , which passed in August , required that both the House and Sen@@ ate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
In March , 58 sen@@ ators voted in favor of a non-@@ binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment .
Beyond the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve , while Rep@@ . José E. Ser@@ ran@@ o ( D-@@ N@@ .@@ Y@@ . ) wants to lift the two-@@ term limit for pre@@ sidents .
Rep@@ . J@@ esse L. Jackson J@@ r . ( D-@@ I@@ ll . ) has offered a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects .
An amendment prohi@@ bit@@ ing sam@@ e-@@ sex marriage is a per@@ enni@@ al offering , as is one prohi@@ bit@@ ing fla@@ g-@@ burning .
Some law@@ makers also want to allow for the n@@ ul@@ li@@ fication of federal laws if they are opposed by two-@@ thirds of the states .
As e@@ ager as members have been to offer amendments , they &apos;re not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
In the 11@@ 1@@ th Congress , law@@ makers offered 77 such amendments , and they introduced 66 in the 1@@ 10th .
The pace p@@ ales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years , according to numbers provided by the Sen@@ ate Library .
But they weren &apos;t much more successful then than they are now .
The last amendment to be added - the 27@@ th - was ratified in 1992 , but it was actually proposed by Congress in 17@@ 89 .
&quot; Be@@ at up but not be@@ aten , &quot; Gi@@ ff@@ ords speaks in first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gun@@ man shot her at poin@@ t-@@ blan@@ k range at a constitu@@ ent event in Tu@@ c@@ son , Rep@@ . Gabri@@ elle Gi@@ ff@@ for@@ ds ( D-@@ Ari@@ z . ) appeared on national television Monday night , s@@ ang along to the Broad@@ way show tune &quot; The Sun Will Come Out Tom@@ orrow &quot; and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to Congress .
Ap@@ pe@@ aring on AB@@ C News &apos;s &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; with Di@@ ane Sa@@ w@@ yer , Gi@@ ff@@ ords stru@@ gg@@ led to formed sentences and needed help walking .
The show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inf@@ lic@@ ted by a bul@@ let that fra@@ c@@ tured her sk@@ ull and p@@ ier@@ ced the left side of her brain , passing from the front to the back of her head .
Three months ago , she made a surprise return to the House to tri@@ um@@ ph@@ antly cast her vote on the deb@@ t-@@ ceiling deal .
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six and wo@@ unded 13 , Gi@@ ff@@ ords sm@@ iled , lau@@ gh@@ ed and s@@ ang - and described her recovery as &quot; difficult . &quot;
A@@ sk@@ ed by Sa@@ w@@ yer how she feels , Gi@@ ff@@ ords , 41 , responded , &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty good . &quot;
The interview with Gi@@ ff@@ ords and her husband , a@@ stron@@ aut Mark Kel@@ ly , was part of an h@@ our-@@ long &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; special that ai@@ red on the eve of the release of the couple &apos;s new book , &quot; Gab@@ by : A St@@ ory of Cou@@ rage and H@@ ope . &quot;
The special tra@@ ced Gi@@ ff@@ ords &apos;s recovery since the Jan@@ . 8 shooting .
In videos shot by Kel@@ ly in the first few weeks , she is seen in her hospital bed , her head sha@@ ved and a long scar across her fore@@ head .
She is capable only of holding up one or two f@@ ing@@ ers as her husband encourages her .
Mon@@ ths later , Gi@@ ff@@ ords is seen sitting up in a whe@@ el@@ chair as therap@@ ists teach her how to perform simple actions .
A no@@ d of the head .
A pu@@ cker of the li@@ ps .
And then , her first word : &quot; What . &quot;
Within days , Gi@@ ff@@ ords ut@@ tered another word - &quot; to@@ ast , &quot; a request for a change in her breakfast menu .
Videos ai@@ red by AB@@ C show that music played a central role in Gi@@ ff@@ ords &apos;s recovery : The con@@ gress@@ woman is seen singing along with therap@@ ists to C@@ yn@@ di Lau@@ per &apos;s &quot; Gir@@ ls Just W@@ anna Have F@@ un &quot; and Tom Pet@@ ty &apos;s &quot; Free Fal@@ lin . &quot; &quot;
In the interview with Sa@@ w@@ yer , Gi@@ ff@@ ords , who goes through two hours of therapy every day , said she has no memory of the day of the shooting .
Her husband said that he was reading Gi@@ ff@@ ords a newspaper story about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed in the incident .
Sus@@ pec@@ ted gun@@ man J@@ ared Lee Lou@@ gh@@ ner is being held at a Miss@@ our@@ i prison and is being for@@ ci@@ bly medic@@ ated as he awaits trial .
&quot; A lot of people died , &quot; Gi@@ ff@@ ords told Sa@@ w@@ yer .
&quot; T@@ ough , tough , tough . &quot;
At one point in his wife &apos;s recovery , Kel@@ ly told Sa@@ w@@ yer , she said , &quot; I &apos;ve been be@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; So , I would say , &quot; Gab@@ by , you have not been be@@ aten , &quot; &quot; Kel@@ ly said .
You &apos;ve just been beat up .
And you &apos;re going to get through this , and you &apos;re going to recover and you &apos;re going to come back stronger than ever .
Tro@@ ops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street g@@ ala that raised millions of dollars for hom@@ eless veter@@ ans in New York City .
K@@ id Rock s@@ ang a bal@@ la@@ d about hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , fru@@ stration and loss .
On cu@@ e , several hundred soldiers , sail@@ ors , air@@ men and Mar@@ ines stro@@ de into position around him .
The black@@ -@@ tie crowd rose to its feet and che@@ ered .
&quot; The servi@@ c@@ emen and women were regarded as her@@ oes , &quot; said David Sal@@ tz@@ man , who organized the spring fund@@ ra@@ iser .
A senior military officer at the g@@ ala , also attended by the Joint Chi@@ efs th@@ en-@@ chairman , Ad@@ m. Mike Mul@@ len , saw the troops &quot; role differently .
&quot; They were rolled out like some sort of orph@@ an k@@ id , &quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail .
I &apos;m sure the organiz@@ ers meant well .
I know they did .
But it wasn &apos;t respect , really . It was pity .
The stark@@ ly conflic@@ ting impres@@ sions illustr@@ ate the un@@ easy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes ad@@ oring American public .
The troops are lav@@ ished with praise for their sacri@@ fi@@ ces .
But the praise comes with a price , service members say .
The public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform .
&quot; We aren &apos;t victims at all , &quot; said Bri@@ g. Gen@@ . S@@ ean B. Mac@@ Far@@ land , who comm@@ anded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan .
&quot; But it seems that the only way that some can be suppor@@ tive is to cast us in the role of ha@@ pl@@ ess sou@@ ls . &quot;
The topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear ung@@ r@@ ateful or at od@@ ds with the public they serve .
They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War was far worse .
As a result , most of the convers@@ ations about pity take place quiet@@ ly and priv@@ ately among combat veter@@ ans .
After his two sons returned from combat tours with the Mar@@ ines , reti@@ red Col@@ . Mark Can@@ cian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives .
Some would look at them with a sense of a@@ we because they faced down insur@@ g@@ ents and travel@@ ed to exotic places .
Others would wonder whether there was an &quot; an@@ gr@@ y , violent veter@@ an bene@@ ath the surface , &quot; said Can@@ cian , who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government job in Washington .
During his job search , he said , he sen@@ sed that some inter@@ vie@@ wers had sub@@ tly in@@ qui@@ red whether he would be able to hold up under the stra@@ in of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour .
&quot; When you talk about your service , you need to counter the negative impres@@ sions , &quot; Can@@ cian rec@@ alled telling his sons .
The military &apos;s un@@ ease springs , in part , from American in@@ difference to the wars .
B@@ att@@ le@@ field achievements are rarely sing@@ led out for praise by a country that has little famili@@ arity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
&quot; We , as a nation , no longer value military hero@@ ism in ways that were entirely common in World War II , &quot; said reti@@ red Lt@@ . Gen@@ . David Bar@@ no , who comm@@ anded U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Instead , praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member &apos;s suffering .
Tro@@ ops are recognized for the number of tours they have endu@@ red , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their inj@@ uries .
Military Fac@@ es Moun@@ ting Press@@ ure to Cra@@ ck D@@ own on Rap@@ e
This week , a land@@ mark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged in@@ action on rap@@ e .
If not , hundreds of pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs are lining up for the next one .
Pf@@ c. Eli@@ za@@ beth Ly@@ man was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregn@@ ant the night she says she was rap@@ ed by a fellow soldi@@ er .
It was October 2008 , and she was heading back to her bar@@ ra@@ cks at Mira@@ mar Air Station , just north of San Die@@ go , after dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-@@ pack of beer .
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .
&quot; A red flag went up , &quot; Ly@@ man says .
But the Texas native br@@ us@@ hed aside her concern .
I thought , no , he &apos;s 19 .
&quot; He &apos;s from Texas , &quot; she says .
&quot; I wish I had listened to my inst@@ inc@@ ts . &quot;
Within minutes of entering Ly@@ man &apos;s room , the man came up from behind her , thro@@ wing her down and rap@@ ing her , she alleg@@ es .
This week , on Nov@@ . 18 , Ly@@ man and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxi@@ ously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in Ar@@ ling@@ ton , V@@ a . , that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secre@@ tary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald R@@ ums@@ feld , will go to trial .
The suit alleg@@ es that Gates and R@@ ums@@ feld failed to cur@@ tail widespread rap@@ e within the military , in violation of soldiers &quot; constitutional rights .
Fil@@ ed in February by Sus@@ an Bur@@ ke , a Washington , D.@@ C. , att@@ or@@ ney , the suit initially involved 17 pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men , all of whom alle@@ ge that they were rap@@ ed or sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate , prosec@@ ute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .
Bur@@ ke says she is going after the military &apos;s top bra@@ ss because the problem begins with them .
&quot; The military is a top-@@ down structure , &quot; she says .
&quot; Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradic@@ ate the culture of re@@ tali@@ ation ? The top leadership . &quot;
Bur@@ ke also says that since February , she has been cont@@ acted by nearly 400 other survi@@ vors , many of whom could be part of future suits .
Her strategy : rather than p@@ iling all the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one bas@@ ket , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .
The defense team for the Department of Def@@ ense , led by United States Att@@ or@@ ney N@@ eil Mac@@ Bri@@ de , has filed a motion to dis@@ miss the case .
The court papers , obtained by News@@ week , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be su@@ ed by current or former soldiers for inj@@ uries incurred in the armed forces .
Per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Fer@@ es Doc@@ tr@@ ine , the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by activ@@ e-@@ duty personnel .
&quot; The alleged har@@ ms are incident to pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs &quot; military service , &quot; the documents say .
The Department of Def@@ ense dec@@ lined to comment for this story .
Th@@ ings have changed since the &apos; 50@@ s .
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have clear front lines .
In both Iraq and Afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .
The result : between those two wars , 150 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during combat situations .
It &apos;s time for the military to moderni@@ ze as well , Bur@@ ke says .
She isn &apos;t alone in her fight ; three other law@@ suits are under way in addition to h@@ ers .
At Y@@ ale Law School , the Veter@@ ans &quot; Legal Services Clin@@ ic is preparing a case against the four major military ac@@ ade@@ mies for alle@@ ge@@ dly fo@@ stering a mis@@ o@@ gy@@ nis@@ tic atmosphere .
Se@@ par@@ ately , the non@@ profit Vietnam Veter@@ ans of America is assemb@@ ling a suit against the military that focuses on the &quot; personality dis@@ order &quot; diagno@@ ses assigned to rap@@ e victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occur@@ rence , according to activists such as An@@ u B@@ ha@@ g@@ wat@@ i of the Service Women &apos;s Action Network , a human@@ -@@ rights group .
Her group filed a suit in December against the Veter@@ ans Administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it hand@@ les benefit claims for people who say they were sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted in the service .
N@@ ine separate b@@ ills have been introduced in Congress by a bi@@ parti@@ san mix of sen@@ ators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .
In 2010 there were 3,@@ 15@@ 8 sexual ass@@ aults reported , according to the Department of Def@@ ense &apos;s Sex@@ ual Ass@@ ault Pre@@ vention and Respon@@ se Office .
But ass@@ aults are not@@ ori@@ ously under@@ reported , and by the Pent@@ ag@@ on &apos;s own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 13.@@ 5 percent of the estimated 19@@ ,000 incidents that occurred that year .
The report , released in March , also exam@@ ines prosec@@ ution rates : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .
The pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs in Bur@@ ke &apos;s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of trau@@ mas .
In Ly@@ man &apos;s case , she reported the alleged rap@@ e to military police less than an hour after it occurred .
That night , she says , she was asked to re@@ count the details of her rap@@ e 11 separate times to a stream of police , doctors , and comm@@ anders .
She did a rap@@ e kit , and her as@@ sail@@ ant &apos;s blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
Six months later , in April 2009 , Ly@@ man sat through a hearing before a judge , during which she was ques@@ tioned about having had sex with her boy@@ friend earlier on the day of the attack .
Six people t@@ esti@@ fied as character witn@@ esses on behalf of the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator , who was eventually acqu@@ it@@ ted .
&quot; I remember the day when the verdi@@ ct was read , &quot; Ly@@ man says .
&quot; I thought I was going to go into labor - I ran scre@@ aming from the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; They put me into the psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c unit , and when I got out , I remember saying to my command officer , &quot; That wasn &apos;t his trial . That was my trial . &quot; &quot;
Ly@@ man was ordered to visit a military psy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist , who eventually diagno@@ sed her with a personality dis@@ order , ren@@ dering her un@@ fit for service .
In January 2010 she was disch@@ ar@@ ged under less@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ hon@@ or@@ able terms , preventing her from receiving any benefits .
As for whether the case filed by Ly@@ man and her fellow pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs moves forward , it &apos;s a long shot , says John Tur@@ ley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School .
However , he notes , &quot; In my view they should be able to move forward . &quot;
What stands between them and a verdi@@ ct is this doctr@@ ine that has been critici@@ zed since it was first issued .
I &apos;ve been a lifelong cri@@ tic of the Fer@@ es Doc@@ tr@@ ine .
The military is decades behind because they don &apos;t have the same incentive and deter@@ rent posed by liability .
He adds , &quot; The od@@ ds are heavily against them ... but it &apos;s important for them to try . &quot;
These things only change when good people are willing to fight .
If the hearing doesn &apos;t go their way , Bur@@ ke , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs &quot; lawyer , will cu@@ e up her hundreds of other pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs for future cases .
&quot; We will continue batt@@ ling the military on this issue until reform occurs , &quot; she says .
Or until we die , wh@@ ich@@ ever comes first .
W@@ alls Have E@@ yes : How Res@@ ear@@ chers Are Stu@@ dying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-@@ wing extremis@@ m in Europe , Anders B@@ ehr@@ ing B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k was just another guy air@@ ing his anti-@@ immigration views online .
On Monday , B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , who admitted to a killing spre@@ e in Norway in July which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
While B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cy@@ ber@@ space : he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , chat@@ ting with some of the millions of nation@@ alists who support right-@@ wing groups on soci@@ al-@@ networking sites .
After this summer &apos;s tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
But how to find them ?
Easy - just log on to Facebook .
&quot; We realized that it wasn &apos;t that difficult to get to them at all , &quot; says Jam@@ ie Bar@@ t@@ le@@ tt , the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populi@@ sm by British think tank D@@ EM@@ OS .
Facebook &apos;s st@@ ash of personal information is so en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedi@@ c , says Bar@@ t@@ le@@ tt , that the researchers could simply use the site &apos;s advertising tool to pin@@ point their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way mark@@ eters have been doing for years .
Bar@@ t@@ le@@ tt &apos;s team found half a million fans of right-@@ wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads , but instead of linking to a new band or diet product , the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level , attitudes towards violence and optim@@ ism about their own future .
By reaching out through Facebook , Bar@@ t@@ le@@ tt and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 fol@@ lo@@ wers of 14 far-@@ right parties in 11 European countries - all without ever leaving the office .
&quot; It &apos;s quite a new way of doing research , &quot; Bar@@ t@@ le@@ tt says .
Some of the results aren &apos;t all that surprising : online supporters of right-@@ wing groups tend to be young , male , and v@@ ex@@ ed by immigration .
But in something of a tw@@ ist , &quot; those who combine their online activ@@ ism with offline activ@@ ism are more reasonable , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen . &quot;
D@@ EM@@ OS &apos;s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
Th@@ ink tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in &apos; Li@@ kes &apos; , wall posts and status updates .
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the Facebook &quot; data super@@ nov@@ a &quot; is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site &apos;s name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .
For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn &apos;t approach with a cli@@ p@@ board on the street .
&quot; Before , when you tried to survey people from the British National Party , it would be very difficult to identify them . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;d have to go through the party and they would never allow you access , &quot; says Bar@@ t@@ le@@ tt .
&quot; Facebook cuts all that out - you go to them directly . &quot;
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle soci@@ al-@@ health problems .
A recent study by Dr. Meg@@ an Mor@@ eno of the University of Wis@@ consi@@ n , Ma@@ dis@@ on and her colleagues found that under@@ gradu@@ ates who discussed their dr@@ un@@ ken explo@@ its on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .
Mor@@ eno suggests that students &apos; pe@@ ers , such as residential advis@@ ors , could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many boo@@ zy status updates .
&quot; You can &apos;t treat a problem if you can &apos;t diagno@@ se it , &quot; Dim@@ it@@ ri Christ@@ akis , Mor@@ eno &apos;s co-@@ author and director of the Center for Child Health , Beh@@ avi@@ or and Development at the Seattle Children &apos;s Research Institute , told the Washington Post .
&quot; We &apos;ve found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagno@@ sed . &quot;
Facebook , too , is constantly ta@@ pping into its own population for data .
The site &apos;s Data Team has worked up stat@@ s on relationship status and Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s Day , vot@@ er turn@@ out in the 2010 mid@@ terms , and a National Happ@@ iness Index ( mainly using information only it can access - champ@@ ions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast tro@@ ve of data available to others for research . )
But Facebook &apos;s users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
But what about when Facebook users become part of a survey they don &apos;t even know about ?
While researchers have well-@@ defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline , online it &apos;s a free-@@ for@@ -@@ all .
&quot; I don &apos;t think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a resear@@ cher could be looking at their profiles , &quot; says N@@ eil Sel@@ w@@ yn , a soci@@ ologist at the London Knowledge Lab , of a 2006 study he conducted using students &apos; public Facebook walls .
&quot; As far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . &quot;
Then there &apos;s the question of methodology .
Even offline , there &apos;s no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .
On Facebook , it &apos;s impossible to know how much of a user &apos;s profile information and wall posts are true .
&quot; What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things , &quot; says Sel@@ w@@ yn .
Which is why , despite his years as a technology resear@@ cher , Sel@@ w@@ yn thinks a cli@@ p@@ board and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .
&quot; There &apos;s no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , &quot; he says .
&quot; Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place offline . &quot;
&quot; Cold and In@@ human &quot; : Anders B@@ ehr@@ ing B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k Mak@@ es First Public Court Ap@@ pe@@ arance
Anders B@@ ehr@@ ing B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the man who conf@@ essed to master@@ min@@ ding twin attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer , has described himself as a &quot; resistance &quot; figh@@ ter during his first public court appearance in Oslo .
&quot; I am a military comm@@ ander in the Norwe@@ gian resistance movement and K@@ nights Tem@@ pl@@ ar Norway , &quot; he said before a cour@@ tro@@ om packed with 500 people .
&quot; I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support h@@ ate ideology and because it supports mul@@ ticul@@ tu@@ rali@@ sm . &quot;
&quot; I acknowledge the acts but I do not ple@@ ad guilty . &quot;
Ju@@ dge Tor@@ k@@ j@@ el N@@ es@@ heim interrupted B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k during that mon@@ olo@@ gue because he &quot; did not want to give B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views . &quot;
For the same reason he refused to allow B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , who brought a pre-@@ written speech with him , to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .
N@@ es@@ heim also ordered police to hold B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k in cu@@ sto@@ dy for 12 more weeks , banned him from accessing media for four weeks , and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspon@@ dence for eight weeks .
Around 30 survi@@ vors and victims &quot; relatives attended the hearing .
Some came hoping to look B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k in the eye , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key .
All attended with the goal of moving toward closure .
&quot; I thought he seemed cold and in@@ human , &quot; one U@@ to@@ ya survi@@ vor told Norwe@@ gian broad@@ cast@@ er N@@ R@@ K .
&quot; It was un@@ comfortable , but for me I moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . &quot;
Dres@@ sed in a dark suit and blue tie , B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survi@@ vors in the eye as he entered and ex@@ ited the building .
Despite B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k &apos;s bizarre notion of being part of a larger &quot; resistance &quot; movement , the judge determined that he is not ins@@ ane , and said that there is no evidence he acted with accompli@@ ces .
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extrem@@ ist rather than a group of ra@@ dic@@ als .
But that doesn &apos;t automatically ease the grie@@ f and confusion that an entire nation still feels .
&quot; I wish he looked like a mon@@ ster , but he doesn &apos;t , &quot; a relative of one victim said .
&quot; It would be so much easier if he did . &quot;
7 L@@ ess@@ ons From the Lo@@ st Steve Jobs Interview , Sho@@ wing at a Theater This We@@ ek
Following the death of Steve Jobs on Oc@@ t@@ . 5 , there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - sing@@ ling out the tech geni@@ us as the Great Modern Inv@@ ent@@ or .
But what Apple fans might find most reve@@ aling in a recently re@@ discovered Jobs interview du@@ sted off in advance of special movie screen@@ ings in major markets this week , is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product work@@ flows .
He was certainly a designer , dre@@ am@@ er and self-@@ identified hi@@ pp@@ ie , but he was also a me@@ tic@@ ulous organiz@@ er and f@@ low-@@ chart t@@ weaker - a man who believed that many business exec@@ u@@ tives suffered from &quot; a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... &#91; but &#93; there &apos;s a tremendous amount of cra@@ fts@@ manship between a great idea and a great product . &quot;
Back in 1995 , Bo@@ b C@@ ring@@ ely was developing the TV series Tri@@ umph of the Ner@@ ds about the da@@ wn of the personal computer , and he sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for a rare , extended conversation .
At that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company Ne@@ X@@ T , looking forward to the popular adoption of the Internet .
While a small portion of C@@ ring@@ ely &apos;s interview was used in Ner@@ ds , he says that the interview &apos;s master copies went missing in shipping .
It was only following Jobs &quot; death that a complete V@@ HS copy was discovered in the director &apos;s garage .
This foot@@ age , slightly re-@@ edited , is the basis of the 6@@ 8-@@ minute Steve Jobs : The Lo@@ st Interview , coming to Land@@ mark Theat@@ ers this Wednesday and Thursday .
For someone known to lo@@ a@@ the in-depth interviews , Jobs seems surpris@@ ingly e@@ ager here to ex@@ po@@ und on his technological philosophi@@ es and business strategies .
And incredibly thou@@ ghtful .
At four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15-@@ second ru@@ min@@ ations , where Jobs is clearly weigh@@ ing his thoughts , aiming for precision .
There are also moments where Jobs &quot; perfec@@ tion@@ ism rises to the surface , where he seems imp@@ ati@@ ent about C@@ ring@@ ely &apos;s questions , nu@@ dging him to move faster towards issues or sub@@ p@@ lots of greater import .
Fil@@ med before the era of Pi@@ x@@ ar , the iPod or the iPhone , there &apos;s something e@@ eri@@ ly pres@@ ci@@ ent about the Lo@@ st Interview , as Jobs ass@@ esses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of comp@@ uting .
It &apos;s one thing to read pos@@ thum@@ ous app@@ ra@@ is@@ als of Jobs &quot; career , but there &apos;s something raw and insp@@ iring about the Jobs we see here , the anxi@@ ous dre@@ am@@ er on the br@@ ink of great@@ ness .
He has a vision for the way things could be and should be .
Not long after sp@@ elling it all out here he went and did it .
A quick run@@ down of seven notable Lo@@ st Interview sequ@@ ences :
On how he learned to run a business :
&quot; Throughout the years in business , I &apos;d always ask : &quot; Why do you do things ? &quot; and the answers you inv@@ ari@@ ably get are : &quot; O@@ h , that &apos;s just the way it &apos;s done . &quot; &quot;
N@@ obo@@ dy knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in business .
That &apos;s what I found .
Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to stream@@ line accounting at Apple .
B@@ aff@@ led by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a &quot; standard cost &quot; that amoun@@ ted to a blind gu@@ ess , which was then adjusted with a &quot; vari@@ ance &quot; - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
On p@@ ranking the P@@ ope :
Jobs re@@ counts the &quot; Blue Box &quot; that he built with Steve Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak - a device that allowed people to effectively h@@ ack the phone company and make long distance calls for free .
The device has been widely written about before , but Jobs &quot; eu@@ ph@@ oria here in descri@@ bing the Blue Box as an act of em@@ power@@ ment is infec@@ tious .
He describes how he and Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one AT &amp; T network to another while lo@@ op@@ ing in as many satelli@@ tes as possible .
&quot; We were wra@@ pping things around the globe a half do@@ zen times and you would y@@ ell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , &quot; Jobs says with a gi@@ ggle .
&quot; We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . &quot;
Us two , we didn &apos;t know much , but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson , and I don &apos;t think there would have ever been Apple without it .
Jobs goes on to detail one gl@@ orious p@@ rank that he and Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak nearly pul@@ led of , ring@@ ing the Vati@@ can via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the P@@ ope , while doing their very best impression of Henry Kis@@ singer .
As various members of the Catholic hierarch@@ y were sum@@ mon@@ ed in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplom@@ at , the two bur@@ st into gi@@ gg@@ les just before the P@@ ope himself was ro@@ used to come answer the phone .
On falling in love with technology ( and col@@ d-@@ calling Bill He@@ wle@@ tt ) :
At the age of 12 , on the hun@@ t for spare parts to build a frequency counter , he looked up Bill He@@ wle@@ tt in the phone book and gave him a call .
Not long after their 20-@@ minute phone conversation , Jobs land@@ ed a part-@@ time summer job at He@@ wle@@ tt@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard .
&quot; That made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . &quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company &apos;s Pal@@ o Al@@ to research lab@@ s , where he saw &quot; the first desktop computer ever made . &quot;
It was as big as a su@@ it@@ case , had a small ca@@ tho@@ de ray tube display , and I fell in love with it .
I would get a ride up to HP as a teen@@ ager and hang around that machine and write programs for it .
On impro@@ vising innovation :
At several points in the interview , Jobs talks about inv@@ enting new products on the fly .
Early in his career , as he set out to sell a hand@@ ful of circuit boards , he was asked by a customer to ass@@ emble the full computer .
Working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
Later while at Apple , he rec@@ alls the stru@@ gg@@ les he faced in developing a computer mouse :
&quot; I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were scre@@ aming at me that it would take five years &#91; to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 &#93; , and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer . &quot;
N@@ in@@ ety days later , we had a mouse we could build for $ 15 that was incredibly reliable .
On great companies losing steam :
Long before he led the revi@@ val of Apple , Jobs pres@@ ci@@ ently fore@@ saw the ways in which so many industry leaders would st@@ um@@ ble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .
&quot; Sa@@ y you work at IBM or X@@ ero@@ x , so you make a better cop@@ ier or printer , so what ? &quot;
You have a monopoly of the market share , so the company &apos;s not more successful .
Sales and marketing makes it more successful , so &#91; it &apos;s those kinds of people &#93; who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision-making forum .
The product geni@@ us that led to that monopoli@@ stic position is rot@@ ted out by people who have no conception of good products v@@ s. bad products - the cra@@ fts@@ manship required .
That &apos;s what happened at X@@ ero@@ x ...
X@@ ero@@ x could have owned the entire computer industry .
It could have been ten times its size , could have been the Microsoft of the 9@@ 0s ...
They gra@@ b@@ bed defeat from victory .
On innovation as art form :
&quot; There &apos;s a tremendous amount of cra@@ fts@@ manship between a great idea and a great product ... as you evol@@ ve that great idea , it changes and grows . &quot;
You learn a lot about the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of it .
There are trade@@ off@@ s you have to make - certain things you can &apos;t make elec@@ tr@@ ons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...
Ul@@ tim@@ ately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to ex@@ pose yourself to the best stuff humans have done , and then trying to bring those things in to what you &apos;re doing .
Pic@@ asso said that good artists copy , great artists ste@@ al .
We &apos;ve always been sh@@ am@@ eless about ste@@ aling great ideas .
It &apos;s part of what made the Mac@@ in@@ to@@ sh great , was that the people who were working on it were musicians , po@@ ets , artists , zo@@ ologists , hist@@ ori@@ ans who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
If not for computer science , they would be doing amazing things in other fields .
Sc@@ alia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challeng@@ ers as court takes case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divi@@ sive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama &apos;s healthcare law , two of its jus@@ tic@@ es , Ant@@ on@@ in Sc@@ alia and Clar@@ ence Thomas , were f@@ eted at a dinner spon@@ sored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .
The occasion was last Thursday , when all nine jus@@ tic@@ es met for a conference to pour over the peti@@ tions for review .
One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the swe@@ eping healthcare over@@ hau@@ l passed by Congress last year , a law that has been a r@@ all@@ ying c@@ ry for conservative activists nation@@ wide .
The jus@@ tic@@ es agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a land@@ mark 5 1 / 2-@@ hour argument is expected in March , and the outcome is likely to further ro@@ il the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full s@@ wing by the time the court &apos;s decision is released .
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul C@@ lement , who served as U.S. so@@ lic@@ it@@ or general during the George W. Bush administration .
C@@ lement &apos;s law firm , Ban@@ cro@@ ft PL@@ L@@ C , was one of almost two do@@ zen firms that helped spon@@ sor the annual dinner of the Feder@@ alist Society , a long@@ standing group dedicated to advoc@@ ating conservative legal principles .
Another firm that spon@@ sored the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the trade associations that challeng@@ ed the law , the National Federation of Independent Business .
Another spon@@ sor was pharmaceutical giant P@@ fi@@ zer Inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the li@@ tig@@ ation .
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court &apos;s conference over the case .
In atten@@ dance was , among others , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell , the Sen@@ ate &apos;s top Republi@@ can and an avo@@ wed oppon@@ ent of the healthcare law .
The featured guests at the dinner ? Sc@@ alia and Thomas .
It &apos;s nothing new : The two jus@@ tic@@ es have been attending Feder@@ alist Society events for years .
And it &apos;s nothing that runs af@@ oul of ethics rules .
In fact , jus@@ tic@@ es are exemp@@ t from the Code of Con@@ duc@@ t that govern@@ s the actions of lower federal jus@@ tic@@ es .
If they were , they argu@@ ably fell under code &apos;s Canon 4@@ C , which states , &quot; A judge may attend fund@@ -@@ raising events of la@@ w-@@ related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . &quot;
Nevertheless , the she@@ er proximity of Sc@@ alia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm eth@@ ic@@ s-@@ in-@@ government activists .
&quot; This stunning breach of ethics and in@@ difference to the code be@@ lies claims by several jus@@ tic@@ es that the court ab@@ i@@ des by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , &quot; said Bo@@ b Ed@@ gar , the president of Common C@@ ause .
&quot; The jus@@ tic@@ es were win@@ ing and dining at a black@@ -@@ tie fund@@ ra@@ iser with att@@ or@@ neys who have pending cases before the court . &quot;
Their appearance and assistance in fund@@ raising for this event under@@ cuts any claims of im@@ parti@@ ality , and is unacceptable .
Sc@@ alia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agen@@ da-@@ driven groups such as the Feder@@ alist Society .
And Thomas &quot; wife , G@@ inn@@ i , is a high-@@ profile conservative activ@@ ist .
Moreover , con@@ servatives argue that it &apos;s Justice E@@ len@@ a K@@ agan who has an ethical issue , not Sc@@ alia and Thomas .
K@@ agan served as so@@ lic@@ it@@ or general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
Her critics have pushed for K@@ agan to rec@@ use herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be im@@ partial now .
K@@ agan has given no indication she will do so .
Bo@@ eing gets record $ 18-@@ billion jet@@ liner order
Em@@ ir@@ ates airline orders 50 tw@@ in-@@ a@@ is@@ le Bo@@ eing 7@@ 77 jet@@ lin@@ ers with an option for 20 more .
Bo@@ eing also s@@ ells six Bo@@ eing Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers to O@@ man Air , a deal worth more than $ 1 billion .
It &apos;s rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product .
But it &apos;s a big deal when the company is air@@ plan@@ e-@@ maker Bo@@ eing Co. and the list price for those 50 air@@ planes tot@@ als a record $ 18 billion .
Just as big is where Bo@@ eing got the order : the Middle East , a growing gold mine of future air@@ plane orders .
In a forecast released Monday , the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years will need 2,@@ 5@@ 20 air@@ planes worth $ 450 billion .
Bo@@ eing over the weekend announced its big@@ ge@@ st-@@ ever order by dollar value for commercial air@@ planes - 50 tw@@ in-@@ a@@ is@@ le Bo@@ eing 7@@ 77 j@@ ets .
The block@@ bu@@ ster order came from Em@@ ir@@ ates airline in Dubai .
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , which would push the total list price to $ 26 billion , Bo@@ eing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show .
Then on Monday , Bo@@ eing said O@@ man Air ordered six Bo@@ eing 7@@ 8@@ 7-@@ 8@@ s , the so-called Dre@@ am@@ liner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities .
List price for six of those is more than $ 1 billion .
&quot; This is clearly a huge positive for Bo@@ eing , &quot; Mor@@ n@@ ing@@ star analy@@ st Ne@@ al Di@@ hor@@ a said .
&quot; The quality of these particular customers is pretty strong . &quot;
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their o@@ il-@@ producing nations .
So , not only do they have the money to pay for planes , but a sur@@ ge in fuel prices - usually damaging to airlines because it &apos;s one of their biggest costs - is not as detri@@ mental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil .
That &apos;s important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay air@@ plane orders when fuel prices rise , Di@@ hor@@ a said .
&quot; They have a natural he@@ dge , &quot; he said .
The Em@@ ir@@ ates order solidi@@ fies Bo@@ eing &apos;s lead in the market for wide-@@ body planes and helps hold at bay competi@@ tor Airbus SA@@ S &apos; attempt to en@@ cro@@ ach on its domin@@ ance with the A3@@ 50 air@@ liner .
Bo@@ eing &apos;s win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would push back the de@@ but of the largest A3@@ 50 , which compet@@ es directly with the 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 300@@ ER .
It delayed the de@@ but to add more thr@@ ust after customers demanded more pay@@ load and range .
Bo@@ eing Co shares rose 1.5 % to $ 6@@ 7.@@ 94 .
Mexico president &apos;s sister apparently defe@@ ated in Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an vote
Lu@@ is@@ a Maria Cal@@ der@@ on alleg@@ es that drug traffi@@ ckers helped oppon@@ ent Fau@@ sto V@@ alle@@ jo of the PR@@ I in the govern@@ or &apos;s race .
President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on &apos;s sister appears to have lost her bid for govern@@ or of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an during violent state elections , and she alleged Monday that drug traffi@@ ckers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents .
Pre@@ liminary results gave the lead in the race for govern@@ or of the western state to Fau@@ sto V@@ alle@@ jo of the Institu@@ tional Revolu@@ tionary Party , or PR@@ I .
&quot; The intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an but for the entire country , &quot; Lu@@ is@@ a Maria Cal@@ der@@ on said in a radio interview a day after Sunday &apos;s vote .
&quot; They threatened our candidates , our pol@@ l workers .... They sei@@ zed bal@@ lot boxes , set up road@@ blocks ... and ordered people to vote &quot; for the PR@@ I .
The PR@@ I ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000 .
But it is st@@ aging a com@@ eb@@ ack , and victory in Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an is an important step in that effort .
The PR@@ I is hoping to win the presidential election in July .
V@@ alle@@ jo appears to have only narro@@ w@@ ly ed@@ ged out Cal@@ der@@ on , who had led p@@ olls before election day .
Cal@@ der@@ on , a candidate for her brother &apos;s conservative National Action Party , or P@@ AN , refused to recognize V@@ alle@@ jo as the winner .
Sil@@ v@@ ano Au@@ re@@ ol@@ es , the candidate for the le@@ f@@ ti@@ st Democratic Revolution Party , or PR@@ D , which currently holds the govern@@ or@@ ship , came in third , a bad defeat for the divided and ha@@ pl@@ ess left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote .
Au@@ re@@ ol@@ es also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
V@@ alle@@ jo , former may@@ or of the state capital of Mo@@ reli@@ a , denied ties to drug traffi@@ ckers and urged the other candidates to accept the results .
Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an has long been dominated by drug car@@ tels speciali@@ zing in mari@@ ju@@ ana , hero@@ in and me@@ th@@ amp@@ h@@ et@@ am@@ ines .
It is President Cal@@ der@@ on &apos;s home state , and he chose Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an to launch a milit@@ ar@@ y-@@ led offensive against traffi@@ ckers in December 2006 .
Yet violence has persi@@ sted .
A P@@ AN may@@ or was assass@@ inated a week before the election as he campaign@@ ed for Lu@@ is@@ a Maria Cal@@ der@@ on , and numerous candidates qu@@ it local races out of fear .
For the PR@@ I , though , however n@@ asty the Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an election looks , a win will help the party &apos;s momentum .
The man expected to represent the PR@@ I in the presidential race , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to , speaking from Washington , congratul@@ ated V@@ alle@@ jo and said , &quot; I think this victory should be very encouraging , looking ahead to next year . &quot;
AD@@ B ur@@ ges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called for India and China to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term down@@ turn that will stun@@ t the growth of Asian economies .
Ra@@ j@@ at N@@ ag , the managing director of the Man@@ il@@ a-@@ based AD@@ B , said the world &apos;s two fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing large economies had to &quot; do all they can &quot; to speed the recovery of the the currency blo@@ c either through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
He warned against Bri@@ c &#91; Brazil , Russia , India , China &#93; countries looking at Europe &apos;s difficulties in a &quot; disp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate way &quot; and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term break@@ down in the global economy .
&quot; We are all in this together . &quot;
&quot; So anybody who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful , &quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sid@@ el@@ ines of the World Economic Forum in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
&quot; Asia may be shi@@ el@@ ded to some extent but it cannot be immune . &quot;
&quot; So if China and India can help , by all means . &quot;
Europe &apos;s monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
In recent days , Italy &apos;s borro@@ wing costs have so@@ ared danger@@ ously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have re@@ signed .
The un@@ fol@@ ding sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and promp@@ ted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution .
Mr N@@ ag predic@@ ted that any Asian support would be chann@@ elled through the IMF , but said bilateral assistance -- like buying the bonds of the EU &apos;s ba@@ il-@@ out fund , the European financial stability facility -- offered greater bar@@ gaining power to Europe &apos;s Asian partners .
An@@ and Shar@@ ma , India &apos;s minister of trade , said that &quot; India will do whatever it can &quot; to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and a dr@@ ying up of foreign capital in@@ flows .
&quot; N@@ obo@@ dy wants the eurozone to remain unstable and tur@@ bul@@ ent , &quot; he said .
&quot; We have monum@@ ental challenges and we have to sustain a high level of growth . &quot;
&quot; It is not an option , it is an imperative , because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . &quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India have no business helping weal@@ thy Europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges .
Ash@@ ut@@ o@@ sh Var@@ sh@@ ney , a professor at Brown University in the US , said it would be politically very difficult to sell assistance to Europe to India &apos;s 1.@@ 2@@ bn people , of whom as many as 800@@ m live on about $ 2 a day or less .
&quot; Some@@ time they will find out that Gre@@ eks reti@@ re at the age of 50 and go on holiday to beaches and it won &apos;t go down well , &quot; he said .
Lee Ho@@ well , the managing director of the World Economic Forum , likewise ques@@ tioned why India &apos;s reserves should be used to keep Greece &apos;s numerous and well-@@ paid public sector workers in jobs in poor@@ ly managed , lo@@ ss-@@ making utili@@ ties like the railways .
Mr N@@ ag said that the eurozone crisis threatened &quot; significant kno@@ ck-@@ on effects &quot; across Asia .
The AD@@ B &apos;s forecast of 7.@@ 5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 now faced &quot; risks on the down@@ side &quot; because of the threat from Europe .
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot; contin@@ gency plans &quot; to protect themselves from a down@@ turn and significant capital out@@ flows from their economies .
D@@ ire war@@ nings from Pent@@ ag@@ on over potential defense cuts
Def@@ ense Secretary Le@@ on Pan@@ etta turned up the heat on Congress Monday , warning that lo@@ oming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hall@@ ways of the Pent@@ ag@@ on , to the batt@@ le@@ fields of Afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .
The Pent@@ ag@@ on already is di@@ ge@@ sting $ 450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $ 600 billion or more in cuts may be im@@ min@@ ent if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending .
&quot; The imp@@ acts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , &quot; Pan@@ etta said in a letter to Sens@@ . John Mc@@ C@@ ain , R-@@ Ari@@ zona , and Lin@@ d@@ sey Gra@@ ham , R@@ -S@@ outh Carol@@ ina .
He said that con@@ gres@@ sional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequ@@ est@@ ration would trigger 23 % acro@@ ss-@@ the-@@ board reductions and a halt to many new projects .
&quot; Such a large cut , applied in this in@@ discrimin@@ ate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects un@@ exec@@ utable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other moderni@@ zation efforts , &quot; Pan@@ etta wrote to the sen@@ ators .
&quot; We would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel invol@@ un@@ t@@ arily and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to fur@@ l@@ ough civilians in order to meet the target . &quot;
&quot; These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage read@@ iness . &quot;
The cuts would eventually hit combat troops , Pan@@ etta said .
&quot; While war@@ time funding in the Over@@ seas Contin@@ gency Oper@@ ations accounts is not directly affected by the sequ@@ ester , war efforts would be adver@@ sely affected by the severe dis@@ ruption in the base budgets , &quot; Pan@@ etta warned .
&quot; Con@@ trac@@ ting personnel would be cut , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract over@@ sight that support the war . &quot;
&quot; Pay@@ roll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to war@@ time vend@@ ors , and legal and policy support would be dis@@ rupted . &quot;
The two sen@@ ators had written Pan@@ etta 10 days ago , asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Def@@ ense Department .
&quot; The consequence of a sequ@@ ester on the Def@@ ense Department would set off a swift decline of the United States as the world &apos;s leading military power . &quot;
&quot; We are staun@@ ch@@ ly opposed to this dra@@ con@@ ian action , &quot; the sen@@ ators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Pan@@ etta &apos;s letter .
&quot; This is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . &quot;
&quot; The sequ@@ ester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States , and it should not be allowed to occur . &quot;
Whether the Pan@@ etta letter and the fresh war@@ nings from Sen@@ ators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exemp@@ t the Pent@@ ag@@ on from cuts remains to be seen .
Pan@@ etta has been increasingly outs@@ po@@ ken about the possible cuts , although he came to the top Pent@@ ag@@ on job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices .
At a news conference last week , the secre@@ tary of defense painted a ble@@ ak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core .
&quot; It &apos;s a ship without sail@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a bri@@ ga@@ de without bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s an air wing without enough trained pi@@ lots . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a paper tiger , an Army of bar@@ ra@@ cks , buildings and bom@@ bs without enough trained soldiers able to ac@@ comp@@ lish the mission , &quot; Pan@@ etta said in his opening remarks at the Pent@@ ag@@ on .
&quot; It &apos;s a force that suff@@ ers low mor@@ ale , poor read@@ iness and is unable to keep up with potential ad@@ vers@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; In effect , it invites ag@@ gression .. &quot;
In an ad@@ den@@ dum to his letters to Mc@@ C@@ ain and Gra@@ ham , Pan@@ etta sp@@ elled out new specific@@ s of how reductions &quot; generate significant operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . &quot;
And Pan@@ etta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .
That list included the F@@ 35 Joint Stri@@ ke Fi@@ ghter , a planned new bom@@ ber , the ne@@ x@@ t-@@ generation bal@@ li@@ stic sub@@ marine , the new litt@@ oral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Mar@@ ines need to replace the hum@@ ve@@ e .
Hal@@ ting further development and testing the F@@ 35 could generate some $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from China and other ri@@ vals .
How to spot a lie
A gl@@ ance at recent head@@ lines indicates just how serious and per@@ va@@ sive dec@@ eit and lying are in daily life .
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Herman C@@ ain is busy trading alleg@@ ations of sexual har@@ ass@@ ment with several women ; each side acc@@ uses the other of lying .
Administr@@ ators at P@@ enn State have been charged with per@@ jury for alle@@ ge@@ dly covering up reports that a reti@@ red football coach was sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ting boys .
Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open mic@@ roph@@ one asser@@ ting to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is a li@@ ar .
L@@ ying has destroyed care@@ ers and conv@@ ul@@ sed countries .
New York con@@ gress@@ man and Internet f@@ las@@ her Anth@@ ony W@@ einer made a f@@ ool of himself issuing den@@ i@@ als quickly contradi@@ cted by in@@ contro@@ verti@@ ble evidence .
For@@ mer presidential candidate John Ed@@ wards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover@@ -up of an extra@@ mar@@ ital affair .
And then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the media cir@@ cus President Bill Clinton un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Mon@@ ica Le@@ win@@ sky .
T@@ ales of che@@ ating on school and college tests are ri@@ fe .
There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .
Ment@@ ors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and che@@ ating are acceptable .
How much dec@@ eit do we encounter ?
On a given day , studies show , you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
Now granted , many of those are white lies .
Another study showed that stran@@ gers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
Dete@@ cting lies , or &quot; lie spot@@ ting , &quot; is an essential skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .
Far from being a parl@@ or game similar to , say , char@@ ades , where the object is to exc@@ la@@ im , &quot; Got@@ cha , &quot; dec@@ eption detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in-depth research projects , especially in psych@@ ology and physi@@ ology .
One result of the research is that most old my@@ ths about lying have been deb@@ un@@ ked .
Li@@ ars do look you in the eye .
They do not always st@@ utter , stam@@ mer , b@@ lush or fi@@ d@@ get .
Don &apos;t conclude from this that li@@ ars are hard to spot and difficult to un@@ mask .
A trained lie spo@@ tter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure , fac@@ ial micro-@@ expressions , question formation and timing .
I spent several years surve@@ ying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on dec@@ eption , and it is clear that dec@@ eption detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navig@@ ating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hi@@ ring , inter@@ viewing , negotiating or managing .
Good li@@ ars are skilled at reading others well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intu@@ iti@@ vely sen@@ sing how others perc@@ eive them .
We know from research that ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts lie more than intro@@ ver@@ ts , that men tell more &quot; self-@@ oriented &quot; lies while women tell more &quot; o@@ ther@@ -@@ oriented &quot; lies -- usually to protect someone &apos;s feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than un@@ married people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be &quot; wh@@ op@@ pers &quot; ) .
We also know that if you are perceived as a wron@@ g@@ do@@ er , others will feel less gu@@ ilt in lying to you .
How do you tell if someone is lying ?
First , observe your subject &apos;s normal behavior .
This is called &quot; bas@@ el@@ ining . &quot;
It helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later .
Ob@@ serve your subject &apos;s post@@ ure , lau@@ gh , vocal quality .
You &apos;d better know if someone normally ta@@ ps their foot all the time so you don &apos;t make un@@ just accus@@ ations when you see foot@@ -@@ ta@@ pping in the middle of the meeting .
Then look for clu@@ sters of dec@@ ep@@ tive verb@@ al and non@@ verb@@ al behavi@@ ors .
Consi@@ der these clu@@ sters red flags , not proof of dec@@ eption .
Dec@@ ep@@ tive people might free@@ ze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their post@@ ure in significant ways or exhi@@ bit &quot; post-@@ interview relief &quot; -- that exagger@@ ated ex@@ hal@@ e of relief and shift in post@@ ure when all the hard questions are over .
Inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ators often fal@@ sely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post-@@ interview relief .
Also , pay attention to your subject &apos;s language .
Scott Pe@@ ter@@ son fam@@ ously sli@@ pped and used the past ten@@ se while claiming his murdered wife was alive , launching a nation@@ wide search for her .
Dec@@ ep@@ tive individuals might also use distan@@ cing language : &quot; I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Mis@@ s Le@@ win@@ sky &quot; or repeat a hard question in its enti@@ rety .
The most common verb@@ al indicators are sub@@ tle .
Some@@ one might use lots of &quot; quali@@ fying language &quot; when answer@@ ing a hard question : &quot; Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge . &quot;
This ren@@ ders the answer perc@@ ep@@ tual rather than fac@@ tual and is often a red flag .
There &apos;s no magic bul@@ let for dete@@ cting lies , but developing skills to fer@@ ret out dec@@ eption is possible .
These skills will enhance anyone &apos;s chances of avoiding vic@@ tim@@ ization by sc@@ am artists in their professional and personal lives .
Contro@@ versi@@ al Oil Pi@@ peline Plan to Be R@@ er@@ ou@@ ted After Th@@ re@@ at of Del@@ a@@ yed U.S. Appro@@ val
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- an@@ gering unions while appe@@ asing environment@@ alists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it &apos;s willing to r@@ er@@ ou@@ te the project to get it back on track .
Trans@@ Canada said Monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sand@@ hills area of Neb@@ ra@@ ska , and is confident the project will still win approval .
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Neb@@ ra@@ ska Cap@@ it@@ ol .
Trans@@ Canada official Ale@@ x P@@ our@@ ba@@ x says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .
That comes after the State Department &apos;s announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sand@@ hills areas of Neb@@ ra@@ ska and the O@@ gall@@ ala a@@ qui@@ fer , a vast underground water supply .
&quot; This is a real path forward , &quot; Rep@@ . Lee Ter@@ ry , a Republi@@ can from Neb@@ ra@@ ska , told Fox News .
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department likely would push off any decision until 2013 , after next year &apos;s elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision .
Obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the State Department &apos;s call , and expressed support for it .
The 1,@@ 7@@ 00-@@ mile pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico .
It would carry 7@@ 00@@ ,000 bar@@ rel@@ s per day from the province of Alber@@ ta to refin@@ eries in Texas .
To do so would require it crossing six states .
It is h@@ ated by environment@@ alists but loved by labor groups , who have ban@@ ked on the estimated 20@@ ,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
But Neb@@ ra@@ ska law@@ makers opposed to the plan are weigh@@ ing legislation to force a move away from the Sand H@@ ills region and O@@ gall@@ ala a@@ qui@@ fer , a major source of drinking water and ir@@ ri@@ gation .
The State Department &apos;s current Environmental Imp@@ act Stu@@ dy found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental imp@@ acts , but the energy industry source said the department &apos;s inspec@@ tor general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , c@@ entering on two questions .
One is whether a lob@@ by@@ ist hi@@ red by Trans@@ Canada , Paul El@@ li@@ ott , who was a campaign adv@@ iser to H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton in 2008 , represents a conflict of interest for the program .
The other is whether a firm that was hi@@ red to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to Trans@@ Canada .
P@@ att@@ i La@@ B@@ elle Su@@ ed for Alle@@ ge@@ dly C@@ aus@@ ing To@@ dd@@ ler to V@@ om@@ it out of Fe@@ ar
A New York family claims that disc@@ o di@@ va P@@ att@@ i La@@ B@@ elle launched into a ra@@ mp@@ age in the lobby of their Manhattan building , terri@@ fying their to@@ dd@@ ler daughter to the point where she thre@@ w up in fear .
The &quot; Lady Mar@@ mal@@ ade &quot; singer &apos;s ti@@ ra@@ de fri@@ gh@@ tened 18-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old Gene@@ vie@@ ve Mon@@ k so badly that she suffered &quot; personality changes , sleep dis@@ order &quot; and &quot; increased fear of stran@@ gers , &quot; her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court suit .
It was Nov@@ . 10 of last year when sta@@ geh@@ and Kev@@ in Mon@@ k , his kinder@@ gar@@ ten-@@ teacher wife , Ro@@ se@@ anna , and Gene@@ vie@@ ve were getting ready to go on a family trip .
While Kev@@ in Mon@@ k got the car , Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k came down to the lobby of their Ri@@ ver@@ side Bou@@ levard building with their luggage , carrying Gene@@ vie@@ ve .
Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment .
&quot; Some@@ one came up behind me and said , &quot; Do you know what your daughter is doing ? &quot; I said &quot; yes &quot; and went to pick her up , &quot; she said .
La@@ B@@ elle an@@ gri@@ ly ad@@ mon@@ ished the pregn@@ ant woman .
&quot; She said in an aggressive tone , &quot; You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have left your daughter by the door , &quot; &quot; Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k said .
&quot; I told her , &quot; I have no interest in what you say or think . &apos; &quot;
She became en@@ ra@@ ged and started using prof@@ an@@ ities -- the C-@@ word and the F-@@ word in a loud voice ...
She had a bottle of water and started fli@@ cking water from the bottle on me .
She said Gene@@ vie@@ ve got h@@ yst@@ er@@ ical .
&quot; I said to this woman , &quot; Look what you &apos;ve done to my daughter , &quot; &quot; the child &apos;s mother said .
La@@ B@@ elle lung@@ ed at the mo@@ m -- who was still holding Gene@@ vie@@ ve -- and had to be restra@@ ined by her ent@@ ou@@ rage and pul@@ led out to a waiting car , Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k said .
The tot was cr@@ ying so hard that she v@@ om@@ ited , she added .
Later , the family sent a note asking for an ap@@ ology from La@@ B@@ elle but got no response .
La@@ B@@ elle &apos;s lawyer and representatives did not return calls for comment .
The suit seeks un@@ specified damages , but the family &apos;s lawyer , S@@ am Dav@@ is , said he took the case for free and that the family plans to don@@ ate any money it gets to a children &apos;s cancer char@@ ity .
&quot; The purpose is to hold P@@ att@@ i La@@ B@@ elle responsible for her conduct , &quot; Dav@@ is said .
&quot; That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable , especially when aimed at a kinder@@ garten teacher carrying an 18-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old child . &quot;
The clim@@ atic ad@@ versity s@@ lowed down the economy
During the first year of Mario L@@ op@@ ez Val@@ dez management , in Sin@@ alo@@ a increased the unemployment and the in@@ formali@@ ty , foreign investment dec@@ lined and the economy was reduced .
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sin@@ alo@@ a , being related to the first year of Mario L@@ op@@ ez Val@@ dez government also called the year of change , which generated great expectations as regards the development of the economy , but given the clim@@ atic ad@@ versity of the beginning of the year , there was no growth , however there was registered a decline in the main indicators of economic development .
The low February temperatures , not only did they cause losses of millions for the agricultural sector , but they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow , causing a contra@@ ction of the economic activity in general of 3.@@ 6 percent in the first half of the year , mainly supported by the historic fall of 3@@ 1.@@ 16 per cent in agriculture , which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors .
According to the report regarding the areas affected by the fro@@ st , issued by the Mexican Council for Sustain@@ able Rural Development there were damaged 8@@ 3@@ 5.@@ 5@@ 82 hectares , out of which 7@@ 8.@@ 03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining of 21.@@ 07 percent had partial damage . The main damaged crops were the vegetables , cor@@ n and chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a .
The fall in the economic activity has generated , until November , a constant increase of the unemployment in the state , according to the National Institute of Statisti@@ cs and Ge@@ ography , the unemployment state rate during the first three quarters of the year registered an acceler@@ ated growth , from January to March 5@@ 5.@@ 0@@ 53 Sin@@ alo@@ a habit@@ ants were unemployed , with a rate of 4.@@ 53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter , the rate became 5.@@ 28 percent , and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.@@ 19 percent , a rate that in terms of the number of people represents more than 7@@ 4.@@ 000 of unemployed Sin@@ alo@@ a habit@@ ants , an increase compared to the first half of 18.@@ 9@@ 69 individuals .
Lower liquidity
Un@@ employment in Sin@@ alo@@ a during the year is multi-@@ fac@@ torial , for the econom@@ ist Ger@@ ardo L@@ op@@ ez Cer@@ v@@ antes , director at the Fac@@ ul@@ ty of Econom@@ ics and Social Sciences of the U@@ AS , the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly , depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken .
&quot; What we &apos;re seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors , including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constra@@ int imposed by the legislation that passed in the Congress in order to combat money la@@ undering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with , invest and use them in something &quot; he said .
St@@ opp@@ ed Imm@@ igration
L@@ op@@ ez Cer@@ v@@ antes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor .
&quot; The number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad , in the United States has been restricted , first of all due to the difficulties to enter , and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job , that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here , in the state , causing the rate of unemployment to rise , &quot; he said .
In@@ formali@@ ty
The labor market analysis of Sin@@ alo@@ a gets worse when considering the high level of in@@ formali@@ ty that prev@@ ails among the working conditions , according to IN@@ EG@@ I , 6@@ 0.@@ 38 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution .
In addition to the unemployment and in@@ formali@@ ty , another state labor remin@@ der is represented by low wages ; the entity has the lowest wages in the country , according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel@@ fare .
The monthly average income of Sin@@ alo@@ a workers was , until September , 5.@@ 3@@ 52 p@@ es@@ os , well below the national average , that is of 7.@@ 3@@ 75 p@@ es@@ os .
Con@@ tra@@ ction of F@@ DI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and high unemployment rate , in 2011 there was recorded the largest decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years , according to the Ministry of Finance from January to June the state F@@ DI tot@@ aled 6@@ 3@@ 0.@@ 6@@ 97 dollars , which represents a fall of 8@@ 7.@@ 74 percent compared to the 5.@@ 14@@ 3.@@ 3@@ 12 dollars during the same period of last year .
For its part , the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accoun@@ ted a total investment of 17.@@ 28@@ 0.000 p@@ es@@ os during the year , which occurred mainly in ter@@ ti@@ ary sector companies .
Deb@@ t
Against the backdrop of economic down@@ turn , the state government asked in July during the state congress , the approval of a credit of 3 billion p@@ es@@ os , which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municip@@ alities , in order to re@@ activate the economy , the local con@@ gres@@ sional approval was for a total of 2.@@ 600 million p@@ es@@ os , and until November no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy .
Re@@ actions
For business representatives , the first year of Mario L@@ op@@ ez Val@@ des government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government .
Miguel Lo@@ re@@ do L@@ op@@ ez , president of the National Chamber of Trans@@ formation Industry , said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmon@@ ization of the will@@ s of various sectors , including the state government itself .
&quot; The performance of the economy in Sin@@ alo@@ a this year has been really poor , one has to work hard in order to reg@@ ain the ground lost this year , in 2012 we must re@@ double our efforts , we failed to ali@@ gn the efforts of all and above all the good and synchron@@ ized motion of the new government team , we hope that next year will be much better &quot; he said .
Economic slow@@ ness
L@@ op@@ ez Lo@@ re@@ do said that the events such as early fro@@ st this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
&quot; The low economic flow is the product of several events , including fro@@ st , one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not turn fast enough for generating an economic dynam@@ ism that allows having an acceptable flow level of the processes , products and services and therefore , at the end of the year we are closing it below our expectations , &quot; he said .
Re@@ defining the vocation
Te@@ od@@ oro Sal@@ az@@ ar U@@ ri@@ arte , president of the Emplo@@ yers &quot; Con@@ federation of the Mexican Republic in Sin@@ alo@@ a , said that the state is required to prosec@@ ute the most dynamic productive activities .
&quot; Overall , we found that there has been working on , we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that re@@ defines the vocation and the economic course of the state , it is important to de@@ ton@@ ate all the material and human potential resource that Sin@@ alo@@ a has , &quot; he said .
Work to Do
Cop@@ ar@@ me@@ x President stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government .
&quot; Overall I would say that the Government has been stri@@ ving to be successful in various fields , in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term program , &quot; he said .
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy .
&quot; There are elements that allow us saying that the government is becoming more inclusive , and what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to do , &quot; he said .
They condemn him for 8 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of mari@@ ju@@ ana
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was the sentence given to a Na@@ vol@@ ato citizen for the possession of eight ki@@ los of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
The General Att@@ or@@ ney Office reported that the sent@@ enced drug dealer is O@@ mar Ale@@ xis Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela Sand@@ o@@ val , for the crime against health , in its vari@@ ant of possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana for purposes of trade .
According to the record AP / S@@ IN / CL@@ N / 6@@ 87 / 2010 / M@@ I , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela Sand@@ o@@ val was arrested by the Mexican Army , the 7th of June 2010 , in a surveillance operation on the street Ci@@ pri@@ ano Val@@ dez , in front of the post 80 in the town of El Cas@@ ti@@ llo , Na@@ vol@@ ato .
The drug dealer was driving a white pi@@ ck@@ up truck , where he was carrying a black bag in the box of the vehicle and on the passenger &apos;s seat a small back@@ pack , where the soldiers found eight ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s and 23 gram@@ s of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
For these reasons , the insu@@ red was put at the disposal of the Second District Court and the sent@@ enced person continues to be a prison@@ er at the Center for Sup@@ porting the Legal Con@@ sequ@@ ences of the Cri@@ me .
There must be made contributions to works
The social works referred to in the programs such as Hab@@ it@@ at , Res@@ cu@@ e of Public Sp@@ aces and 3@@ x@@ 1 for migrants risk not to be completed or to have serious delays due to the lack of funds , said Miguel An@@ gel L@@ op@@ ez Mir@@ anda .
The Director of Municip@@ al Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at risk because the State Government failed to make the contributions that correspond , which represent a resource superior to 11 million p@@ es@@ os in all three programs .
He noted that the total investment in these three programs is of nearly 50 million p@@ es@@ os , of which the State has to contribute with 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municip@@ ality have provided resources for the works , so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force .
&quot; They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a di@@ me , since starting with July they had to give us a part , &quot; he said , &quot; in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced , but we need the money . &quot;
He mentioned that last year , during the administration of Jesus A@@ guil@@ ar Pa@@ di@@ lla , the State did not comply with the contributions it had to make , so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to bor@@ row money in order to cover more than 7 million , a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration .
&quot; It happened to us in the previous administration because the State did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advan@@ cing , and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending , &quot; he explained .
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources , he said that the request was made ​ ​ to the Secretary of Administration and Finance , Ar@@ mand@@ o Vil@@ lar@@ real , to speed up the efforts so that the percent@@ ages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible .
&quot; They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a di@@ me . &quot;
The court vali@@ dates &quot; digital television transition &quot; in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice ( SC@@ J ) rejected the constitutional controversi@@ es brought by the Sen@@ ate and House of Represent@@ atives against the presidential decre@@ e that brings forward the so-called &quot; digital television transition &quot; from 20@@ 21 to 2015 , since the eight votes needed to invali@@ date it were not obtained .
A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Court , Juan Sil@@ va Me@@ za , considered that President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on did not exceed his authority by issuing a decre@@ e deta@@ iling the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital ter@@ restri@@ al television .
With this result , the constitutional contro@@ vers@@ y promoted by the Sen@@ ate , was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pron@@ ounce on the constitu@@ tionality or un@@ constitu@@ tionality of the decre@@ e , and this remains in force .
The sentence project prepared by the Minister Ol@@ ga S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o , proposed to declare un@@ constitutional the decre@@ e , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telec@@ omm@@ unications Commission ( Co@@ fe@@ tel ) , in violation of the principles of hierarch@@ ical sub@@ ordin@@ ation and law reserve .
Only Z@@ al@@ di@@ var , Jor@@ ge Mario Par@@ do , Mar@@ gar@@ ita L@@ una and S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o voted for the project .
With this argument , both the Sen@@ ate and the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties promoted two constitutional controversi@@ es to contradi@@ ct the decre@@ e , and to support the claims , the minister S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o suspended the application of the decre@@ e and all actions stipul@@ ated there regarding the digital transition .
At the ministers &quot; meeting there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , without entering into the discussion of the project , also in charge of the minister S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o .
In his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
&quot; Nor do I consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body , &quot; and rec@@ alled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive , who has a constitutional mandate , the guidance of the State .
The replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and results in a better utili@@ zation of the radi@@ o-@@ electric spectrum , better signal quality and more channels .
Del@@ a@@ ying the change , he said , would mean dela@@ ying the benefits of di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ation , which involves a public interest decision , which has not only a technical dimension , &quot; as it covers economic , social , political and national security issues . &quot;
These issues , he said , &quot; require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship , comprises a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the state executive power . &quot;
He rec@@ alled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition , and has done it through the executive , despite of having highly specialized technical bodies .
There cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the con@@ tested decre@@ e , that inv@@ ades in any way the competence of the Congress , is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the Leg@@ islat@@ ure , he said .
They analy@@ ze the possibility of a &quot; vote by vote &quot; count in Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ án
According to the data transmitted by the PER@@ P the difference between the first and second place in the gu@@ ber@@ nat@@ orial election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes corresponding to 8@@ 79 of the total of 6.@@ 0@@ 74 minutes .
The possibility of counting &quot; vote by vote &quot; is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ án , where according to the data obtained from the Pre@@ liminary Elec@@ toral Resul@@ ts Program ( PER@@ P ) the difference between the first and the second place of the govern@@ or &apos;s election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes that correspond to 8@@ 79 of the total 6.@@ 0@@ 74 minutes .
In this regard , the President of the General Council of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ án Elec@@ toral Institute ( ME@@ I ) , Maria de los Angeles L@@ l@@ ander@@ al Zar@@ ago@@ za , rec@@ alled that a few days ago , the last November 9th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmon@@ ize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .
As it will be rec@@ alled , Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ án did not authori@@ ze the Constitution or the Elec@@ toral Code of the State or the Elec@@ toral Justice Act , since the Congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the Govern@@ or Leon@@ el Go@@ do@@ y R@@ angel om@@ it@@ ted its publication within the periods specified in the Law in the State Official Gaz@@ ette , argu@@ ing that he had some objections .
The same November 9th , the Supreme Court of Justice ( SC@@ J ) resolved the constitutional contro@@ vers@@ y promoted by the local legislat@@ ure and described as &quot; invali@@ d and illegal &quot; the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms , since he has no right &quot; to san@@ ction or vote them . &quot;
Inter@@ viewed about the possibility of the &quot; vote by vote , &quot; Maria de los Angeles L@@ l@@ ander@@ al stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the General Council of the ME@@ I it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body .
Thus , the partial re@@ count of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assu@@ mp@@ tions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alter@@ ations of the minutes .
In addition , the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting , is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates .
The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position , case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial re@@ count .
There should be noted that in this situation is the election of Mo@@ reli@@ a , where according to PER@@ P the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.@@ 16 percent , even without counting the votes of 12@@ 9 of the 9@@ 23 total minutes .

Three bodies are found left in the NL Ca@@ der@@ ey@@ ta farm
H@@ ours before the discovery , the military authority presented in media ele@@ ven persons who were de@@ tained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime .
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace , in an abandoned farm of the municipality of Ca@@ der@@ ey@@ ta Jim@@ en@@ ez , Nu@@ evo Le@@ on .

Wednesday there will be formed the new Italian government
The appointed prime minister , Mario Monti , will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
The designated Italian prime minister , Mario Monti , will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has en@@ danger@@ ed the entire euro zone .
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti , named on Sunday , will meet on Wednesday with the president , Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ poli@@ tano , to confirm that he can form a government .
He is expected to present a cab@@ inet composed largely of te@@ chno@@ crats , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .
Monti said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government .
&quot; I want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase , &quot; said the former European commission@@ er to the re@@ por@@ ters .
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome .
The &quot; framework is now well del@@ ine@@ ated , &quot; he said .
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days , much less than the normal , while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to un@@ sustainable levels .
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders in order to reg@@ ain the confidence in Italy .
Under@@ lying the pressure on Monti to hur@@ ry , the inst@@ able markets put the yield of the Italian B@@ TP bonds to 10-@@ year above 7 percent , the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescu@@ ed .
E@@ mma Mar@@ c@@ eg@@ ag@@ lia , leader of the Italian employers &apos; Federation told the re@@ por@@ ters after meeting with Monti : &quot; We said we would support very much this government . &quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation .
Monti &apos;s chances of success were considerably boo@@ sted by the support of the L@@ DP party of Sil@@ vio Berlusconi , who was forced to re@@ sign on Saturday due to the crisis .
&quot; We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are dest@@ ined to have a good outcome , &quot; said to the re@@ por@@ ters Angel@@ ino Al@@ fan@@ o , secre@@ tary of the c@@ enter@@ -@@ right party .
The support of the L@@ DP , the largest party in Italy , is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of te@@ chno@@ crats that Monti is forming .
Parliamentary support
Monti &apos;s new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be un@@ popular austerity reforms .
Any block@@ age or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster .
Monti began on Monday his consultations with the political parties , unions and business groups , as well as with youth and women organizations .
He will end his meeting on Tuesday night .
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Na@@ poli@@ tano , who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis .
After a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that Berlusconi would re@@ sign , the Italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between un@@ certain@@ ties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .
Res@@ cu@@ ing Italy with a public debt of 1.@@ 8 billion Euros would be too much for the current financial def@@ enses of the euro zone .
Monti has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013 , despite the widespread predic@@ tions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections .
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cab@@ inet , but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technici@@ ans , an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure .
Political sources said that the mutual mi@@ str@@ ust and dis@@ agreement between the parties are complic@@ ating the attempt to include political figures .
The famili@@ arity of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ti@@ cos
Of the 22 players called in Spain , ten passed 50 international games .
On the side of Costa Rica only one of 22 called players reached 50 games .
A minor contrast to Costa Rica , compar@@ ing the 22 players called by both countries for the friendly game today , at 3 : 05 pm at the National Stadium in San J@@ ose .
While the world and Europe champ@@ ions , number one in the monthly top of FIFA , have a long record of Class A inter selection , the Tri@@ color has only the def@@ ender Michael U@@ man@@ a as the only one who has 50 international games .
That number was reached Friday before the game against Pan@@ ama ( 0-@@ 2 ) , in R@@ omm@@ el Fern@@ an@@ dez .
Spanish football players playing in the All-@@ Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in le@@ ague and local cup competitions and there are high-level sho@@ cks in the European C@@ ups and Champ@@ ions League .
To this is added the Spanish F@@ ury experience in complicated qualifications for Euro and World Cup .
The Ti@@ cos players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as CON@@ C@@ AC@@ A@@ F , which is considered the lowest level within FIFA
We see that the peak of the Spanish selection is the go@@ al@@ keep@@ er I@@ ker Casi@@ llas , who last Saturday against England ( game lost with 0-@@ 1 in London ) equ@@ aled the record of the ex go@@ al@@ keep@@ er An@@ don@@ i Z@@ ub@@ iz@@ arre@@ ta , with 12@@ 6 international matches .
Casi@@ llas will play today against the Tri@@ color and will impose a new record of 12@@ 7 international matches for Spain .
X@@ av@@ i Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , the player of Barcelona , has 10@@ 6 matches .
Casi@@ llas and X@@ av@@ i were recognized last week by U@@ EFA together with the other player of the Iber@@ ian team , Z@@ ub@@ iz@@ arre@@ ta with 12@@ 6 matches and Schal@@ ke stri@@ ker Rau@@ l Gonz@@ al@@ ez with 10@@ 2 .
Almost near the cent@@ enni@@ al number is Car@@ les Pu@@ y@@ ol , with 97 games .
X@@ ab@@ i Al@@ on@@ so follows them with 91 , Fern@@ ando Tor@@ res , with 90 , David Villa and Ser@@ gio Ram@@ os , both with 81 , And@@ res In@@ ie@@ sta , with 62 , Ces@@ c Fab@@ reg@@ as , with 61 , and David Sil@@ va , with 53 .
On Costa R@@ ican side , and close to Michael U@@ man@@ a , are the left-@@ lateral Junior Di@@ az , with 48 matches and the stri@@ ker Br@@ yan Ru@@ iz , with 45 .
After this , only five exceeded the 30 games : Kei@@ l@@ or Nav@@ as with 31 , Rand@@ all A@@ zo@@ fei@@ fa with 32 , Michael Bar@@ ran@@ tes with 31 , Carlos Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez with 36 and J@@ ose Lu@@ is L@@ op@@ ez with 35 .
The least .
More than 30 matches in Spain have Ger@@ ard Pi@@ qu@@ é ( 37 ) , Ser@@ gio Bus@@ qu@@ ets ( 36 ) , Santiago Sant@@ i C@@ az@@ or@@ la ( 32 ) , Al@@ var@@ o Ar@@ bel@@ o@@ a ( 31 ) and Rau@@ l Al@@ bi@@ ol ( 31 ) .
On the national side , with less than 30 pre@@ sen@@ ces , there are Ro@@ y Mil@@ ler with 26 , W@@ inst@@ on Parks with 26 , Gabri@@ el Ba@@ di@@ lla with 25 and Ro@@ y My@@ ri@@ e with 23 .
The rest doesn &apos;t come near the 20 .
While Nach@@ o Mo@@ real has only four games and Jord@@ i Alba two , in Costa Rica Vic@@ tor Boli@@ var has only one Ol@@ man Var@@ gas and N@@ elson Ed@@ der did not de@@ but yet .
The leading sc@@ orer of Spain is David Villa is , with 50 goals , followed by Fern@@ ando Tor@@ res with 27 .
For Costa Rica , Br@@ yan Ru@@ iz is the one that regi@@ sters more points , two more than Carlos Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez and three more than Ro@@ y My@@ ri@@ e and Parks .
Quin@@ tet included the country on the tour for celeb@@ rating two decades of experience
&apos;@@ Go@@ ing to Costa Rica is a dream come tru@@ e@@ &apos;
In an exclusive interview with Vi@@ va , the b@@ assist Je@@ ff A@@ ment , of Pear@@ l J@@ am , said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium .
There were more than 20 years of wait , but the band says that for the member is also a dream turned into reality playing in the country .
This was stated by the b@@ assist and founding member , Je@@ ff A@@ ment , who spoke exclusively with Vi@@ va , from Brazil , last week .
The group is on the South American zone within the tour celeb@@ rating two decades of work and Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America .
That day they will be present at the National Stadium , starting at 7 : 30 pm , together with the band of Los Angeles The X and the band of the nationals Las Rober@@ tas .
This is an exc@@ er@@ pt of the conversation , whose full trans@@ cript is online in The Nation .
For your fol@@ lo@@ wers from Costa Rica , is a dream come true that Pear@@ l J@@ am will play in Costa Rica ? Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing ?
Go@@ ing to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too .
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great .
I &apos;ve been to Costa Rica only once , on vacation , it is a beautiful country and I think we &apos;ll be able to stay a few days there .
So we are exc@@ ited to bring our music there .
I ask this because there is a kind of de@@ vo@@ tion to the band ; the fans live with intensity the days before the concert .
What do you say to your most fer@@ vent fol@@ lo@@ wers ?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years .
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here .
Some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year .
Does this add a bit of pressure on your visit ?
Some of the biggest shows we &apos;ve played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks .
We had a few wonderful shows in Sa@@ o Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica .
Re@@ ally , we are very e@@ ager to play there .
We love this country , we love to surf and the jung@@ le , for both things , Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world .
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing ?
We have many friends who are sur@@ fers and I have a great friend who lives in Tam@@ ar@@ in@@ do and the waves here are incredible .
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicar@@ agua , along with Mexico , these are great places to surf , and that &apos;s how we learned about , through people who love surfing .
Vie@@ wing the tour , one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs .
What have you planned for the presentation in Costa Rica ?
As we have never played there before , then we have no restrictions on what we can do .
We will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs ; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse re@@ pertoire .
You never repeat the re@@ pertoire .
How come ?
I think it &apos;s partly because we have nine disc@@ s and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs , so it &apos;s difficult to choose which songs to play every night .
When we have two or three songs in the re@@ pertoire that we have not been playing for a while , this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it remin@@ ds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten .
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people .
With this tour , you are celeb@@ rating 20 years of experience .
Looking back , is it hard to believe all you have made ?
Yes , absolutely .
First , I think none of us could ever imagine we &apos;d be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream .
We count our bl@@ ess@@ ings and we are very exc@@ ited that we can continue making music together .
We all love each other and love making music .
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go .
Th@@ ings could not be better for us .
What does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of gr@@ unge ?
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands .
We are good friends of the people of Sound@@ garden , Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey and Ali@@ ce in Cha@@ ins .
It &apos;s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual .
From time to time , arises a band of a city , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .
We are proud and hon@@ ored to be part of the Seattle group .
I still play with some of them from time to time .
Last year , we were at a festival with Ali@@ ce in Cha@@ ins and we were in Canada with Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey , we saw Sound@@ garden in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are hon@@ ored to be part of the Seattle sound that ar@@ ou@@ sed .
It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long .
Yes , four of us were together for 21 years and Mat@@ t ( Cam@@ eron ) joined us 13 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands la@@ sted .
First , I think we are all lucky to be still alive and , secondly , we all care about the others .
We are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been opened musical aven@@ ues that give each the freedom to experiment .
We trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better .
Your relationship to the word f@@ ame has not been easy ; but thanks to your success , you have been able to do whatever you wanted .
How do you find a balance ?
As we have grown , it has been easier to find a balance .
We take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crow@@ ds and people who love your music .
While one re@@ members that people are there for the music , that remin@@ ds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star , something that none of us really ca@@ res about .
How do you remember your other project Man@@ other Love B@@ one ?
I think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing .
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of An@@ dy ( Andrew W@@ oods ) .
There were many fru@@ strations because la@@ sted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bru@@ ce ( F@@ air-@@ weather ) and Gre@@ g ( Gil@@ more ) , who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that An@@ dy was and how he made ​ ​ me lau@@ gh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , lau@@ gh , talk about music and football and much more .
It was a remarkable man and we miss him .
The national band Las Rober@@ tas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica .
Is it true that you know its work , especially Ed@@ die V@@ ed@@ der , and that &apos;s why you chose it for the opening ?
Yes , the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most , so we &apos;re anxi@@ ous to see what Las Rober@@ tas can offer live and should be very enter@@ taining .
Why do you always change the ly@@ rics of Y@@ ellow L@@ ed@@ better live ?
That is a question for E@@ d ( Ed@@ die V@@ ed@@ der ) , so I do not know .
He s@@ ings it and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind .
As a b@@ assist , what are your influences ?
There are so many .
Within the first that come to my mind are Ge@@ e@@ zer But@@ ler , John Ent@@ wi@@ stle , C.@@ J. Ram@@ one , John Do@@ e , Paul Mc@@ C@@ art@@ ney , Ch@@ u@@ ck Du@@ ko@@ wski ...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the b@@ assi@@ sts that I love .
How did Pear@@ l J@@ am succeeded to maintain gr@@ unge relevant despite of not being any longer a f@@ ad ?
I think all of us feel a bit dis@@ connected from the word gr@@ unge .
When I think of it , it remin@@ ds me of the bands I mentioned before , like Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey , Sound@@ garden , N@@ ir@@ v@@ ana and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , I think it &apos;s wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey are making now music better than ever .
At first , your music had a dark@@ er content , and now has become more positive .
How do you explain this change ?
It &apos;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear ligh@@ ter , but there are songs like The End or Just Bre@@ a@@ the that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive .
With both , when E@@ d played them , I cri@@ ed when I heard them , and these songs are pro@@ found@@ ly dark .
I think that when you grow up and there was some trau@@ ma in your life and you lost a family member or friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me .
Also , I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark .

Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori was hosp@@ itali@@ zed again for medical tests
The ex President Alber@@ to Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori was hosp@@ itali@@ zed Tuesday in a public hospital in order to be evaluated for the loss of mus@@ cle strength that occurs in the legs , informed his family doctor .
Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori , 72 years old , who is sent@@ enced at 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government ( 199@@ 0-@@ 2000 ) , suff@@ ers from several ail@@ ments , including cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated four times and it is kept under control .
The con@@ gress@@ man Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro A@@ gu@@ in@@ aga , who is his personal physi@@ cian , told to Canal N of television that Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Ne@@ op@@ las@@ tic Dis@@ e@@ ases in order to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in his lower lim@@ bs .
A@@ gu@@ in@@ aga said that in his opinion Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori would be a candidate for getting the benefit of par@@ don on humanitarian grounds ; however , he said he did not want this because he knows he is innocent .
He had surgery four times for cancer of the tongue , has a weight loss of 18 ki@@ los to which other diseases were added such as severe ero@@ sive ga@@ stri@@ tis , pan@@ cre@@ atic c@@ yst@@ s , ki@@ dney stones , high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs , listed the doctor .
Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori is in prison since September 2007 in the Police National Department of Special Oper@@ ations .
In April 2009 he was sent@@ enced to 25 years of prison for killing 25 people at the hands of a squ@@ ad of anni@@ hil@@ ation of the army that operated c@@ lan@@ dest@@ inely in the early years of his government .
Mu@@ j@@ ica tra@@ vels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an President José Mu@@ j@@ ica , and composed of several ministers and business@@ men , will begin this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to approach political issues in the region .
Mu@@ j@@ ica will meet next Wednesday his Mexican equal , Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political , commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Urugu@@ ay@@ ans living in Mexico , according to the schedule released by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Presidency .
The meeting between both pre@@ sidents , in the city of Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara , will be &quot; favor@@ able for the exchange of information as regards the political issues between the two nations , &quot; as published the Presidency of the South American country on its website .
According to the local media , Mu@@ j@@ ica seeks to get Cal@@ der@@ on &apos;s support for Urugu@@ ay in the incident with France that aro@@ se when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy , included the South American country on a list of tax ha@@ vens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes .
In his speech , Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax ha@@ vens , a statement that caused the refusal of Urugu@@ ay and the call to consultation of its amb@@ assador in the European country .
Mexico pre@@ sides since November , the G20 , a group composed of the world &apos;s most powerful developed and emerging countries , and has in effect with the South American country since January this year , an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation .
The Urugu@@ ay@@ an government has attempted in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax ex@@ changing arrangements in order to leave the &quot; gra@@ y list &quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , composed of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation .
On the trade plan , Mexico and Urugu@@ ay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement ( FT@@ A ) that has increased the exchange of goods between both countries .
The mu@@ st@@ ach@@ i@@ o@@ ed pl@@ um@@ ber comes to be three-@@ dimensional with &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot;
Super Mario has fought ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly for over 25 years to save Princ@@ ess P@@ each from the evil cl@@ ut@@ ches of Bo@@ wser , but never before he had done this in three dimensions : in &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; he will fight for the love of the girl in ster@@ e@@ o@@ scop@@ ic technology .
The title , which arri@@ ves in the stores around the world this month , has been designed to exploit the features of the po@@ table console N@@ inten@@ do 3@@ DS , which allows playing in three dimensions without the need of using gl@@ asses .
&quot; Mario is the character who has to say how it should work the ster@@ e@@ o@@ scop@@ y without gl@@ asses , &quot; said the press head of N@@ inten@@ do in Spain , O@@ mar Al@@ v@@ are@@ z , during the presentation of the game in Madrid .
Al@@ v@@ are@@ z said that &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; is &quot; the first video game of N@@ inten@@ do originally designed for this support , &quot; because until now successes like &quot; Star Fox 64 3D &quot; or &quot; Z@@ el@@ da : O@@ car@@ ina of Time 3D &quot; were adap@@ tations of existing titles .
N@@ inten@@ do spo@@ kes@@ man has claimed that , despite being in 3D , &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; is an &quot; accessible &quot; video game which allows enjoying a quick and flu@@ id game .
Al@@ v@@ are@@ z said that &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; contains two games in one : the first part is &quot; simple &quot; to engage less skilled users .
Once past@@ ed , most experts will give a &quot; second round &quot; to the levels of the play , which this time , are more difficult .
In addition , the users can choose in real-time between &quot; D aggressive &quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action , but will need to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &quot; not to succ@@ um@@ b optical illu@@ sions . &quot;

Colo@@ m guarantees Por@@ ti@@ llo &apos;s extra@@ dition to the United States
President Al@@ var@@ o Colo@@ m said on Tuesday that the extra@@ dition process of the ex leader Al@@ fon@@ so Por@@ ti@@ llo has begun in order to respond in the United States of la@@ undering $ 70 million .
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of north country that claimed for Por@@ ti@@ llo to judge him there .
At a press conference , Colo@@ m said that his decision is according to the independence of judiciary and executive powers , taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the extra@@ dition .
He stated that during his mandate he did not &quot; put his hands &quot; in judicial decisions and accepted all extra@@ dition proceedings he has ever known .
In addition to Por@@ ti@@ llo , Ser@@ gio Ru@@ ano Mar@@ ro@@ qu@@ in will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted for murder and serious injury , and Ed@@ gar E@@ stra@@ da Mor@@ ales and Vic@@ tor E@@ stra@@ da P@@ are@@ des , both for drug traffic .
What &apos;s done by Colo@@ m represents an executive process after getting exhau@@ sted all legal and constitutional courts to prosec@@ ute the ex head of state between 2000 and 2004 .
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fif@@ th Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court ( CC ) , Por@@ ti@@ llo will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted once resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteed his human rights .
Por@@ ti@@ llo was acqu@@ it@@ ted of em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of Q@@ 120 million in the Def@@ ense Ministry when he was a president , which was the process that prec@@ eded the extra@@ dition , but the Public Ministry appe@@ aled and re@@ opened the case .
Tr@@ ini@@ jo@@ ve has helped 6@@ ,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to prevent the fall on the mar@@ gins of the society of un@@ trained young men
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Tr@@ ini@@ jo@@ ve is important : 6@@ ,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter .
To this there are added over a hundred jobs currently created ​ ​ for this social group .
The anniversary served to make a balance at a ceremony held in the old factory complex Fab@@ ra i Co@@ ats where attended over 300 people .
Tr@@ ini@@ jo@@ ve was born in the neighborhood of Trin@@ it@@ at V@@ ella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education , no job , and drug problems or at risk of falling into margin@@ ality .
The yesterday celebration at Sant Andre@@ u gathered a large number of responsible entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collabor@@ ated with the association .
The diverse political representation , in the election time , showed the un@@ it@@ ary character of the work done by Tr@@ ini@@ jo@@ ve .
Next to the president of the Gener@@ ali@@ tat , Ar@@ tur M@@ as , and his predecessor Jord@@ i Pu@@ jo@@ l , attended the ceremony the ex coun@@ sel@@ or of Socialist Education , Ern@@ est Mar@@ ag@@ all , and the ex lie@@ utenant of the may@@ or and current ec@@ o socialist Coun@@ c@@ il@@ man Ric@@ ard Gom@@ a .
Also attended at the Fab@@ ra i Co@@ ats the actual Coun@@ sel@@ or for Social Wel@@ fare and Family , Jose@@ p L@@ lu@@ í@@ s Cl@@ eries and CEO of the social work of La Ca@@ i@@ x@@ a , J@@ au@@ me Lan@@ asp@@ a .
He said Tr@@ ini@@ jo@@ ve was born in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult , but added that the work done so far &quot; is a good base . &quot;
The president gave Tr@@ ini@@ jo@@ ve as an example for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties .
&quot; The crisis is not new to the entity and the work done by it , &quot; he said .
An occupied farm where mac@@ ro parties were given was ev@@ acu@@ ated
The inv@@ aders had sei@@ zed 11 of the 13 floors of the building , Bal@@ mes , 51
The 12 occup@@ ants left the farm at noon yesterday without a fight
It seems that the night@@ mare lived by the neighb@@ ors re@@ sid@@ ing in 51 Bal@@ mes Street has come to an end .
T@@ welve people left volun@@ t@@ arily yesterday at noon the property they were illegally occup@@ ying , and where they organized mac@@ ro parties that ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated the neighborhood , by court order without police intervention .
When the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to prevent a repeat of the situation .
&quot; From now on there will be an access control , &quot; said the manager .
The squ@@ at@@ ters , who had inv@@ aded 11 of the 13 floors of the building , the rest are inhabit@@ ed@@ - took all the wir@@ ing and part of the water , painted the walls and left resi@@ du@@ es of all kinds , especially alcoholi@@ c be@@ verage cans .
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties , which la@@ sted up to two days and ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated the ten@@ ants .
Next to the building there is a night@@ club , Bal@@ mes 51 , which has also been damaged .
The owner , Maria P@@ ant@@ in@@ at told to Europa Press that since the building was occupied her business went down 80 % .
The owner of the club says that the inv@@ aders of the farm made ​ ​ her an unfair competition , since they were selling drinks for three Euros , while in the club worth 10 .
In addition , the owner of the disc@@ o had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise , while , as she noted , the noise was not caused by customers of the club , but by the inhabitants of the squ@@ at and , above all , those attending the parties that were organized there , which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks , as the an@@ gr@@ y neighb@@ ors said .
The head of the club said that the dis@@ comfort was so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and there are now nine months since she &quot; for@@ gives &quot; him for paying the rent .
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neighb@@ ors about the situation .
The chairman of the PP municipal group , of the council Alber@@ to Fern@@ án@@ dez D@@ í@@ az , had claimed last week &quot; to immediately ev@@ acu@@ ate the building in order to solve the problems of co@@ existence and community spirit caused to neighb@@ ors , and the degra@@ dation of the area . &quot;
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied , but over the last few months the squ@@ at@@ ters had entered into all floors and in almost every floor and that in some of them occurred bur@@ gl@@ aries .
In this sense , he added that &quot; it is necessary to put an end to imp@@ unity and to be strongly against the in@@ civili@@ ty that has been generated on the farm . &quot;
Also yesterday , the members of the police ev@@ acu@@ ated a building in N@@ ou Bar@@ ris .
At 15 : 30 the police went to 35 Mon@@ tra@@ l Street after receiving a call from a neighb@@ or who had noticed that four people had entered the building .
The four were arrested at the time .
Park or mountain ?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversi@@ es over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors re@@ opened the debate on the role of Coll@@ ser@@ ola in Barcelona
In mid 80 &apos;s at the height of the now ext@@ inc@@ t Metro@@ politan Corporation of Barcelona ( M@@ C@@ B ) , this Administration printed promotional le@@ af@@ lets of Coll@@ ser@@ ola .
The book@@ let defined the mountain as the great park of the metro@@ politan Barcelona .
Moreover , it was accompanied by a comparison , in figures , with the New York Central Park .
On the death of the M@@ C@@ B , in 1987 , the park was placed again in the minds of many , as the upper limit of Barcelona , ​ ​ being the Catal@@ an capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north-@@ south but up ( mountain ) -@@ down ( sea ) .
The classification of Coll@@ ser@@ ola as a natural park re@@ do@@ unds in this idea .
The reference was not Central Park , but Y@@ el@@ low@@ stone , with the wild bo@@ ar on the role of Yo@@ gi Be@@ ar .
This was all about until , in September , the council called for a me@@ ga competition composed of 16 con@@ tests for as many other doors to Coll@@ ser@@ ola .
A door refers to the idea of the park , no doubt .
Ei@@ ther that or someone wants to put gates to the field .
The question comes alone : Coll@@ ser@@ ola ? Park or mountain ?
The competition , both as for its merely organiz@@ ational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona .
It &apos;s almost a recur@@ rent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lin@@ e@@ age of elected persons recognize themselves in an elev@@ ator .
And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few simil@@ arities between what three architects of Barcelona are saying and the academ@@ ics , which have been presented .
Miguel Rol@@ dan , Daniel Mod@@ olo and Mar@@ a Bay@@ ona : the competition is appropriate
For Rol@@ and , after approaching the coastline becomes &quot; necessary &quot; to discuss about &quot; the mountain front , &quot; whenever Il@@ def@@ ons Cer@@ da &apos;s speech , that of green ap@@ ples has not been carried out .
&quot; It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach .
Among other things , for its great accessibility .
Coll@@ ser@@ ola is more complex , &quot; says the architect to whom the title of &quot; gates of Coll@@ ser@@ ola &quot; contains a &quot; le@@ x@@ ical tra@@ p &quot; : we should not think about them &quot; as access to a park , but as the deli@@ mit@@ ation of some areas where we must act . &quot;
Mod@@ olo , as Rol@@ and and Bay@@ ona with experience in the urban world , called the proposal &quot; intellectual challenge &quot; with &quot; some dangers . &quot;
H@@ az@@ ards arising from the &quot; uncertainty of projec@@ ting the public space &quot; after the experience of the 80 &quot; s which had in the Forum area &quot; his s@@ wan song . &quot;
The first fear is the own deli@@ mit@@ ation of the borders where to build .
&quot; Lim@@ iting something is setting up the next step , &quot; meaning , over@@ coming .
&quot; We must think of new urban planning tools , because the current &#91; in reference to the General Metro@@ politan Plan ( GM@@ P ) &#93; can lead to a real disaster . &quot;
Ti@@ ghter to the question , Mod@@ olo believes that simpli@@ fying the Coll@@ ser@@ ola valley side &quot; can be understood as a park , Barcelona , ​ ​ not &quot; by a purely to@@ po@@ graphical issue .
Mod@@ olo re@@ members that there is already a work done by the Board of Coll@@ ser@@ ola that &quot; should not fall on dea@@ f ears , &quot; although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project &quot; from the very beginning . &quot;
And further , understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate , but &quot; he doubts &quot; about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multi@@ disciplinary teams ( &quot; a success , &quot; he points ) that have had to create : &quot; The architects should be only a tool . &quot;
Bay@@ ona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex , because the contest rules lack a global view of Coll@@ ser@@ ola : &quot; 16 cross con@@ tests have been called -@@ he sa@@ y@@ s-@@ on se@@ a@@ - mountain sense , but there is no long@@ it@@ u@@ din@@ al reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . &quot;
This leads , at least in this case , to have chosen to participate in the 16 con@@ tests .
Otherwise , a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate .
In your opinion , the council should ensure that the band immediately above the Ron@@ da de D@@ alt should provide in its enti@@ rety , an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .
Casino for@@ gives Jon@@ as Lar@@ ra@@ z@@ ab@@ al and this one will be free
After 72 days of arrangements , the legal representative of the Red Casino for@@ gave the brother of the may@@ or of Monter@@ rey of the process against him for alleged ex@@ tor@@ tion
After spending 72 days in j@@ ail , Manuel Jon@@ as Lar@@ ra@@ z@@ ab@@ al will be free after the legal representative of the Red Casino granted him for@@ gi@@ veness before the Second Criminal Court District , which follows a process of black@@ mail against the brother of the may@@ or of Monter@@ rey .
After the bom@@ bing of Casino Roy@@ ale , Red Casino owner , Ser@@ gio G@@ il Gar@@ cia , made ​ ​ public a series of photographs and videos where alle@@ ge@@ dly Manuel Jon@@ as required him to pay an economic fee so that the city hall of Monter@@ rey allows the c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine operation of the bet house .
After the public condemnation , the State General Att@@ or@@ ney opened a criminal case against the may@@ or &apos;s brother and on September 2nd , he was arrested and im@@ pris@@ oned for 30 days .
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry for Heritage Cri@@ mes , he was transferred to the Tem@@ por@@ ary J@@ ail , located in the Old Neigh@@ bor@@ hood of the state capital .
In this place he remained for 49 days following the pron@@ unci@@ ation of a second restriction order after the prosec@@ utor dis@@ missed the crimes of bri@@ ber@@ y and organized crime .
On October 19th he was transferred to Ca@@ der@@ ey@@ ta alle@@ ge@@ dly for black@@ mailing with a half million of p@@ es@@ os the owners of Red Casino , but he stayed there only a few hours in the medium-@@ security prison because there were death threats against him .
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells boarding San Nicolas of Gar@@ za .
On October 25@@ th he an arrest order was issued by the c@@ ler@@ k of Second Criminal District Court , Jor@@ ge Y@@ an@@ ez , who said that after nearly two months of in@@ quiries there was enough evidence to establish the gu@@ ilt of Jon@@ as , such as the collection of 1.5 million p@@ es@@ os from the representatives of the book@@ maker in exchange for allowing the operation of it .
On Monday , the legal representative of Red Casino , Vic@@ tor Al@@ do Gar@@ cia Gom@@ ez , appeared before the judge José Lu@@ is P@@ ec@@ ina to seek par@@ don for the regional may@@ or &apos;s brother , so that in the coming hours he might reg@@ ain his freedom .
During the legal di@@ ligence , the public prosec@@ utor attached to the Court , Ram@@ ir@@ o Ari@@ as , ques@@ tioned Gar@@ cia Gom@@ ez whether he had repa@@ ired the damage and which of the partners of the betting house granted par@@ don , although the lawyer tried to reserve the name .
Based on the record 19@@ 7 / 2011 legal par@@ don is granted to Jon@@ as Lar@@ ra@@ z@@ ab@@ al and there@@ after there may not be made ​ ​ any claim about the process that was intended against him ; also no damage repair or punishment will be required .
After the hearing of the legal representative of the book@@ mark@@ ers , at almost 15 : 50 it was ordered the immediate release of Lar@@ ra@@ z@@ ab@@ al Bre@@ ton .
The c@@ ler@@ k of the court , Jor@@ ge Y@@ an@@ ez , went to the j@@ ail of the municipality of San Nicolas of Gar@@ za to notify Jon@@ ah that he has been legally par@@ don@@ ed and his record will be filed .
Also he will notify him about the immediate release order issued by the judge .
The Secretary Di@@ on@@ isi@@ o Per@@ ez Jac@@ ome gives details of the crash where the Inter@@ ior Minister , Francisco B@@ lake , and seven others died .
The Ministry of Communications and Transpor@@ tation ( M@@ C@@ T ) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the Inter@@ ior Secretary Francisco B@@ lake Mor@@ a , and seven others died , indicate that the helicop@@ ter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity , without the pilot attempting a forced landing .
During a press conference , Di@@ on@@ isi@@ o Per@@ ez Jac@@ ome , Minister of Communications and Transport , said that before the aircraft took off , the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight .
&quot; The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the bla@@ des came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the f@@ us@@ el@@ age . &quot;
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .
He also said that the investigations made ​ ​ in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .
&quot; In a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place , the impact is presented in a structural way .
&quot; The design of the helicop@@ ter conceived for 19 passengers , fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transpor@@ ting passengers .
The land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees .
For now , the secre@@ tary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year .
Meanwhile , Gil@@ ber@@ to L@@ op@@ ez Me@@ yer , general director of Air@@ ports and Au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary Services , said that at the time of the impact , the Presiden@@ tial helicop@@ ter was operating in cru@@ ising speed and that this happened in a soft as@@ c@@ ending land .
&quot; This information rein@@ forces the hy@@ pothe@@ sis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact , &quot; he said .
At the press conference , the owner of the SC@@ T , Per@@ ez Jac@@ ome , listed six important elements in the investigation :
Visual flight :
According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
We@@ ather Conditions :
A@@ IC@@ M reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clou@@ ds at low al@@ ti@@ tudes .
S@@ elected routes :
It is likely that due to clou@@ d conditions the crew has sear@@ ched an area of lower elev@@ ation and greater visibility into the valley of Cu@@ ern@@ av@@ aca .
Location of the impact .
The coordin@@ ates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft ra@@ dar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .
Dis@@ per@@ sion of w@@ reck@@ age on a small area :
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line .
The disp@@ er@@ sion of the w@@ reck@@ age suggests that the helicop@@ ter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity .
There was not detected evidence of fire or explosion :
On the area of the accident there remains un@@ dis@@ closed evidence in the w@@ reck@@ age of the craft , some kind of explosion or fire .
Rec@@ ent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground .
During the field work there have been found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9.@@ 200 feet above mean sea level , the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees .
The pictures show the sequence in which it disman@@ tled along that journey .
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicop@@ ter may have had multiple imp@@ acts with the ground .
After a thorough research in a wider area than the sur@@ rendered off area , near the place the accident took place , there have not been found scat@@ tered pieces of the aircraft , which strength@@ ens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .
MS@@ S announ@@ ces a protocol for finding obe@@ sity gene
Social Security direc@@ ts a research to find the gene for obe@@ sity in children and young people ; it is supported by specialists from the IP@@ N
The Mexican Social Security Institute ( M@@ SS@@ I ) has announced that conduc@@ ts a research to discover the gene for obe@@ sity in children and young people , called the protocol of &apos; Gene@@ tics of obe@@ sity in childhood and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence &apos; , which will provide counting on mark@@ ers associated with over@@ weight .
In a statement , the head of the Medical Research Unit in Bio@@ chem@@ istry of Speci@@ alties Hospital , XX@@ I Century National Medical Center , Miguel Cruz L@@ op@@ ez , explained that it was integrated a multi@@ disciplinary team of physi@@ cians , nur@@ ses , nutri@@ tion@@ ists and social workers .
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health ( N@@ IP@@ H ) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies ( C@@ invest@@ a@@ v ) National Poly@@ techn@@ ic Institute ( N@@ P@@ I ) .
The research invites the population entitled or not , to participate by going to the participant sport units of the M@@ SS@@ I in the Valley of Mexico , where there will be carried out the tests to children , every Saturday from 8 : 00 o &apos;@@ clock .
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cu@@ au@@ ht@@ é@@ mo@@ c sports unit ( West Mexico State ) and since October 8th , the activity takes place in the Netz@@ ah@@ u@@ alco@@ y@@ ot@@ l Sport unit ( East State of Mexico ) .
Once reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children , the study will continue in the Inde@@ pendence Sport Unit ( South the Mexico City ) and finally in the Mo@@ re@@ los Sports Unit ( North the Mexico City ) .
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of gene@@ tics in relation to the development of obe@@ sity and identify in children and young Mex@@ ic@@ ans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic de@@ gener@@ ative diseases .
On November 14th , there will be celebrated the World Di@@ abetes Day , and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years , with the consent and par@@ ental supervision for the implementation of specific question@@ nai@@ res on food .
They will also be asked about physical activity and family her@@ edi@@ tary history of disease , in order to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as di@@ abetes or ki@@ dney failure .
He explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied anth@@ rop@@ om@@ etric measurements ( weight , height , and wa@@ ist circum@@ ference ) , blood pressure measurements , and determination of glu@@ co@@ se , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ des , ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol and insu@@ lin and genetic ( seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obe@@ sity ) .
Cruz L@@ op@@ ez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .
Health Sur@@ ve@@ ys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 77 percent were o@@ bes@@ e , and 47 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of over@@ weight there was also observed a dramatic rise , &quot; said the specialist of the M@@ SS@@ I .
He said the justification for searching the mark@@ ers is based on that the population of the country diff@@ ers from other in its genetic history .
He reported that on average , the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage , 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with di@@ abetes and over@@ weight .
He explained that generally , the gene@@ tics of obe@@ sity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consu@@ me ( cal@@ ories ) and which is stored as fat .
The resear@@ cher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of over@@ weight or obe@@ sity .
Even , he said , the presence of dark@@ -@@ colo@@ red fol@@ ds ( ac@@ anth@@ uses ) on the neck and fore@@ arm indicates the li@@ ke@@ lihood of suffering of met@@ abo@@ lic dis@@ orders and even predi@@ abetes .
The information is handled with confidentiality , doctors deliver it in writing to the parents , to whom they explain each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease .
Cruz L@@ op@@ ez explained that there are three major components that cause over@@ weight , obe@@ sity and other chronic diseases : se@@ dent@@ ary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .
Also it is due to the high cal@@ or@@ ic in@@ take , meaning , and the increased consumption of sug@@ ary drinks , car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate ( tam@@ ales , bread , p@@ izza , ham@@ burger , etc . ) with high fat and protein and gene@@ tics analy@@ zed in this protocol .
UN@@ AM asp@@ halt would avoid po@@ th@@ ol@@ es
Raf@@ ael Herr@@ era , a resear@@ cher at the Fac@@ ul@@ ty of Chem@@ istry of UN@@ AM , develops poly@@ mer@@ -@@ modified asp@@ halt to produce a mixture with the best performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand po@@ th@@ ol@@ es every ra@@ iny season in the Metro@@ politan Area of Valley of Mexico , said Raf@@ ael Herr@@ era Na@@ j@@ era , a resear@@ cher at the Chem@@ istry Fac@@ ul@@ ty ( C@@ F ) of the UN@@ AM , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asp@@ halt p@@ av@@ ement is adequate , the po@@ th@@ ol@@ es could be reduced or even completely eliminated .
In his lec@@ ture A technological view of the po@@ th@@ ole , issued under the International Year of Chem@@ istry , announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a poly@@ mer modified asp@@ halt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asp@@ halt , but with a better mechanical strength , both at high and low temperatures .
Herr@@ era N@@ á@@ j@@ era said that this type of modified asp@@ halt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities in the north , to improve its performance and , therefore , the formation of po@@ th@@ ol@@ es .
He explained that the asp@@ halt , the heavi@@ er oil part is a set of hydro@@ carbon molec@@ ules , some of high molec@@ ular weight , called asp@@ halten@@ es , and other of low molec@@ ular weight , called mal@@ ten@@ es , which together give the road surface its vis@@ co@@ elas@@ tic characteristic behavior .
The vis@@ co@@ elas@@ tic behavior of the asp@@ halt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees , it beha@@ ves like a liquid at 120 ° C , its vis@@ co@@ sity is very high and at 50 degrees Cel@@ sius has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asp@@ halt becomes fragile , he said .
This means that the resistance of the street asp@@ halt is not uniform , but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering .
C@@ F resear@@ cher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible p@@ av@@ ement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asp@@ halt .
Among the most super@@ ficial layers is the asp@@ halt , composed of small stones di@@ pped into the asp@@ halt and then comp@@ acted .
Each of the stones which com@@ pose this covering , he said , is di@@ pped with asp@@ halt .
When driving vehicles and generating effort , it allows the forces to spread very well on the p@@ av@@ ement .
If it were modified asp@@ halt it would spread even better , said the chemical engineer .
On the asp@@ halt covering , he added , is placed a final layer called rolling covering , which is made ​ ​ of a fine stone material , meaning sand also di@@ pped into the asp@@ halt .
Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asp@@ halt covering and provide road fri@@ ction .
As being the part of the p@@ av@@ ement that will receive and diff@@ use the efforts , the rolling covering also requires proper thi@@ ckness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration .
The weather , especially hum@@ i@@ dity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it greatly affects the performance of the asp@@ halt .
When the ground is wet , water diff@@ uses inside the covering and it &apos;s hard to get out , this causing a sof@@ tening of all layers of the p@@ av@@ ement and , therefore , the formation of po@@ th@@ ol@@ es .
In the formation of a po@@ th@@ ole , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asp@@ halt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs .
Also a member of the National System of Res@@ ear@@ chers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of po@@ th@@ ol@@ es and , therefore , the thi@@ ckness of each layer of the p@@ av@@ ement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment , in order to prevent the frequent formation of po@@ th@@ ol@@ es .
Raf@@ ael Herr@@ era said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asp@@ halt , for example , asp@@ halt em@@ ul@@ sions , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair po@@ th@@ ol@@ es with eas@@ iness and without using high temperatures .
What did the candidate of Valley lack to be the new Mis@@ s Colombia ?
Analy@@ sis of the factors that affected S@@ ern@@ a Mel@@ ina Ram@@ i@@ rez for not getting the cro@@ wn of Mis@@ s Colombia .
The Valley gets its title number 14 of pr@@ inc@@ ess .
Once again Cau@@ ca Valley remains with the desire of the cro@@ wn of Mis@@ s Colombia .
This time Mel@@ ina Ram@@ i@@ rez S@@ ern@@ a had to be content with being on the winning po@@ dium , wearing the silver cro@@ wn and the band that accredi@@ ted her as the new pr@@ inc@@ ess of Colombia .
With the result obtained last night in Car@@ ta@@ gen@@ a , where Mis@@ s Atlantic won the cro@@ wn and scep@@ ter , the department counts with 14 Princ@@ ess titles and Mel@@ ina jo@@ ins the legi@@ on of women of Valley of Cau@@ ca who have been close to the cro@@ wn but were proc@@ laimed pr@@ inc@@ esses , among them Mi@@ ri@@ am O@@ sp@@ ina Ben@@ o@@ it ( 1947 ) , Clar@@ a Bor@@ r@@ ero Dom@@ ingu@@ ez ( 1949 ) , Patri@@ cia Bell@@ ini Ay@@ ala ( 1979 ) , Lor@@ ena Á@@ lv@@ are@@ z ( 1981 ) , Rose Mary Alz@@ ate ( 1983 ) , Ol@@ ga Maria Ar@@ en@@ as ( 1987 ) , Lei@@ la Blan@@ que ( 1988 ) , Mon@@ ica E@@ vers ( 1989 ) , Maria Consu@@ ela P@@ ine@@ do ( 1990 ) , Di@@ ana Isa@@ bel Rom@@ ero ( 1993 ) , G@@ is@@ elle Al@@ j@@ ure Garc@@ és ( 2000 ) , Catal@@ ina Gir@@ al@@ do ( 2007 ) , Steph@@ an@@ ie Garc@@ és Al@@ j@@ ure ( 2008 ) .
Now the big question many are asking is :
What was missing ? Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Mis@@ s Colombia , not in v@@ ain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jo@@ lie F@@ ace of Vo@@ gue , titles that were obtained by que@@ ens as Tali@@ ana Var@@ gas or Nat@@ alia Nav@@ ar@@ ro , who took the cro@@ wn of Mis@@ s Colombia .
The first key factor in the decision of the jury to design@@ ate her as First Princ@@ ess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question &quot; &apos; What is the book that has marked you and why ? A@@ sk@@ ed ​ ​ by Martin M@@ uri@@ llo Gom@@ ez from the Liter@@ ary C@@ art Let &apos;s read .
To the question@@ er she answered
&quot; I read a lot , I believe a lot in literature , I think it is a form of cul@@ tu@@ rali@@ zation , and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is &quot; The little Prince &apos; is a pretty deep book .
Today I read &quot; Cri@@ me and Pun@@ ishment &apos; it is a book of universal literature that we all should read ; and now I &apos;m reading the book by I@@ ren@@ e N@@ em@@ i@@ rov@@ ski , a Russian , a beautiful book called &quot; The heat of blood . &apos; 
A response that the jury did not like due to the term &quot; cul@@ tu@@ rali@@ zation &apos; and second of all for not specifically expla@@ ining how each of the c@@ ited books have marked her .
But after the ceremony Mel@@ ina said she was calm and happy with the result &quot; the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen . &quot;
And for you all , please read a little bit , &apos; The Little Prince &apos; it is a great book &quot;
Among the launched hypo@@ th@@ eses it is said that Valley got bur@@ ned by favor@@ iti@@ sm .
A re@@ porter from Bo@@ got@@ a suggested that for being the preferred , the acc@@ laimed , and the candidate who received all preliminary awards ( O@@ ster food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional cost@@ ume , and M@@ other Queen ) , &quot; that ar@@ ou@@ sed the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y of the other candidates , stressed the qu@@ een and therefore she did not shine on stage .
And that was noted in her first appearance in swi@@ m@@ suit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening cor@@ on@@ ation .
Although in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lack@@ ed the strength and energy that Mag@@ dal@@ ena and At@@ l@@ án@@ tico representatives did show .
Ari@@ el Os@@ ori@@ o , a journalist of the program &quot; Like home &apos; , of the R@@ C@@ N channel said that the fact that Mel@@ ina was designated as pr@@ inc@@ ess &quot; means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the qu@@ een . &quot;
In addition , Valley lat@@ ely avoided talking to the press , and that was wrong .
Another hy@@ pothe@@ sis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Con@@ test .
This is why , two days before the election the international jury Lu@@ cy Dou@@ ghty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
&quot; Beauty is not enough for a Mis@@ s Colombia , we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , &quot; she said .
There is also a speculation that Valley sinn@@ ed for her defects on the post@@ eri@@ or and the fi@@ bro@@ sis that could be seen on her ab@@ d@@ omen , but it is contradi@@ ctory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate &apos; natural beauty &apos; with the health@@ ier body , good nutrition and responsible physical work .
The coach of the que@@ ens Jor@@ ge Her@@ n@@ án O@@ ro@@ z@@ co recogn@@ izes that Mel@@ ina did not have the best body , that there were better , &quot; but the problem of fi@@ bro@@ sis on the ab@@ d@@ omen , which for me was not very notic@@ eable , made her lose points the last day . &quot;
Meanwhile , the journalist Gui@@ do Ho@@ y@@ os , of Cro@@ mos magazine considers that the error of the Valley of Cau@@ ca were the sur@@ gical interventions she suffered .
&quot; The sur@@ ger@@ ies are fine , but Valley did not know how to do them .
Her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished .
For this award , which for the first time is given by the National Beauty Con@@ test , after the swi@@ m@@ suit par@@ ade a cru@@ el pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y was fulfilled last night , it was said that this was the fli@@ cker that Ra@@ y@@ m@@ und@@ o granted to Mel@@ ina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the cro@@ wn .
Re@@ ality or not , the fact is that Mel@@ ina today begins a year of re@@ ign , not as sovereign , but as a pr@@ inc@@ ess , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself .
However , she will go down in history as one of the que@@ ens that despite her overwhelming passage through Car@@ ta@@ gen@@ a , found difficulties in getting the cro@@ wn .
Such was the work of the person who identified the body of Al@@ fon@@ so Can@@ o
A Cal@@ i lo@@ pho@@ scop@@ ist entered into history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot; Al@@ fon@@ so Can@@ o .
The work of these officials is a key work .
On November 4th the lo@@ pho@@ scop@@ ist of Cal@@ i CT@@ I passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the F@@ ARC top leader , &quot; Al@@ fon@@ so Can@@ o , through the comparison of his finger@@ prints .
Of the seven lo@@ pho@@ scop@@ ists working in the branch of CT@@ I , this week it was the turn of &quot; availability &apos; for Ele@@ az@@ ar Gonz@@ al@@ ez , a man of Puerto Te@@ j@@ ada , who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation .
At the beginning of his career , Gonz@@ al@@ ez worked in municip@@ alities of Cho@@ c@@ ó , where he often had to go for more than five days in the jung@@ le to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified .
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and , after making the corresponding courses , he specialized in lo@@ pho@@ scop@@ y , which is the study of skin fri@@ ction , meaning the pal@@ ms of the hands and feet .
The week of Eli@@ az@@ ar &apos;s operation against ali@@ as Al@@ fon@@ so Can@@ o he was warned to take clothes only for three days .
Some@@ thing big was coming .
On Friday night he went from Cau@@ ca with a helicop@@ ter , to Pal@@ mir@@ a .
He knew he had to identify two cor@@ p@@ ses and one was suspec@@ ted to be of the man who led the world &apos;s oldest gu@@ er@@ ri@@ lla , so they asked him to take the ten print card of Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Le@@ ón S@@ á@@ enz ( his real name ) .
However , when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was , he did not recognize him by his physical appearance ; it was very different from that seen in the media .
He was without be@@ ard , dres@@ sed as a far@@ mer of the area , without gl@@ asses and much th@@ inner .
But the prints do not lie .
Ac@@ compan@@ ied by a Gal@@ ton@@ ian magn@@ i@@ fying glass , ink , a p@@ add@@ le and a f@@ las@@ h@@ light , Eli@@ az@@ ar compared the finger@@ prints of the cor@@ pse with those of the card .
His eye did not fail him : it was &quot; Al@@ fon@@ so Can@@ o &apos; .
That same night , the man from Puerto Te@@ j@@ ada was asked to confirm the defense minister , Juan Carlos Pin@@ z@@ ón , that it was the top leader of the F@@ ARC .
In search of the finger@@ print
For a finger@@ print specialist from Si@@ j@@ in of Cal@@ i the recognition made ​ ​ by the President Juan Manuel San@@ tos to Ele@@ az@@ ar Gonz@@ al@@ ez in the press conference for the operation against &quot; Can@@ o &apos; , is very significant .
Many people do not know our work .
The finger@@ printing science is an exact science , without error , which can be key solution in solving crimes .
Apart from the identification of bodies , the finger@@ printing specialists support research for crimes like the@@ ft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured .
When captured , many criminals have fa@@ ke cards or do not have papers .
We will take their finger@@ print and seek them in the database .
The resear@@ cher said that , in a case of the@@ ft , he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the th@@ ie@@ f had supported his hand on to take a safe full of je@@ wels and money .
&quot; The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print , but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the off@@ ender , who had participated in several rob@@ ber@@ ies &quot; he said .
The prints can also rule out or confirm sus@@ pects in murder cases .
They have recently found a dead man , with li@@ qu@@ or bot@@ tles around him .
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspec@@ ted of the crime and , indeed , a print on the bottle matched .
Although this does not guarantee that it was the mur@@ derer , it places him it in the murder scene .
A finger@@ print expert of CT@@ I explained that in objects &quot; foot@@ prints are drawn with chemical or physical re@@ agents . &quot;
When they appear there is used a p@@ add@@ le or tape to lift them .
After that , the prints are sent to Asi@@ f , which is the criminal database , or at the Regi@@ stry .
&quot; The problem is that there are still many un@@ documented Colom@@ bi@@ ans , &quot; said CT@@ I expert .
He clarified that not everything is as shown in CS@@ I television program .
Just as not everything that gli@@ t@@ ters is gold , not everything you touch turns into a foot@@ print .
However , if it can be used , the comparison is being made .
The &quot; an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; challenge the authorities in New York
H@@ und@@ reds of prote@@ sters were crow@@ ding round in front of Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti square to camp .
A part of the prote@@ sters listened to the evi@@ ction order and moved to a nearby park .
The members of the movement Occ@@ up@@ y Wall Street challeng@@ ed on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court order , in the Manhattan Square where they were ev@@ acu@@ ated at da@@ wn when trying to occup@@ y another park of the Big Apple .
H@@ und@@ reds of prote@@ sters crow@@ ded round the Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows &quot; the an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the evi@@ ction by occup@@ ying a park north the city where there have been made further arre@@ sts .
&quot; Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti , and through peaceful si@@ t-@@ ins and demonstrations , &quot; said one of the spo@@ kes@@ men of the movement &quot; Occ@@ up@@ y Wall Street , &quot; Mark Bra@@ y .
Bra@@ y explained that the response of the &quot; an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; to the ev@@ acu@@ ation of the camp issued personally by the may@@ or of New York , Michael Blo@@ om@@ berg , came to court , where Ju@@ dge Lu@@ cy B@@ ill@@ ings issued an order prohi@@ bit@@ ing the forced ev@@ acu@@ ation of the place and allowing the demonstr@@ ators to remain camp@@ ed .
In addition , the &quot; an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; proce@@ eded to the occupation of a new park located at the conf@@ lu@@ ence of the downtown Canal Street and Six@@ th Avenue , near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , which connects New York and New Jer@@ sey , owned by the parish of Trin@@ ity Church .
At least for one hour they were able to occup@@ y the place , but then the police came and proce@@ eded to arrest some of the prote@@ sters , although Bra@@ y could not confirm the precise number , while telling E@@ fe that he saw several journalists who were also hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed .
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camp@@ ed at that point , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to medi@@ ate with the police .
Meanwhile , Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti square , which is a priv@@ ately owned site , remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to examine the leg@@ ality of the ev@@ acu@@ ation of this morning .
Some of the prote@@ sters moved there were carrying and distribut@@ ing at that time copies of that court order and even they gave these copies to officers guar@@ ding the place , which led to &quot; some small confron@@ tations , &quot; said Bra@@ y , who claimed that some officers be@@ aten the demonstr@@ ators .
The court order prohi@@ bits the authorities to ev@@ acu@@ ate the members of Occ@@ up@@ y Wall Street and enforce &quot; laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohi@@ bit demonstr@@ ators reg@@ ain access to the park with shops and other property used before . &quot;
Mayor Blo@@ om@@ berg told re@@ por@@ ters that , because of that court order , the city had suspended the re@@ opening of the public space and prote@@ sters were informed , however , that local laws do not allow them to re-@@ install with camping shops and sleeping bags .
The coun@@ c@@ il@@ man personally defended the ev@@ acu@@ ation of the Zu@@ cc@@ ot@@ ti square carried out at da@@ wn , an operation in which about 200 arre@@ sts were made and this was decided so because prote@@ sters were &quot; viol@@ ating the law . &quot;
Blo@@ om@@ berg said he gave the order to ev@@ acu@@ ate the square because it was becoming &quot; a place where people did not come to protest , but to break the law and , in some cases , to do harm to others &quot; as &quot; Some businesses had received threats &apos; and neighb@@ ors fe@@ ared &quot; for the quality of life . &quot;
&quot; The ev@@ acu@@ ation of this morning was dis@@ gu@@ sting and shows that deep inside Blo@@ om@@ berg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers , &quot; added the spo@@ kes@@ man of the movement , who accused the may@@ or of &quot; dis@@ respect for the freedom of expression . &quot;
The responsible of &quot; Occ@@ up@@ y Wall Street &quot; also indicated that they intend to organize &quot; great de@@ eds &quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commem@@ or@@ ate the last two months of protests , which began on September 17th .
P@@ am@@ ela Ander@@ son will be Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael B@@ ub@@ le and other prominent Canadi@@ ans , she will appear on the television program &quot; It &apos;s a Rus@@ sell Pe@@ ters Christmas &quot; on December 1st
The Canadian P@@ am@@ ela Ander@@ son has been the assi@@ stant of T@@ im Al@@ len in &quot; Home Impro@@ vement &quot; life@@ guard in &quot; Bay@@ watch &quot; Bun@@ ny in &quot; Play@@ boy , &quot; the wife of rock musi@@ cian T@@ omm@@ y Lee and now , the ac@@ tress and model is the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show at the Canadian television .
The private television channel C@@ TV announced today that Ander@@ son , along with the &quot; cro@@ oner &quot; ( bal@@ la@@ d singer ) Michael B@@ ub@@ le and other prominent Canadi@@ ans , will appear on the television program &quot; It &apos;s a Rus@@ sell Pe@@ ters Christmas &quot; on December 1st , interpre@@ ting a very different Mary .
C@@ TV presented today images of the television show in which Ander@@ son , also known by the wide distribution over the internet of a porno@@ graphic home video where she appears together with her ​ ​ husband , the dru@@ mmer of &quot; Mö@@ t@@ ley C@@ rü@@ e , &quot; T@@ omm@@ y Lee , appears dres@@ sed as the Virgin Mary holding in a cri@@ b a dol@@ l depic@@ ting Jesus .
In the scene , Pe@@ ters , a well known Canadian com@@ edi@@ an of Indian origin who recently appeared as a present@@ er on the tour of &quot; My Viol@@ ent Tor@@ pe@@ do of Tru@@ th &quot; by Char@@ lie She@@ en appears as Joseph .
In addition to Ander@@ son and Pe@@ ters , the C@@ TV Christmas special show features the Canadian singer B@@ ub@@ le , who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argent@@ in@@ ean model Lu@@ is@@ ana L@@ op@@ il@@ ato , and he is not a stran@@ ger as regards the contro@@ vers@@ y .
Recently , B@@ ub@@ le called &quot; bit@@ ch &quot; the American Kim Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an during one of his concerts in New York .
Japan re@@ born after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5 % due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the down@@ ward spi@@ ral that began in March
Since last March , the Japanese economy was par@@ aly@@ zed , still recover@@ ing from the devastating earthquake , resulting in a nuclear crisis , the worst catastrop@@ he suffered by the Ni@@ pp@@ on country since the Second World War .
The first estimates of Tokyo government regarding the material losses amoun@@ ted to $ 300@@ ,000 million , a blow that , despite the difficult global context , seems to have di@@ mm@@ ed .
After three consec@@ utive quarters of dec@@ lines , the Gro@@ ss Dom@@ estic Product data between July and September helped to turn the page , definitely : GDP increased by 1.5 % compared to the previous quarter and by 6 % in ann@@ u@@ alized rate .
The one recorded in the second quarter , for the Japanese the Fis@@ cal Year begins in March 2012 - represents also the fastest rhyth@@ m of growth from January to March 2010 .
The recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas dev@@ ast@@ ated by the earthquake and the following ts@@ un@@ ami .
In fact , companies increased their investment by 1.1 % ver@@ sus 0.@@ 9 % decline in capital expendi@@ tures which was observed from January to March , the first decline after six months of un@@ interrupted increases .
However , the true re@@ vul@@ sion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Key@@ ne@@ sian impul@@ se that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strength@@ en-@@ or re@@ buil@@ d-@@ infrastructure , using of gaps to grow from scrat@@ ch .
Japan has aw@@ ak@@ ened , especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption , which now represents 60 % of the Japanese GDP .
This variable clim@@ bed 1 % , driven by the increase of expenditure for cars , tra@@ vels and leisure activities .
The sti@@ g@@ ma of the yen
Tokyo has entru@@ sted to the internal market , when the y@@ en-@@ the Ni@@ pp@@ on currency has become one of the &quot; refuge values &quot; chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the U.S. , a privilege that weigh@@ s like a stone in the accounts of export companies .
With a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad , a serious sla@@ p for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups .
To@@ y@@ ota or Sony , for example , bl@@ amed the yen for their weak results between July and September .
As markets continue their sie@@ ge of the peripheral countries of the EU , the Government of Yo@@ shi@@ hi@@ ko No@@ da does not lower the guard .
&quot; We must be vigil@@ ant to the risks that remain , such as the deterioration of some foreign economies , the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , &quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy , Mot@@ oh@@ is@@ a Fur@@ u@@ ka@@ wa .
And indeed , the perspectives are not encouraging .
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development ( OECD ) said that most member countries showed in September clear signs of economic slow@@ down .
The indicator that anticip@@ ates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are s@@ lowing .
Since it fell four ten@@ ths to 10@@ 0.@@ 4 points , compared to 10@@ 0.@@ 8 in August .
The euro zone even fell below the average , which is at the level of 100 , since it rus@@ hed eight ten@@ ths up to 9@@ 9.@@ 13 points .
Athens feeds back the doubts
Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s said that adjustments will be approved , but con@@ servatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty re@@ inst@@ ated in the parks , Greece is still ent@@ ang@@ led in the ma@@ ze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis .
The feeling that the &quot; consent &quot; of the new transitional government of H@@ ell@@ ene comes imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts .
While the new prime minister , Lu@@ kas Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be under@@ estimated for applying them , the leader of the conservative New Democracy party , Ant@@ on@@ is Sam@@ ar@@ as , ensured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiter@@ ated his demand for new elections scheduled on February 19th .
&quot; The main task of this Government is implementing the decisions of the summit of October 26@@ th , &quot; Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s said yesterday when opening a parliamentary debate that it will cul@@ min@@ ate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive .
A package of 24 programs to boost employment , reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax ev@@ asion will be the first initiatives .
However , the message of Sam@@ ar@@ as does not clear the doubts about his position : &quot; We are committed to helping the transitional government , but we are not committed to anything . &quot;
The Con@@ servative leader was one step further in his pul@@ se to the EU and the IMF , the entities that must un@@ free@@ ze the 8@@ ,000 million that Athens urgently needed , and made ​ ​ clear he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments .
But the European Commission , still having a n@@ app@@ y ra@@ sh by the impact caused by the all or nothing statement of the Pap@@ and@@ re@@ ou referendum , reiter@@ ated yesterday that its demand is clear : it will not un@@ lock the help if the new Government and the leaders of H@@ ell@@ ene major parties do not sign &quot; a written commitment without ambigu@@ ity and this as soon as possible . &quot;
The Economic Affairs spo@@ kes@@ man , Ama@@ de@@ u Al@@ ta@@ fa@@ j , said the tro@@ ika inspec@@ tors would return &quot; very soon &quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot; what has to be done to pay the sixth tran@@ che &quot; of 8@@ ,000 million , although there is no definite date .
The Greek h@@ ank still has a thread for the moment .
Mr@@ s. Sofia : &quot; They are instruments of progress and hope &quot;
The qu@@ een highlights the &quot; dominant &quot; place in Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot; has achieved a prominent place worldwide in the role of Micro@@ finance . &quot;
Queen Sofia rec@@ alled yesterday that the country has become over the last two decades the second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation ; whose &quot; essence &quot; she said lies in being an &quot; instrument for social progress , justice and hope for a better future for all humanity , based on trust in human beings . &quot;
The Queen opened yesterday the Fif@@ th Global Micro@@ credit Summit in Vall@@ ado@@ li@@ d with the belief that &quot; there is no doubt &quot; that such operations are &quot; absolutely essential &quot; to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015 , and , &quot; especially having as a goal hal@@ ving the volume of people living with less than a dollar per day , with this fix@@ ing the &quot; poverty line . &quot;
Spain is &quot; still working &quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries all over the world , and assumes the task with &quot; responsibility &quot; said Mr@@ s. Sofia , who hoped that the efforts and contributions origin@@ ated in the Summit , which will be held until Thursday , will &quot; ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people , and especially for women , &quot; the main beneficiaries of these loans .
There are &quot; many achievements &quot; and &quot; many challenges we are facing . &quot;
The Micro@@ credit Summit arises not only as a forum for debate , but also as a platform that promotes &quot; two basic goals . &quot;
Thus , His Maj@@ est@@ y explained that she hopes that at the end of 2015 , 175 million poor families will have acc@@ eded to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immer@@ sed .
The impul@@ se for the creation of mic@@ ro credits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot; has followed the path started years ago &quot; by Mu@@ ham@@ mad Y@@ un@@ us , highlighted Mr@@ s. Sofia as an &quot; act of justice and recognition . &quot;
And she described the father of this tool as an &quot; admi@@ rable ide@@ alist of the universal cause of the fight against poverty , &quot; whose work is known for 15 years , when the Queen went to Banglades@@ h to find out in the field the policy of loans .
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in I@@ vor@@ y Coast in 1999 , Canada 2006 , and &quot; in all I have seen the continued evolution , &quot; said His Maj@@ est@@ y , whose link with this project made her earn yesterday the title of the &quot; head of the family &quot; in Vall@@ ado@@ li@@ d from the &quot; ban@@ ker of the poor . &quot;
Finally , the Queen Mr@@ s. Sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty .
&quot; Eth@@ ical imperative &quot;
Foreign Minister , Tr@@ ini@@ dad Jim@@ é@@ nez , said that solidarity &quot; is an ethical imperative &quot; to every democratic state .
In this regard , she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom , as it is a &quot; continuing obligation . &quot;
Jim@@ en@@ ez found that micro@@ credit sup@@ poses &quot; a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradic@@ ating poverty , &quot; and now &quot; more than ever , &quot; the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let this fall as victim of adjustments .
For Spain , micro@@ credit is &quot; one of the main lines of development cooperation . &quot;
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation , Sor@@ aya Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , pra@@ ised the &quot; success &quot; to give &quot; trust &quot; to people &quot; excluded to whom all doors are closed , &quot; and the may@@ or of Vall@@ ado@@ li@@ d , Francisco J@@ avier Le@@ on de la Ri@@ va , welcomed those present to a city that &quot; opens its doors caught by the spirit of solidarity . &quot;
CD@@ U intends to elect the European President by universal suff@@ rage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union ( CD@@ U ) on Monday 14 November , in Leipzig took place without any real problems arising for the Chancellor Angela Merkel , who is also President of the Christian Democratic party .
The future of Europe was not initially planned to be on the programme , but imposed itself in the autumn , in particular to satisfy the milit@@ ants who will be watching the government &apos;s policy on Greece today and perhaps that on Italy tomorrow ....
The motion on the pre@@ iden@@ cy of the European Commission , tabled by the direc@@ torate , was adopted almost unanimously .
Out of 10@@ 01 deleg@@ ates , only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting .
The standing ov@@ ation lasting several minutes which they , Angela Merkel and then a few hours later , Wolfgang Schä@@ ub@@ le , the very Europ@@ hi@@ le Minister of Finance , received at the end of their respective speeches , left no room for doubt .
The main idea of the Chancellor and of the motion , is embo@@ died in the s@@ logan &quot; the right response to the crisis is not less Europe , but more Europe . &quot;
Not only because Europe means peace , but because &quot; nine million jobs depend directly on the Euro . &quot;
For the Chancellor , &quot; the time has arrived for a breakthrough in Europe . &quot;
This could mean modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon , making it possible to strengthen the control by the European Union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the Eurozone , but this could also affect the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suff@@ rage &quot; in order to im@@ part a face to Europe . &quot;
This is , generally speaking , the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Schä@@ ub@@ le .
Certainly , it is not prob@@ able that the T@@ w@@ enty-@@ Seven will rapidly agree to this solution ; Great Britain is opposed to it and the heads of CD@@ U think that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it .
But the mark@@ er is in place .
Similarly , the deleg@@ ates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each countr@@ y-@@ Member of the direc@@ torate of the European Central Bank according the size of its economy , which would clearly increase the weight of the German economy .
An@@ xi@@ ous to calm the climate in her party , the Chancellor increased the number of her references to Kon@@ rad A@@ den@@ auer and to Hel@@ mut Koh@@ l , but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the &quot; small &quot; European countries , or of countries in difficulty , which are quick to critic@@ ise &quot; arrogan@@ t &quot; Germany .
Although the motion on Europe de@@ votes a paragraph to the importance of &quot; Fran@@ co-@@ German friendship , &quot; Angela Merkel did not mention France .
Exc@@ ept when in a hole .
Rec@@ alling that two centuries ago , Leipzig was the scene of a bloo@@ dy battle .
In fact , it was one of the most hum@@ ili@@ ating defe@@ ats of the Napole@@ onic army .
What is sick leave fraud ?
After allow@@ ances , the UM@@ P and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave .
On 15 November , Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bor@@ deaux to visit a family allow@@ ances allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject , which has been recur@@ ring since 2007 , concerning the fight against social assistance fraud .
And to help this offensive stem@@ ming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints , but which also forms part of the presidential re-@@ election campaign , the majority want to concentrate on sick leave .
First and foremost , with a view to budgetary economies , the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of unemployment benefit
Clearly , without the specific consent of the emplo@@ yer , an employee falling sick will lose four days &apos; pay equal to at least 15 % of his / her monthly income .
A measure , which threatens to ar@@ ouse anger , but which , according to Les Ech@@ os , would produce a saving of 280 million Euros .
And which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect , namely , the im@@ position on public employees of one day &apos;s wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave ( public employees have not hi@@ therto had to wait for the payment of benefit , as against a three days &apos; wait by private employees ) .
Now that these questions are being discussed , the majority are also rela@@ un@@ ching the subject of fraud , targe@@ ting abuses linked to medical certificates .
&quot; The controls will become more rigid and in addition , if you are caught , you will have to re@@ pay any non-@@ legitimate benefit received , &quot; warned X@@ avier Ber@@ tr@@ and on RT@@ L on Sunday 13 November .
As in other cases , the effects of the announcement appear a little dis@@ proportionate to the reality of medical certific@@ ate-@@ related fraud .
This has actually been monitored constantly since 2002 via political offen@@ si@@ ves , which have usually borne fruit .
The French are no si@@ cker than people elsewhere in Europe .
Let us first of all look at the national figures .
According to the Ca@@ isse nationale d &apos;@@ assurance mal@@ a@@ die ( CN@@ AM ) , over 23@@ 7 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006 .
According to l &apos;@@ Institut de Recher@@ che et de Docum@@ entation en Econom@@ ie de la Sant@@ é , the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 at 1@@ 1,@@ 3 thousand million Euros , was 5 % of total health expenditure .
Of this sum , 46 % concerned mat@@ ernity leave and accidents at work and 54 % sick leave benefit at 6,@@ 2 thousand million Euros .
And therefore represented 2,5 % of heal@@ th-@@ related expenditure .
The French spent an average of 14@@ ,5 days on sick leave in 2010 , compared with 17.@@ 8 days in 2009 , according to a study by Al@@ ma Consulting Group .
An average , which conce@@ als certain diver@@ gen@@ ces ; another inquiry published in 2007 by the Mon@@ ster@@ .com career management site , showed that 75 % of the 40 000 French employees ques@@ tioned said that they had not taken any days of sick leave .
Another study , this time concerning si@@ ckness insur@@ ances , states that in 2010 , 37 % of sick leave la@@ sted less than 8 days , 15 % 15 days to one month , 15 % from one to three months and 11 % la@@ sted longer .
Com@@ par@@ ing these figures with those of their European neighbours , French employees are no more inc@@ lined to take sick leave than those in any other country .
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CN@@ RS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 , the global rate of absence from work in France ( for reasons of health or not ) fluctu@@ ated between 10 % and 11 % , compared with between 20 % and 28 % in Denmark , 15 % in the United Kingdom , or between 16 % and 18 % in The Netherlands .
Si@@ ckness certific@@ ate-@@ related fraud is very low , compared with &quot; black &quot; labour .
As regards fraud , it is very low .
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 45 days .
In 2008 , out of 1,5 million controls , the CN@@ AM found that 13 % of the 28@@ 5 000 controls on short-term si@@ ckness certificates were &quot; un@@ justified , &quot; or too long , &quot; equal to 37 0@@ 50 cases .
In the case of systematically controlled certificates valid for more than 45 days , 11 % cases were found to be &quot; inappropriate or un@@ justified &quot; out of 1,@@ 2 million , equal to 13@@ 2 000 .
In total therefore , 16@@ 9 000 cases were &quot; un@@ justified , &quot; out of several million of employees issued with certificates .
A figure which represents very few cases , compared , for example , with the &quot; black &quot; labour figure .
According to the UM@@ P dep@@ uty Domini@@ que Ti@@ an , author of a report on the subject in June , this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million Euros annual tax short@@ fall , equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infin@@ itely higher than losses due to fraud .
Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s : Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy .
This was declared on Monday 14 November by the Prime Minister Lu@@ cas Pap@@ ad@@ é@@ mos in parliament , adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not long enough for the accompli@@ sh@@ ment of this task .
&quot; To pursue the efforts of rescu@@ ing the economy , we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment &quot; declared the head of government , who made his first public speech opening the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday .
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the Eurozone on 27 October shall be the &quot; principal task &quot; of the new government , because participation of the country in the Eurozone &quot; is at stake , &quot; he added .
Consequently , M. Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s forecast that the country &apos;s public deficit would be reduced to &quot; about 9 % &quot; of the P@@ I@@ B by the end of the year , after having been 10.@@ 6 % in 2010 and 15.@@ 7 % in 2009 .
The Right re@@ jects new austerity measures
On Monday , Ant@@ on@@ is Sam@@ ar@@ as , the leader of the Right , gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis , but warned that his party would not support additional austerity .
&quot; We will not vote in favour of new measures , &quot; he said at a meeting with the de@@ pu@@ ties of his New Democracy party .
He declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste , but also his opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery .
To O@@ ll@@ i Rehn , the European commission@@ er responsible for economic and monetary affairs , who warned that the F@@ M@@ I and the EU would not un@@ block the loan of 8 thousand million Euros required , without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the planned measures , Antonio Sam@@ ar@@ as rep@@ lied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure .
It is necessary to leg@@ alise eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suicide , says a committee of experts
Canadi@@ ans are living half dead , according to a report of the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding pal@@ li@@ ative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible pal@@ li@@ ative care , apart from cancer cases .
Canadian society is half dead .
Only 9 % of Canadi@@ ans agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .
This is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada , in which six experts in different fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code , so as to permit assisted suicide and eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision .
At the outset , the experts c@@ ite a recent inquiry by the Econom@@ ist Intel@@ ligence Unit , which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide .
Whilst Canada is placed 10th , the study notes that &quot; the medic@@ alisation of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death .
Medi@@ c@@ alisation or not , 77 % of Canadi@@ ans do not have access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada .
And 86 % of them end by dying in hospital
Coun@@ tr@@ y@@ wide , it is in Que@@ bec that the rate is highest , with 86 % of deaths taking place in hospital .
On the delicate question of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the Federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suicide .
Now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been leg@@ alised or de@@ crimin@@ alised , there is no proof that the aid de@@ crimin@@ alisation involves abuses of application , that is to say , the practice of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not con@@ sent@@ ing .
On the contrary , affir@@ med during a tel@@ ec@@ on@@ ference , Jo@@ cel@@ yn Down@@ ie , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suicide have not been leg@@ alised .
&quot; Eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia is practi@@ sed in Canada , where it is clearly illegal . &quot;
&quot; Assi@@ sted suicide is practi@@ sed in Canada , where it is clearly illegal , explains Jo@@ cel@@ yn Down@@ ie .
Canadi@@ ans in favour of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia
It should be remembered that 85 % of Canadi@@ ans are in favour of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia , because according to an An@@ gu@@ s Rei@@ d en@@ quiry in 2010 , they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to allevi@@ ate their suffering .
And the leg@@ alisation of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handic@@ apped persons had less value .
Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosec@@ uted .
Regarding the continuation , or the withdrawal of nur@@ sing care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .
They also suggest among their other recommendations , that the pen@@ al code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nur@@ sing care is not criminal .
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nur@@ sing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosec@@ ution .
Regarding pal@@ li@@ ative care , the committee calls on governments , nur@@ sing institutions , and doctors to work together to provide the best possible pal@@ li@@ ative care and not only in cases of cancer .
Lastly , concerning pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ dation already widely used in Canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and that it should be subject to the same procedures .
Reserv@@ ations of other experts
Cer@@ tain experts in the field of the heal@@ th-@@ related legislation have already voic@@ ed reservations concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts &apos; report .
Ma@@ î@@ tre Pierre Des@@ champ@@ s , a specialist in health legislation , described as &quot; extreme &quot; the position of the experts who signed the report , because among other things , it does not restrict the practice of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia to terminal cases .
&quot; This opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old , could ask for help to commit suicide , says Me Des@@ champ@@ s , who yesterday consulted a summary of the report .
Me Des@@ champ@@ s also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
He says that &quot; in society there are sign@@ posts and constraints .
The specialist in health legislation , Mar@@ gare@@ t Som@@ er@@ ville also expressed &quot; strong opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as being &quot; obviously pro-@@ eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia . &quot;
Mar@@ gare@@ t Som@@ er@@ ville , who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada , con@@ tests , in particular , the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assisted suicide have been leg@@ alised as in The Netherlands and in O@@ reg@@ on .
The King of Jordan calls on president As@@ sad to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish power
Dam@@ as@@ cus den@@ oun@@ ces a &quot; plot &quot;
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The parti@@ sans of Bach@@ ar al-@@ As@@ sad demonstrated yesterday in front of the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Diplom@@ atic pressures intensi@@ fied yesterday on the Syria of Bach@@ ar al-@@ As@@ sad , who , with the support of Russia , is resi@@ sting them and has den@@ ounced a &quot; plot &quot; against his country .
Two days after the suspension of Syria from membership of the Arab League , the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Dam@@ as@@ cus , whilst Syria &apos;s neighbours Turkey and Jordan , came out in favour of president As@@ sad &apos;s departure .
King Ab@@ dal@@ lah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on president Bach@@ ar al-@@ As@@ sad to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish power in Syria , where some for@@ ty civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed .
&quot; If Bach@@ ar had the interest of his country at heart , he would have to re@@ sign , but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of the political life , said the King of Jordan , a neighbouring country of Syria , in a BBC interview .
In his turn , the Turkish foreign minister , Ah@@ met Dav@@ ut@@ o@@ gl@@ u deplo@@ red the fact that Turkish efforts to medi@@ ate , which began at the start of the year , did not meet with success .
&quot; Those in the Middle East who are at peace with their people , but cannot satisfy their aspirations , will leave power , he said , all@@ u@@ ding to Syria , a neighbouring country , on which Turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line .
For their part , the United States are congratulating themselves on the increased consensus against As@@ sad and the actions of the Syri@@ an regime following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union .
&quot; The international community , the United States , the European Union , the Arab Leg@@ au@@ e , and countries such as Turkey , are adopting an increasingly harder line &quot; in the face of the the repression in Syria , observed Mark Ton@@ er , a spo@@ kes@@ man of the State Department .
During this time , 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime die in the area of Der@@ a@@ a in the south of Syria , announced l &apos;@@ Ob@@ serv@@ ato@@ ire sy@@ ri@@ en des dro@@ its de l &apos;@@ h@@ omm@@ e ( OS@@ D@@ H ) .
Two other civilians died during exchanges of fire and heavy ri@@ f@@ les at J@@ ob@@ ar in the be@@ si@@ eg@@ ed town of H@@ oms , according tot his ON@@ G .
During a Press conference , the Syri@@ an foreign minister W@@ ali@@ d Mou@@ allem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis . &quot;
He moreover re@@ acted strongly against the decision of the Arab League to suspend Dam@@ as@@ cus which according to him represents a &quot; dangerous step . &quot;
Syria will not bend , he added , ass@@ uring that p@@ lots against Syria would fail . &quot;
After its decision to suspend Syria , the Arab League is at present studying &quot; a protection mechanism for civilians and wants the dispat@@ ch of 500 members of of Arab rights of man organisations , of media and of military observers into the country .
The French foreign minister Ala@@ in Ju@@ pp@@ é also declared himself in favour to the dispat@@ ch of UNO observers to help to protect civilians from repression by the regime , which according to him , is &quot; par@@ ano@@ id . &quot;
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow to debate the implementation of escape from the crisis decided on 2 November and fore@@ seeing in particular , the withdrawal of armed forces from the towns in dispute and the liber@@ ation of arrested demonstr@@ ators .
The Russian foreign minister , S@@ erg@@ y@@ ey Lav@@ ro@@ v , yesterday described as &quot; incorrect &quot; the decision of the Arab League , whilst China ex@@ hor@@ ted Syria to implement the plan of emerging from the crisis , taking care not to support possible sanctions against Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacri@@ fi@@ ces from Itali@@ ans
The future head of the Italian government , Mario Monti , has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and to implement a programme , which will involve &quot; sacri@@ fi@@ ces , &quot; in order to recover credibility lost over the last few months of the Berlusconi government .
The former European commission@@ er was yesterday in discussions with the political parties before today &apos;s meeting with unions and employers
He will have to form a relatively moderate cab@@ inet composed of te@@ chno@@ crats from outside parliament .
&quot; Monti spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacri@@ fi@@ ces , &quot; said Franc@@ esco Nu@@ car@@ a , a dep@@ uty of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minist@@ er-@@ design@@ ate .
The president of the Chamber or de@@ pu@@ ties , Gi@@ an@@ fran@@ co Fin@@ i , said that he would wait to learn if Mario Monti would ask parliament for a vote of confidence between now and Friday , to as@@ certain whether the new government had enough support .
The consultations will end in the presentation by M. Monti of a limited list of a do@@ zen or so ministers to the head of State , Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ poli@@ tano .
M. Monti comm@@ ented on the ner@@ v@@ ousness of the stock@@ markets here , asking them for time .
In a &quot; democracy , time is needed for the preparation of a government and a programme , he stressed , adding that he was certain that the markets would be patient and understanding . &quot;
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets , but dis@@ quiet re-@@ emerged , in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in Eurozone in September .
The prime minist@@ er-@@ design@@ ate had to form a team , most importantly comprising te@@ chno@@ crats , even though he stressed that he would also like to include &quot; politicians . &quot;
The new government would have to last until 2013 , the date of the next election , he said .
According to the president of the Chamber of de@@ pu@@ ties , Gi@@ an@@ fran@@ co Fin@@ i , the new government would secure the vote of confidence of parliament by Friday .
M. Monti under@@ took that once in office he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become a pro@@ tagon@@ ist in Europe .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the European Commissioner , O@@ ll@@ i Reh@@ n@@ . stressed that &quot; regardless of a new government , our diagno@@ stic of the Italian economy has not changed . &quot;
The European Union , being convinced that Rome would not achieve its objective budget in 2013 despite the austerity plan adopted over recent months , has asked , in particular , for stringent new measures .
The Italian &quot; bo@@ ss of bo@@ sses &quot; E@@ mma Mar@@ c@@ eg@@ ag@@ lia , who will meet him on Tuesday , has also insi@@ sted on the necessity of rela@@ un@@ ching the economy , &quot; because a country which does not have growth , cannot observe the parameters of deficit . &quot;
M. Monti , known for his competence and for his independence when he was European Commissioner ( 199@@ 4-@@ 2004 ) , represents a &quot; change of e@@ po@@ ch &quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot; ber@@ lus@@ con@@ ism , &quot; the &quot; professor &quot; symboli@@ sing &quot; the challenge of seri@@ ousness &quot; and &quot; another Italy , &quot; according to the lea@@ der@@ writers .
The great unknown is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of his team .
President Na@@ poli@@ tano would like to avoid an early election , because by April 2012 Italy must place State deb@@ ent@@ ures worth 200 thousand million Euros .
A Russian scienti@@ st has assisted an Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scienti@@ st , V@@ y@@ ch@@ es@@ la@@ v Dan@@ il@@ en@@ ko , assisted Iran to develop a de@@ ton@@ ator usable with a nuclear weapon , confirmed on Monday an American agency speciali@@ sing in the field of atom@@ ic haz@@ ard .
The Institute of Science of International Safety IS@@ IS ) bases itself on the recent report from the International Atom@@ ic Safety Agency ( A@@ I@@ EA ) and other documents from this UNO agency , to identify this resear@@ cher .
Last week , A@@ I@@ EA announced its serious dis@@ quiet concerning a &quot; possible military dimension &quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme .
According to IS@@ IS drawing largely on A@@ I@@ EA documents , M. Dan@@ il@@ en@@ ko , born in 19@@ 34 , worked for 30 years from the &apos; six@@ ties on@@ ward , in a Soviet military nuclear centre in T@@ ch@@ eli@@ ab@@ ins@@ k ( U@@ ral ) , and was involved in the manufacture by explosion of synthetic diam@@ onds .
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to establish a company producing &quot; n@@ an@@ o-@@ diam@@ ants &quot; in Kie@@ v .
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian emb@@ assy in Ukraine in 1995 .
He then co@@ operated on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 , before returning to Russia .
In its last report , A@@ I@@ EA men@@ tions &quot; strong indications that the development by Iran &quot; of a system of nuclear de@@ ton@@ ation &quot; was ai@@ ded by the work of a foreign expert , who not only knew this technique well , but who also informed the Agency that he had worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin . &quot;
Anti-@@ Mo@@ sle@@ m crimes have increased by 50 %
Between 2009 and 2010 , anti-@@ Mo@@ sle@@ m crimes increase by almost 50 % , whilst during the same period other forms of ra@@ cial and religious violence had fallen slightly , or had not changed , according to F@@ B@@ I statistics published on Monday .
According to these figures , the total number of cases of violence against Mo@@ sle@@ ms moved from 10@@ 7 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 , equal to an increase of 49 % , as against an increase of 13 % of cases of violence against Catho@@ lic@@ s , a fall of 4 % of attacks on Jews and a global increase of 14 % in anti-@@ religious crimes .
The global number of h@@ ate crimes increased very slightly to 6 6@@ 28 cases , of which 4@@ 7,@@ 3 % were motivated by ra@@ cial differences and 20 % by religious differences , according to F@@ B@@ I .
&quot; After a decrease in 2009 , it is distur@@ bing to see these crimes increasing again , stressed the rights of man organisation , Human Rights First , &quot; the increase of cases of anti-@@ Mo@@ sle@@ m violence is particularly significant , &quot; added the organisation in a comm@@ uniqu@@ é .
&quot; Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Mo@@ sle@@ ms , as well as all forms of h@@ ate crime , must be regarded as serious violations of human rights , &quot; adds one of the managers of the organisation , Paul Le@@ gen@@ dr@@ e .
&quot; The American government can and must do more to deal with his abuse , he adds , jud@@ ging that this could be due to the editing of police reports on h@@ ate crimes . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ate crime &quot; in Federal law , is a legacy from the period of struggle for civil rights .
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Lu@@ ther King to pun@@ ish acts of violence linked to race , colour of skin , religion , origin and now sexual orientation .
Twitter modi@@ fies its platform and res@@ embles Facebook
On Monday , the micro@@ blog site Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform , to allow its users , in particular , to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring , which makes its service res@@ emble that of Facebook .
A new tab &quot; activity &quot; and another &quot; name &quot; make it possible to follow more legi@@ bly and directly the activity of other &quot; Twi@@ t@@ ters , &quot; the internet navig@@ ators whose messages are monitored ( &quot; t@@ we@@ ets &quot; ) and of those who monitor you .
This enables one to know if they cause messages to be monitored , if they subscribe new accounts , if they have favourite messages , etc .
This new Twitter formula was tested &quot; on a small percentage of users in August &quot; before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday , indicated a spo@@ kes@@ woman of Twitter , Carol@@ yn P@@ enn@@ er to AF@@ P .
Twitter , which has been known so far for being rather un@@ intuitive , and for its use of somewhat es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic terms ( R@@ T for re-@@ posting someone else &apos;s message , # fol@@ low@@ fri@@ day for recomm@@ ending following other users ) , much to the delight of experienced users , is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks Facebook and Google + .
On the network , users debated this innovation via &quot; t@@ we@@ ets &quot; on internet .
&quot; It is us@@ eless , inv@@ a@@ sive and res@@ embles Facebook exc@@ essively &quot;

Austria
In@@ scri@@ ption of a budgetary &quot; golden rule &quot; in the constitution
The government of the great social democratic / Christian democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary &quot; golden rule &quot; into the constitution , in order to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible down@@ gra@@ ding by rating agencies of Austria &apos;s sovereign credit r@@ sting ( triple A ) .
It was the soci@@ al-@@ democratic Chancellor his elf , Werner Fa@@ y@@ mann , who announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the council of ministers , with the Austrian public debt at 7@@ 4,@@ 6 % , much higher than the nor@@ m of a maximum of 60 % set by the treaty of Maastricht , but below the public debt of countries like Italy , Greece or Spain .
&quot; If the solven@@ cy of Austria had not fallen by a single not@@ ch , from A@@ AA to AA + , we would have to pay three thousand million Euros of interest more every year , &quot; argued the vic@@ e-@@ chan@@ cell@@ or and Christian democratic foreign minister , Michael Sp@@ in@@ deleg@@ ger .
Austria thus comp@@ lies with a request from the Brussels summit of member@@ -@@ States of Eurozone on 26 October ; the heads of State and government requested a reduction by the end of 2@@ 10@@ 2 of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to the same effect .
The dis@@ positions adopted by the Austrian government approach the &quot; German model , &quot; being the first European country to adopt this &quot; rule . &quot;
By 20@@ 17 , the public structural deficit must fall by 0.@@ 75 % of the P@@ I@@ B ) and from 20@@ 17 , the structural public deficit of the Austrian Federal State must not exceed 0,@@ 35 % of P@@ I@@ B in any year , whilst the Länder , as well as communities , must submit balanced budgets .
The objective is that of making public debt fall below the 60 % criterion fixed by the treaty of Maastricht by 2020 / 20@@ 21 .
Yo@@ shi@@ ho@@ ko No@@ da
threatens fresh intervention on the exchange market
The Japanese prime minister , Yo@@ shi@@ hi@@ ko No@@ da , warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchanges market if the value of the yen continued to rise .
&quot; We would intervene as we did the last time , if we found excessive vol@@ atility in the rate of exchange of the yen , explained M. No@@ da to the Sen@@ ate .
On Tuesday , the yen rose to near historical levels , causing the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October .
On that date , Tokyo sold the yen against the dollar on a massive scale in order to cut the value of the Japanese currency , which was setting a new record of strength since 1945 .
But the yen had risen regularly since then , stimul@@ ated by purchases by investors who regard it as a &quot; shel@@ ter &quot; in these uncertain times of worldwide economic slow@@ down and the debt crisis in Europe .
On Tuesday , the dollar fell below 77 yen and the Euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen , close to levels which trig@@ gered the last intervention .
Pri@@ or to the financial crisis of 2008-@@ 2009 , the dollar was about 120 yen and the Euro over 160 yen .
This rise of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports , because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of Japanese firms from abroad , when converted into the national currency .
&quot; Japan is fighting to re@@ construct itself &quot; since the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami on 11 March , which dev@@ ast@@ ated the region of To@@ ho@@ ku ( north-@@ east ) , stressed M. No@@ da who fears that this rise of the yen does not kill the fragile embry@@ onic recovery .
The world &apos;s third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter -@@ 1,5 % compared with the previous quarter - for the first time for a year , thanks to a rise in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrop@@ he .
But the prime minister felt that the high price of the yen did to reflect &quot; Japan &apos;s economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
The minister of finance , J@@ un A@@ zu@@ mi , called on the Bank of Japan ( Bo@@ J ) , which on Tuesday opened a two-@@ day meeting of its monetary policy council , to take every necessary step to weaken the yen .
But the dep@@ uty govern@@ or of the institution , Hi@@ ro@@ hide Yam@@ agu@@ chi , warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken steps the &quot; appropriate steps &quot; stating that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on Wednesday
Since its last meeting at the end of October , the issuing institution increased by 5.000 million yen ( 47 thousand million Euro &apos;s ) worth of treas@@ ury bond purchases , raising the ceiling to 5@@ 5.000 thousand million yen ( 5@@ 19 thousand million Euros ) , which it is de@@ voting to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market .
Eurozone :
the rates are climbing , the stock exchanges are wa@@ ver@@ ing
The risk of con@@ ta@@ gion of the debt crisis is undermining European indi@@ ces .
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and in Italy and better growth figures in France and in Germany , the rates in fragile countries continue to rise .
Still worried about the stability of Eurozone , European exchanges have entered a little further into the negative area on this Tuesday 15 November .
In Paris , at 10 a.m. , the CA@@ C 40 lost 1,@@ 4 % to end at 3.@@ 0@@ 64 points .
The Da@@ x at Frankfurt fell 0,@@ 4 % and London 0,@@ 1 % .
&quot; With the new tensions about the yield of loans of Eurozone States in difficulties , the share markets worldwide con@@ tim@@ ue to lose a part of their recent gains . &quot;
&quot; Ner@@ vous investors are only too aware of the risk of con@@ ta@@ gion , &quot; explains Ter@@ ry P@@ rat@@ t , an institutional bro@@ ker at I@@ G Mark@@ ets quoted by Re@@ uter .
The Tokyo exchange closed with a fall of 0,@@ 7 % , suffering fresh doubts of market participants on the subject of the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis .
&quot; Japan , like the rest of the world has its eyes ri@@ v@@ eted on Europe and the exchanges will ch@@ ase one another in a corri@@ dor of narrow variations as investors will not have proof that the situation has stabili@@ sed , &quot; states Mit@@ sus@@ hi@@ ge Ak@@ ino , fund manager at I@@ chi@@ yo@@ sh@@ i Investment Management .
This re-@@ emergence of dis@@ quiet about the future of Eurozone pen@@ ali@@ ses the single currency , which has continued to fall on Tuesday .
The Euro is reaching its lowest level for a month and a half .
To@@ wards 10 a.m. the European currency is worth 1,@@ 35@@ 70 dollars , having fallen by 0,@@ 4 % .
According to bro@@ kers , it fell after the party of the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel , the CD@@ U meeting on Monday adopted a motion , envis@@ aging , in particular , the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the Eurozone without also leaving the European Union .
Italian and Spanish rates substantially above 6 %
The borro@@ wing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very dis@@ qui@@ eting levels .
This Tuesday morning the yield of Italian 10-@@ year deb@@ ent@@ ures at@@ tained 6,@@ 85 % , that of Spanish ones of the same mat@@ urity date , 6,@@ 2 % .
These tensions of the rates of interest of southern countries , but also France , continue to feed the ap@@ prehen@@ sions of participants .
The head of the future Italian government , Mario Monti asked the markets for time to restore the situation in an Italy threatened by as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia by the weight of its debt .
The new Greek prime minister Lu@@ cas Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s affir@@ med that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be &quot; the principal task &quot; of his government .
Spain finds itself in the line of fire by the markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on Sunday .
The spread of the rate between 10-@@ year German and Spanish bonds has reached a new histor@@ ically high level .
A@@ waiting the growth figures of Eurozone
France has recorded an economic growth of 0,@@ 4 % in the third quarter , a little better than the expected 0,@@ 3 % , due to increased household consumption .
The In@@ seen nevertheless revised down@@ wards the figure for the second quarter , with a fall of 0,@@ 1 % of the gross internal product ( P@@ I@@ B ) instead of stag@@ nation .
And it is really the fourth quarter , which most dis@@ qui@@ ets the economists .
Germany for its part , ha recorded a growth of 0,@@ 5 % for the same period .
A first estimate in respect of the whole Eurozone is expected at 11 a.m , the European Commission having warned against the risk of a new recession .
Energy policy :
F@@ acts must prevail over do@@ g@@ mas
If there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short-term considerations , or under the stress of emo@@ tion , it is energy policy .
The availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .
It is healthy that an electoral ren@@ de@@ z@@ vous should be an occasion for reflecting on such st@@ akes and the place occupied by nuclear power .
The debate will not be fruit@@ ful , unless it explo@@ res all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
The French must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .
Now that we are 7 thousand million human beings on the planet , demographic development will involve a doub@@ ling of demand for electricity by 2050 , unless a huge proportion of the world &apos;s population is deprived of a vital element .
During the same period , it will become necessary to pal@@ li@@ ate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without for@@ getting the over@@ riding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight clim@@ atic im@@ balance , a subject which has van@@ ished from the ecological debate .
The Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accident does not modify any of these parameters .
This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to ren@@ ounce nuclear energy .
This is not the case of Belgium , which sub@@ ordin@@ ates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of Switzerland , which intends to build only the most modern ones .
On the other hand , Great Britain , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India , Brazil to quote only a few , pursue their projects with determination .
The United States , decided after Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma to add a unit to their range by resu@@ ming the construction of a centre , which was interrupted after the Three Mi@@ le Island accident .
Although the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradi@@ cts that argument .
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an increased energy dependence ag@@ grav@@ ated by increased rec@@ ourse to imported gas , in particular from Russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .
In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt .
The case of Denmark should be considered .
Champion of Europe in the construction of tur@@ bin@@ es , from which it draws 30 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to inter@@ mitt@@ ent wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and 50 % higher than the European average .
On the other hand , thanks to the con@@ stan@@ cy of energy policy , our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than French households .
Since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory , French companies benefit from the che@@ ap@@ est electricity in Europe .
Due to this , any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render ill@@ us@@ ory the fine declarations on re-@@ industri@@ alisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .
A price , which a large majority of the French refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .
It should be rec@@ alled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 4@@ 10 000 resulting ones .
St@@ ron@@ g@@ ly ex@@ port-@@ oriented , it attrac@@ ts a galax@@ y of specialised R@@ ME &apos;s in international markets and creates many jobs , which cannot be moved elsewhere .
If France decided to abandon nuclear power , she would sacrifice a large number of these R@@ ME &apos;s and lose the annual 6 thousand million Euro &apos;s worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services .
What electri@@ cian would recommend a EP@@ R designed to function for six@@ ty years , if the decline of its manufacture was program@@ med ?
To solve the energy equ@@ ation , it must be admitted that there is no mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous or di@@ abo@@ lical source of production of electricity .
The development by Are@@ va of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy .
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety , is absolutely vital .
In France , we have a safety authority , which exercises an in@@ transi@@ gent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Fl@@ aman@@ ville .
Our teams , whose professionalism is recognised , are accu@@ stom@@ ed to the same saf@@ et@@ y-@@ related ob@@ session .
In a space of 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .
Only one , Three Mi@@ le Island , occurred under normal operating conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .
At T@@ cher@@ nobyl , the design of the re@@ actor and unfor@@ gi@@ vable human error brought about the drama .
At Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magn@@ it@@ ude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people .
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as it has from its two predec@@ essors .
The fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and French and German construc@@ tors , the EP@@ R presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .
Since it is being considered by all electri@@ cians wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at Fl@@ aman@@ ville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Are@@ va and ED@@ F by cle@@ aring their way to sei@@ zing the leadership of the un@@ avoid@@ able development of nuclear energy .
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emo@@ tion , do@@ g@@ mas and parti@@ san manoeu@@ v@@ res to domin@@ ate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy ?
Imm@@ igration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a con@@ gestion of police , legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self-@@ proc@@ laimed status of the country as the country of French human rights .
More recently , it is administrative har@@ ass@@ ment of foreign students , which is topical , with the minister of the interior ( &quot; Lib@@ é@@ ration &quot; on 23 May ) declar@@ ing that France &quot; does not need foreign talent , bri@@ ck@@ layers and wa@@ it@@ ers . &quot;
But it is only rarely analy@@ sed from the economic view@@ point .
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject .
On the Right , the tone was set by Jacques Chirac , who declared in 1976 that &quot; 9@@ 00@@ ,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers , &quot; and on the Left by Michel Ro@@ card expla@@ ining in 1990 that France &quot; cannot accommodate all the world &apos;s mis@@ ery . &quot;
The only difference , the degree of gener@@ osity
In 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hor@@ des of Polish pl@@ um@@ bers was felt both on the Left and on the Right .
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society .
The only difference re@@ sides in the degree of gener@@ osity , which one d@@ eign@@ s to grant to immigrants .
In his programme , Franç@@ ois Hol@@ lan@@ de con@@ fines himself to ban@@ alities , saying that co-@@ development would allow our immigration problem to be solved . &quot;
This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .
As the economists I@@ an Gol@@ din and Ge@@ off@@ rey Cam@@ eron , remind us in a recent book sum@@ mar@@ ising the most recent knowledge of immigration ( Ex@@ cep@@ tional People : How Migration Sha@@ ped Our World and Will De@@ fine Our Future , ma@@ i 2011 , Princ@@ et@@ on University Press , 3@@ 52 pp . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .
Re@@ stra@@ ining immigration leads to an@@ a@@ em@@ ic growth and har@@ ms employment .
F@@ ears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers , in particular un@@ skilled ones , exer@@ ting down@@ ward pressure on wages .
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to , rather than replac@@ ements of , local labour , exerc@@ ising tra@@ des in which there is a shortage of local labour .
Un@@ skilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a sur@@ ge@@ on would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ sts , the comple@@ ment@@ arities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals .
Giovanni Per@@ i has calculated that a rise of 1 % in the mig@@ r@@ atory flow causes an increase of between 0,@@ 6 and 0,@@ 9 % in real long-term pay .
And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a large proportion of nat@@ u@@ rali@@ sed immigrants are among American Nobel pri@@ ze@@ winners , whilst Google , Intel , Pa@@ yp@@ al , eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants ) .
M@@ igrants are also net contribut@@ ors to social systems , aver@@ aging 1 % of the total budgets of European countries .
T@@ h World Labour Organisation estimates that for example in Germany , an imm@@ igrant arriving at the age of 30 , will make a net contribution ( recei@@ p@@ ts less expenditure ) of an average of 150@@ ,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime .
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth &quot; with the teeth . &quot;
The teeth in question , intended to serve to dis@@ su@@ ade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .
Europe invented democracy , thinks in terms of European democracy
Democracy is a precious possession ; it is also a fragile one .
The European continent should be able to remember that having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the XX@@ th century the trage@@ dies of the World War , of tot@@ ali@@ tar@@ isms , the Holocau@@ st , the gul@@ ag , but also Fran@@ co in Spain , Sal@@ az@@ ar in Portugal and the colon@@ els in Greece .
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally tri@@ umph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .
It is known that since the time of Napole@@ on it was a matter of fac@@ ul@@ ty of thinking .
Universal suff@@ rage , in order to be the s@@ ine qu@@ a non of democracy , is not enough and can actually become a &quot; tool of op@@ pression &quot; as once said the republi@@ can philos@@ op@@ her E@@ ti@@ enne V@@ ach@@ er@@ ot .
No , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the Lum@@ ier@@ es , economic and social solidarity , justice .
The European crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
In this respect , the pal@@ in@@ ode of a tru@@ e-@@ false Greek referendum will have a double re@@ vel@@ atory value , that of a need of a powerful re@@ versal of policy , but also that of the worrying sen@@ timent of its im@@ possibility and of its in@@ con@@ gru@@ ity .
This ambi@@ val@@ ence must be thought through , in order that it can be b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed .
The truth is that the lines of the fore@@ front of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the republi@@ can soldiers are no longer fir@@ ing in the right direction .
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succ@@ ession of national refer@@ endums organised as required and in a confused sequence .
The &quot; free hand &quot; of an absolute European mon@@ arch , or a jump with tied feet into the nation@@ alist void ; what a choice for a citizen !
No , we do not want the bla@@ des of a guil@@ lot@@ ine , but an exercise , joint , ser@@ ene and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on European level .
There are no crises in Greece , Italy , Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop en@@ um@@ er@@ ating them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe .
It is the whole of Europe , which def@@ ers to the dict@@ ates of the markets and of rating agencies , who suffer from their incap@@ acity and a lack of solidarity .
It is all Europe , which is hum@@ ili@@ ated on the international scene .
There is dis@@ quiet about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but it is the entire Europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and with its each of its nations .
The urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty , the direction of the European project .
Because it is by all working together , that Europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts , to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it .
Emer@@ ging from the crisis will ent@@ ail decisions on European level , which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster .
After having long fought this proposal by specialists and of Jacques Del@@ ors , the whole world now calls for a European economic government .
Let is be so .
But the idea without stronger economic , political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens , would be a fresh fol@@ ly and a new im@@ pas@@ se .
We must launch a new stage of European construction .
To establish the Republic in France , it was necessary to &quot; make &quot; re@@ public@@ ans .
The Revolution of interests would not be enough .
This lesson remains valid .
We must construct a Europe integrated on economic level .
This can only be done by construc@@ ting a more democratic Europe on political level , a real popular European sovereignty .
To make Europe , let us make Europeans .
Chi@@ p maps without contacts become gener@@ alised
The worldwide chip map room opens on Tuesday at Vil@@ le@@ pin@@ te near Paris , in an optimistic atmosphere .
The year 2011 should actually end on an 11 % rise of worldwide sales of micro@@ process@@ ors ( Bank cards , teleph@@ ones with a SI@@ M card ... ) , with over 6 thousand million units , according to Euro@@ smart .
The most important sector is that of cont@@ ac@@ tless technology , which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a reader .
This year , 4@@ 60 million of cont@@ ac@@ tless chip cards should be sold worldwide , as against 3@@ 20 millions a year earlier !
Their share will progress in 2012 ( 5@@ 80 million units expected ) and represent almost 10 % of the global market of chip cards ( 6,@@ 9@@ 25 million cards ) .
For a long time , lag@@ ging behind the Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific region , Europe is now gaining ground in cont@@ ac@@ tless payment .
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 000 payment terminals accept them .
In France , the start is more modest ; 400@@ .000 cont@@ ac@@ tless Visa card are in use .
But the large stores are installing super@@ fast slo@@ ts .
This year , Car@@ re@@ four issued 2,5 million cont@@ ac@@ tless Master@@ Cards .
To achieve higher speeds , it is now necessary to equi@@ p their clients .
&quot; Two large French establishments have undertaken to distribute systematically in future to their clients , bank cards equipped for cont@@ ac@@ tless use , announ@@ ces G@@ ér@@ ard N@@ é@@ bou@@ y , Director@@ -@@ General of Visa Europe France .
Ban@@ ks are testing payment by mobile telephone
But this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment , namely , the mobile telephone .
Fe@@ w appar@@ atus are at present equipped with N@@ FC technology ( Near Fiel@@ d Communication , essential for implementing these transactions .
&quot; They have been delayed .
&quot; But they should really take wing next year . &quot;
&quot; We are counting on a worldwide sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , explains Marc Ber@@ tin , president of Euro@@ smart .
But the banks are for@@ ging ahead .
Yesterday , C@@ ré@@ dit Agri@@ col@@ e announced a test to run from next December to June in Ca@@ en .
The i@@ Ph@@ ones of some 200 clients and collabor@@ ators are going to be equipped to author@@ ise cont@@ ac@@ tless payment .
The B@@ PC@@ E has a similar project in Strasbourg and in Mar@@ sei@@ lle .
And the Soci@@ été G@@ én@@ ér@@ ale also said yesterday that it is preparing the market launch of an offer enabling its clients to pay via their mobil@@ es .
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is dis@@ qui@@ eted by links between the Islamic Mag@@ h@@ re@@ b and the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am sec@@ t .
Sus@@ pec@@ ted for a long time , the links between the terrorist group al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da in the Islamic Mag@@ h@@ re@@ b ( A@@ q@@ mi ) and the Nig@@ eri@@ an B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am sec@@ t have been confirmed .
On Sunday , the Alger@@ ian dep@@ uty foreign minister , Ab@@ del@@ k@@ ader Mess@@ ah@@ el , even stated that Al@@ gi@@ ers is now certain .
&quot; The manner in which the two organisations operate and the reports of secret services show that there is a lot of cooperation , he explained without elabor@@ ating .
Paris appears to make a similar analysis .
The inquiry into the ki@@ dn@@ app@@ ing of two Fren@@ ch@@ men in N@@ iger in January discovered two bridges .
The men ki@@ dn@@ apped men in a restaurant in Ni@@ am@@ ey by relatives of Aqu@@ i , An@@ to@@ ine de L@@ é@@ oc@@ our and Vinc@@ ent Del@@ ory had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their ki@@ dn@@ ap@@ pers during an operation launched by special French forces .
Among the rub@@ ble left behind by the action , French and Nig@@ eri@@ an investig@@ ators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
Terror@@ ist axis
The analysis of calls ex@@ changed indicates several inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors based in Mal@@ i , in N@@ iger and in Nigeria .
According to Radio France Internationale ( R@@ FI ) , two numbers interest the investig@@ ators in particular ; one leads to a Nig@@ eri@@ an who lived for a long time in Ma@@ i@@ du@@ gur@@ i , a town in Northern Nigeria , the cra@@ dle of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am and the other to a man said to be close to A@@ q@@ mi and to the sec@@ t .
&quot; This is an advance , but it is undoubtedly necessary to await more exact pro@@ o@@ fs before talking about operational cooperation between A@@ q@@ mi and B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am . &quot;
&quot; But it is possible . &quot;
&quot; It has been known for years that the sec@@ t benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active , says Kun@@ le A@@ mu@@ wo , a Nig@@ eri@@ an resear@@ cher .
In recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am and from its methods of operation , which increasingly include resort to kam@@ ik@@ az@@ es and to increasingly complex explo@@ sive engines of the same type as those used by A@@ q@@ mi .
The international community , starting with Washington , is now exer@@ ting pressure on A@@ bu@@ ja to take into account the problems caused by B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am .
Nig@@ eri@@ an authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of en@@ ligh@@ tened persons not worthy of interest .
Rap@@ id success
Found@@ ed in 2002 at Ma@@ i@@ du@@ gur@@ i around a mos@@ que , a school and a fundament@@ alist ima@@ m Moh@@ amm@@ ed Y@@ us@@ u@@ f , B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am - which means in Haus@@ a &quot; with Western education &quot; is a criminal , who promotes the installation of an islam@@ ic em@@ ir@@ ate in the Mo@@ sle@@ m north of Nigeria .
In this poor region , the association is enjoying rapid success .
It is poli@@ tic@@ ised and demands rigid respect of sh@@ aria , whilst its milit@@ ants engage in a struggle with the im@@ pi@@ ous central government .
The latter target primarily churches , bars and administrations .
In 2009 , the milit@@ ants of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am showed themselves particularly active , multi@@ plying attacks on police establishments .
The reaction of A@@ bu@@ ja is , as usual , without light and sha@@ de .
The army sur@@ rounds a town and leaves 800 dead behind .
Moh@@ amm@@ ed Y@@ us@@ u@@ f , arrested alive , was killed in prison .
Now the sec@@ t will become ra@@ dic@@ alised and will leave its northern fi@@ efs .
Last Christmas it claimed an attack , which left 80 dead at J@@ os and then more at A@@ bu@@ ja .
In June at A@@ bu@@ ja , B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am takes a secured police Q@@ G during a suicide attack , its first .
In August , the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target .
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa , which will move from Mau@@ rit@@ ania to Somalia via Nigeria , now dis@@ qui@@ ets all security specialists .
Now that A@@ q@@ mi has invested Mal@@ i and N@@ iger and the Som@@ alis of al-@@ Ch@@ eb@@ ab operate in Kenya , B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am appears to be a new men@@ ace in the continent .
Last week during an interview in Nigeria with president Goo@@ d@@ luck Jon@@ athan , Ala@@ in Ju@@ pp@@ é warned against B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am and declared himself ready to share all intelligence .
The world according to the republi@@ can presidential candidates
Conc@@ erning China , Iran , aid to Israel , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , Herman C@@ ain , and R@@ ick Per@@ ry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
Can an America weak@@ ened by crisis , lead a complex world by simple and indeed , simpli@@ stic , ideas ?
To listen to republi@@ can presidential candidates , the elec@@ tors might believe it .
For some days , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , Herman C@@ ain , R@@ ick Per@@ ry and the others multi@@ ply re@@ sound@@ ing and ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ated foreign policy declarations , which are traditionally a republi@@ can strong suit .
Conc@@ erning China , Iran and aid to Israel , the slo@@ gans , are often f@@ used together .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , the best placed for nom@@ ination of the &quot; Grand Old Party , &quot; threatened to drag the Chinese before the OM@@ C and to acc@@ use them of &quot; manipulation of their currency , a sensitive subject in an America ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia .
So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war , he said .
J@@ on Hun@@ ts@@ man , Obama &apos;s former amb@@ assador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to sup@@ press an attitude which flat@@ ters the emotions .
He called for a mus@@ cular , but a constructive , dialogue with Peking ( the current position of Obama ) .
But Hun@@ ts@@ man , who is stag@@ n@@ ating at the bottom of the p@@ olls , remains in@@ audi@@ ble .
In the style of Re@@ agan
Rom@@ ney also promised military strikes on Iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
&quot; If I am elected , I will stop Iran , he tru@@ mp@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; If Obama is re-@@ elected , they will have the bomb . &quot;
H@@ r also promised to increase military aid to Israel , acc@@ using Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner .
The entrepren@@ eur Herman C@@ ain , the second best-@@ placed candidate , decla@@ res an embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ing lack of knowledge of the files .
Recently , he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat , because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently un@@ aware of the fact that China has poss@@ essed it since 1964 !
The Texas govern@@ or R@@ ick Per@@ ry , who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran , says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against the drug car@@ tels .
Resort to the torture of terrorist sus@@ pects prohibited by Obama in 2009 , is also recommended by C@@ ain , Per@@ ry and by the candidate Mich@@ ele Bach@@ mann .
One is far away from the 2008 republi@@ can candidate John Mc@@ C@@ ain , a foreign policy heav@@ y@@ weight .
The opponents of the current president reply that Re@@ agan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war .
They recall that Obama himself was an am@@ ateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti-@@ terrorism .
They insist with good reason on the set@@ back of his nai@@ ve dialogue with Iran on the pre@@ mature departure of the &quot; boys &quot; from Iraq , his ter@@ gi@@ vers@@ ations in Libya labelling him weak .
But the attack is not so easy .
The population judges as positive Obama &apos;s the balance of national security , which eliminated B@@ in Laden .
Since Iraq , it di@@ stru@@ sts military interventions , which run into quick@@ s@@ ands .
And in argu@@ ing that it is necessary to re@@ construct America economically to revi@@ ve its leadership , Obama is right .
The North Stream , a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
The North Stream gas@@ duc@@ t connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea , has been commissioned .
It is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m , the giant Russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a &quot; b@@ ang . &quot;
Over 500 guests including four heads of State and of government took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic , between an orchest@@ ral performance and a fine buffet , in the inau@@ gu@@ ration of North Stream , the new gas@@ duc@@ t , which directly links Russia and Germany under the sea .
Sy@@ mbo@@ lic@@ ally , the German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the Russian president D@@ mit@@ ri Med@@ ve@@ dev , the French prime minister Franç@@ ois F@@ illon and his Dutch opposite number Mark R@@ ut@@ te jointly turned the val@@ ve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network .
With this new gas@@ duc@@ t , 27@@ ,5 thousand million additional c@@ ub@@ ic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 2@@ 24 km linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of M@@ eck@@ le@@ m@@ burg-@@ Pom@@ er@@ ania .
A second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million c@@ ub@@ ic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire French consumption .
And the possibility of construc@@ ting a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
For Gaz@@ pro@@ m , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .
The project was fi@@ erc@@ ely compet@@ ed for by Poland and the Baltic States .
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( Poland or the Ukraine ) .
These two countries will lose some of their power : it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets .
At the most critical point of the debate , Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new &quot; German-@@ Soviet pact , &quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occup@@ y Poland in 1939 .
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive .
By supporting this Russian project , Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .
But at the price of depri@@ ving Europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe .
Russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries , which consu@@ me large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are dec@@ lining .
&quot; This gas@@ duc@@ t is a component of partnership with Russia , it is a new ar@@ tery which links us organ@@ ically , &quot; confirmed Franç@@ ois F@@ illon inau@@ gur@@ ating the gas@@ duc@@ t , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
All this explains the broad sm@@ iles on the faces of the heads of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , present in large numbers at L@@ ub@@ min , the point of arrival of the gas .
The construction of this gas@@ duc@@ t is also a technical exploit .
The under@@ sea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships &apos; anch@@ ors .
I@@ r re@@ sts on the bottom of the sea , at an average depth of 200 metres .
To construct it , it was necessary to avoid min@@ e@@ fields dating back to the second World War .
&quot; A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precau@@ tion , &quot; says J@@ ens Müller , spo@@ kes@@ man of North Stream company .
It was also necessary to multi@@ ply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .
The pipeline is a long metal ser@@ p@@ ent , of weight equivalent to that of 24@@ 2 Eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no val@@ ves and no maintenance stations .
A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the Swe@@ des were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores .
&quot; In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , &quot; states J@@ ens Müller .
In the case of a le@@ ak , the gas contained in the gas@@ duc@@ t therefore escap@@ es into the air .
But this is thought to be unlikely by the construc@@ tors who provided wel@@ ds to le@@ ak only every 100 000 years .
The surveillance of the state of the gas@@ duc@@ t is provided by an under@@ sea ro@@ bot , pul@@ led by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an appar@@ atus circul@@ ating within the gas@@ duc@@ t .
Being ci@@ gar@@ -@@ shaped , it is introduced inside the 1-@@ met@@ re wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
On arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal de@@ formation .
The gas@@ duc@@ t was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .
This is 200 bar on leaving and 100 bar on arrival .
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project .
The leader remains Gaz@@ pro@@ m , which holds 51 % of the share@@ holding .
The others are the German companies E.ON and BAS@@ F ( 15.@@ 5 % each ) and the Dutch Gas@@ un@@ ie and the French Group G@@ DF Su@@ ez ( 9 % each ) .
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream , deleg@@ ated to construct and to operate the gas@@ duc@@ t .
It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m next le@@ ased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .
&quot; Gaz@@ pro@@ m will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , &quot; states J@@ ens Müller .
The financing of the construction of the gas@@ duc@@ t was provided to the extent of 30 % by the shareholders and of 70 % by Bank loans .
The total cost of the works will be 7.@@ 4 thousand million Euros for the two pi@@ pel@@ ines .
The G@@ DF Su@@ ez investment will be about 240 millions .
But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since Gaz@@ pro@@ m assumes the entire risk .
The gas@@ duc@@ t emer@@ ges from the Baltic sea at L@@ ub@@ min on a sandy litt@@ oral plan@@ ted with con@@ i@@ fers .
4.@@ 5 met@@ re high val@@ ves form the gas exit .
Sens@@ ors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gra@@ vities of arriving gas before being transferred into German gas@@ duc@@ ts .
Since last Tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million c@@ ub@@ ic metres of Russian gas every hour .
At full capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .
Mol@@ esk@@ ine , a brand card .
Cre@@ ated fifteen years ago by an Italian company , Mol@@ esk@@ ine will restore the taste of writing .
It is a sc@@ ent of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a cand@@ le .
The Mol@@ esk@@ ine note@@ book is easily recognised , by its black rec@@ tan@@ g@@ ular cover , its elas@@ tic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .
Nevertheless , the Mol@@ esk@@ ine note@@ book as we know it today , was born in 1997 .
The Italian company Mo@@ do Mo@@ do , based in Milan , decided to launch a designer note@@ book .
Maria Seb@@ reg@@ on@@ di , then a consul@@ tant of the company , has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .
The note@@ book draws its inspiration from an old production technique , the m@@ ole skin which means var@@ nis@@ hed cotton used for covering ben@@ ches , for example .
This type of note@@ book is said to be highly pri@@ zed by writers and travellers .
&quot; Mol@@ esk@@ ine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object , which was an av@@ ant@@ garde artists &apos; icon up to the XX@@ th century , &quot; related Maria Seb@@ reg@@ on@@ di , who has since become the manager of the brand name at Mo@@ do Mo@@ do .
Su@@ cc@@ ess is there .
Between 2006 and 2010 , sales rose by 25 % to reach 12.@@ 7 million units .
One has trav@@ elled far from the production of the first years , when only 3000 note@@ books were made .
Mol@@ esk@@ ine is crossing the Italian fron@@ tiers and is ex@@ porting to 70 countries , from France to the USA .
It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser , because the note@@ book attrac@@ ts equally a business@@ man , a student and a professional .
Mol@@ esk@@ ine consumers are cosmo@@ politan , open-@@ minded and cultiv@@ ated .
The small Italian company , which had only 12 employees at the start , now has almost 100 and two offices , one in Milan and the other in New York .
Its distri@@ butes its note@@ books to F@@ na@@ c libraries , small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known .
&quot; We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , not@@ with@@ standing the rise of e-mail , &quot; explains Maria Seb@@ reg@@ on@@ di .
This cultural signature ac@@ companies the development of Mol@@ esk@@ ine ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition &quot; Det@@ our &quot; where architects or artists exhi@@ bit their own note@@ book .
In August , it also launched a le@@ op@@ ard@@ skin pattern cover on the occasion of the Film Festival in Lo@@ car@@ no .
Explo@@ iting its success and the cultural au@@ ra , Mol@@ esk@@ ine diversi@@ fied its products to include hand@@ bags , p@@ ens , computer bags . The brand includes every kind of support .
A success , which ar@@ ou@@ sed en@@ vy ; in the autumn of 2006 , Mo@@ do Mo@@ do was bought by the investment fund S@@ G Capital Europe , now Syn@@ te@@ gra Capital , to write a new page in the history of Mol@@ esk@@ ine .
Why is the rate of unemployment of handic@@ apped workers so high ?
Some 19 % of handic@@ apped persons are looking for work .
The 15th week for the employment of the handic@@ apped starts today .
Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005 , the rate of unemployment of the handic@@ apped is still twice as high as the average , namely 19 % , ver@@ sus 9 % for the population as a whole .
Dis@@ coura@@ ging ?
&quot; No , stresses Eric Blan@@ chet , Director@@ -@@ General of A@@ da@@ pt , the association which organis@@ es the week for the employment of the handic@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable . &quot;
&quot; At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2@@ x but 3@@ x as high . &quot;
&quot; There is however still a huge amount to do . &quot;
It must be said that for the handic@@ apped , the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many .
They are rather old : 37 % are over 50 ( 17 % on average ) .
They have rather a low level of qualifications ; 80 % do not have the &quot; ba@@ c &quot; and out of the 2.@@ 3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handic@@ apped .
Lastly , long-term unemployment is very widespread , being 85 % for the handic@@ apped ver@@ sus 38 % on an average .
Brie@@ fly , all these are criteria which greatly complic@@ ate a return to employment and which constitute the nu@@ b of the problem , &quot; according to Christian Grap@@ in , direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of Tre@@ mp@@ lin , an association created in 1992 to help companies to recru@@ it handic@@ apped workers .
Here are some of the bra@@ kes .
It is hardly necessary to speak about ment@@ alities , which do change , but too slowly .
A study carried out in April by the association IM@@ S-@@ Ent@@ re@@ pr@@ end@@ re pour la Cit@@ é showed that the managers ques@@ tioned had a low level of knowledge of handic@@ ap , &quot; with an &quot; over-@@ representation of persons in whe@@ el@@ chairs , psych@@ ically or intellec@@ tually defici@@ ent persons . &quot;
Resul@@ t - private companies emplo@@ ying over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of emplo@@ ying the 6 % of handic@@ apped workers , fixed by a law dating back to 1987 .
The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.@@ 6 % .
&quot; We are now on around 3 % , &quot; says Pierre Blan@@ c , direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of the A@@ ge@@ fi@@ ph , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law .
Pro@@ of : The number of &quot; tax@@ ed &quot; establishments , like the sums paid , have fallen between 2007 and 2011 , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and from 6@@ 06 to 4@@ 80 million Euros ) .
&quot; The law of 2005 , which raised the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains Pierre Blan@@ c . &quot;
&quot; But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness , in particular within large groups . &quot;
According to the mini@@ stry of employment , only 59 % of establishments emplo@@ ying between 20 and 49 handic@@ apped persons , ver@@ sus 82 % of companies emplo@@ ying between 100 and 19@@ 9 persons .
Chance : &quot; What happiness &quot;
Before facing the Blu@@ es on Tuesday evening ( 20.@@ 45 hr@@ s ) Eden H@@ az@@ ard and Geor@@ ges Le@@ ek@@ ens did not hide the pleasure , which this friendly match gave to them .
We do not go so far as to say that there was con@@ ni@@ v@@ ance between them , but the image is symbolic .
Sit@@ ting side by side on the tri@@ b@@ une of the audi@@ t@@ orium of the Sta@@ de de France , Geor@@ ges Le@@ ek@@ ens and Eden H@@ az@@ ard made peace .
Five months following the gest@@ ure of hum@@ our of his attack@@ er against Turkey , the Belgian selec@@ tor can only be pra@@ ised .
&quot; I am very pleased with Eden , his progress and the fact that he is Belgian . &quot;
&quot; I want to go forward , assu@@ res the L@@ il@@ lo@@ is .
In contrast between his respective club and selection performances , &quot; it is of a piece if it is justified . &quot;
&quot; At L@@ ille , I am there all the year round , which is not the case of Belgium . &quot;
&quot; I must take my marks . &quot;
S@@ elected to play against Romania on Friday evening in its match against France , H@@ az@@ ard went to Saint-@@ Den@@ is in order at last to &quot; shine . &quot;
Not however for@@ getting the notion of &quot; pleas@@ ing . &quot;
He encouraged the Blu@@ es from the age of 7 years and the vic@@ t@@ orious campaigns of 1998 and 2000 .
&quot; I always supported them , he affir@@ ms .
This necessarily particip@@ ates in strengthening even more the particular character of this match .
All the more so , since opposite are Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u ( De@@ buch@@ y ) , Y@@ oh@@ an ( Cab@@ ay@@ e ) and A@@ di@@ l ( Ram@@ i ) , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
&quot; We just cro@@ ssed each others path . &quot;
&quot; To be able to play against them , that is pure happiness ! &quot;
With bon@@ hom@@ ie , Le@@ ek@@ ens rec@@ alled &quot; pride . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ de &quot; of playing in &quot; a g@@ ala match . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ de &quot; also in in@@ ding ass &quot; neigh@@ bour &quot; that France has &quot; become again a very high level team &quot; only a little more than one year after the trau@@ ma of Kn@@ ys@@ na .
&quot; Lau@@ rent Blan@@ c was a th@@ under@@ bol@@ t , he enth@@ uses .
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro , the technici@@ an will share an aircraft with the Blu@@ es management ... Brazil in 2014 .
&quot; Our little Belgi@@ ans become big , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; One is building something , the players are ambitious , they are hung@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; You will realise this during the matches to come . Inclu@@ ding that against France .
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Ben@@ to starts its return match against Bosnia ( 22@@ h@@ 00 ) very optim@@ is@@ tically , this Tuesday in Lisbon .
On their way there , both teams appeared to lack re@@ alism .
&quot; At the end of these 90 minutes , we will be a happy team and most importantly , a happy country . &quot;
Paulo Ben@@ to already sees himself in Poland and in the Ukraine .
For him there is not a shadow of a doubt , the S@@ election , with which he has been at od@@ ds since September 2010 , will qualify for Euro 2012 .
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness .
But there is match to play and an oppon@@ ent , Bosnia to con@@ quer .
In view of the ( 0-@@ 0 ) , on Friday in the hell of Zen@@ ica it is clear that the games are not over .
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour , it was not able to reach this precious target , which would have con@@ sol@@ ed it .
&quot; It is a good result , which nevertheless involves a certain risk &quot;
But on their side , in their illumin@@ ated Sta@@ de de la Lu@@ z in Lisbon , the Portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , &quot; said an optimistic , but lu@@ ci@@ d , Ben@@ to
&quot; We are expecting a very close match , but we are convinced that we can win , declared the Portuguese tra@@ iner aged 42 .
&quot; We continue to have a 50 % chance of being at Euro 2012 , &quot; even under the successor of Carlos Qu@@ ei@@ ro@@ z .
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia obli@@ ges the Portuguese to win .
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosni@@ ans .
&quot; It is a good result , which nevertheless carries some risk , regre@@ ts Ben@@ to .
&quot; We are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players poss@@ essing many individual qualities , &quot; he added .
As already in Zen@@ ica , the Portuguese would plan to exert maximal pressure on the Bosni@@ ans from the start , to &quot; give them no time to think . &quot;
A good idea , provided that it will , prove realistic this time .
What will they do ? CS@@ SD lacks knowledge of both Vol@@ dem@@ ort and cand@@ y bars in Prague
New Coun@@ c@@ il@@ ors of CS@@ SD will most probably have to overcome certain language barriers to understand their ol@@ d-@@ new colleagues from O@@ DS in Prague Council and municipal council .
Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz &quot; tested &quot; the Social Democra@@ t members of the new Council in terms of the well-@@ established s@@ lang that origin@@ ated in the town hall during the few last years , when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners .
Co@@ ded voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary that was established by Prague political elite during the previous era of the may@@ or P@@ av@@ el B@@ em , describes some of the most famous persons , situations and affairs in the city .
Sur@@ pris@@ ingly , it turned out that the new council members do not understand the well-known concepts .
At least they say so .
&quot; Who is Vol@@ dem@@ ort ? &quot;
&quot; I really do not know . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m rather a no@@ vice in Prague politics , &quot; responded Lu@@ kas Kau@@ cky , the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or for culture , to the test of &quot; Go@@ d@@ father &quot; voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
And even though he is a political veter@@ an , the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Karel Bre@@ z@@ ina responded simil@@ arly .
For instance regarding the term &quot; golf hole . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the only one of the presented words that I use at least occasionally . &quot;
&quot; Otherwise , I generally do not recognize the s@@ lang . &quot;
Out of the glo@@ ss@@ ary , published by Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz last June just before the Ele@@ ction Congress of O@@ DS , edi@@ tors selected six examples , mainly well-known in connection with the Prague City Hall .
The Socialists were to explain the concepts of &quot; Vol@@ dem@@ ort , &quot; the &quot; greatest golf hole in Prague , &quot; &quot; go to a cand@@ y bar , &quot; &quot; bul@@ l neck , &quot; &quot; betra@@ yal of the capital &quot; and &quot; to plate with metal . &quot;
Three Coun@@ c@@ il@@ ors agreed with the qui@@ z , the fourth - Ant@@ on@@ ín Wein@@ ert , who is to head the education in Prague in the future - promised to attend an interview first , but later he stopped answer@@ ing the phone .
The fifth Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or , Peter Dol@@ í@@ ne@@ k , refused the test straight away .
&quot; I do not pay attention to such things at all and I am not going to evaluate the way the Civi@@ c Democrats talk . &quot;
&quot; I am rather concerned how we will match our programs , &quot; he said .
As we already mentioned , Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Lu@@ kas Kau@@ cky would re@@ porte@@ dly not recognize in the above heading that it is about an influential entrepren@@ eur and friend of ex-@@ Mayor B@@ em , Roman Jan@@ ou@@ se@@ k .
&quot; Vol@@ dem@@ ort &quot; bears no meaning to Kau@@ cky and the only term he correctly gu@@ essed in the test is &quot; the greatest golf hole in Prague . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s Blan@@ ka tunnel , &quot; says Kau@@ cky , and immediately adds : &quot; But I know it from the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll have to get myself a language course , &quot; he qui@@ ps .
Golf hole as the Blan@@ ka tunnel was then correctly deci@@ pher@@ ed by not only the mat@@ ador Karel Bre@@ z@@ ina , but also the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or for the environment , Lu@@ kas Pla@@ chy .
Both Social Democrats then also know who is actually Vol@@ dem@@ ort and Lu@@ kas Pla@@ chy is familiar with this character - he also gu@@ esses the right meaning of the phrase &quot; to go to a cand@@ y bar . &quot;
&quot; That means going to a company in Prague &quot; he sa@@ ils close to the meaning , which is the office of Jan@@ ou@@ se@@ k &apos;s companies .
Similarly to Bre@@ z@@ ina he notes that he gained the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary himself .
According to the te@@ ste@@ es , there is no such gro@@ ov@@ y glo@@ ss@@ ary of s@@ lang terms in Social Democrats Party .
&quot; I even consulted my colleagues , but it seems that we really do not have anything like that . &quot;
&quot; We rather address one another with names , sometimes we use ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations and name gar@@ bles , &quot; said Prague CS@@ SD chairman Peter H@@ ul@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý , addressed by party members as H@@ ul@@ da .
&quot; At school I was called Bir@@ ch , but I do not know if my colleagues call me so , &quot; he ad@@ mits his own nick@@ name , Karel Bre@@ z@@ ina .
Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz tested the nick@@ name and it works .
Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Wein@@ ert is Gr@@ and@@ pa or less friendly Old Man for party members , the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Po@@ che , who won attention just before the election by the fraud in party spon@@ sor@@ ship , was nick@@ named &quot; I@@ gr@@ á@@ č@@ ek &quot; by some colleagues .
Nick@@ names are also the only thing accepted by the Social Democrats in the intra@@ -@@ party speech .
H@@ ul@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý re@@ porte@@ dly does not like to be addressed as H@@ ul@@ da , but Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz has also seen another nick@@ name of that Prague chairman .
&quot; Dr. of Black@@ -@@ jack Law &quot; supposedly rec@@ alls that Peter H@@ ul@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý got his De@@ gre@@ e of J@@ U@@ Dr at the Police Academy in B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va .
The government wants to limit the torture of &quot; wit@@ ches , &quot; a brochure was released
Women declared as wit@@ ches in Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o usually have several common characteristics .
They rather come from the older generation , cannot engage in work for health reasons for instance , are un@@ married and have no children .
The one who &quot; becomes &quot; a wi@@ tch is sent into isolation in order to not jeopardi@@ ze the rest of the village .
&quot; Such a fate be@@ falls men only very rarely . &quot;
&quot; Nor healthy young women are sent away because they help with work and bear children , &quot; says the nun , who takes care for more than a hundred women ban@@ ished from their community in a special care home in the capital of Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o , West Africa .
Local government now decided to combat the unusual &quot; social measures . &quot;
It has published an information book@@ let , which should help limit the wit@@ ch-@@ hun@@ t .
But there is a sn@@ ag in that .
&quot; More than 70 percent of adults in Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o cannot read , &quot; pointed out the disadvantage of written education Die Standard daily .
Acc@@ us@@ ations of wit@@ ch@@ craft are also common in other African countries .
In G@@ han@@ a , which borders with Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o , a sevent@@ y-@@ two Am@@ ma Hem@@ ma@@ h died last week after three women and two men tor@@ tured her , dou@@ sed in ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e and set ali@@ ght .
The case was reported by BBC .
The perpet@@ r@@ ators claim that it was an unfortunate coinci@@ dence .
According to their version the oil that is used for ri@@ tual ano@@ in@@ ting ign@@ ited and bur@@ ned the woman to death .
It alle@@ ge@@ dly bur@@ st into fl@@ ames after the group wanted to &quot; exp@@ el the evil spirit &quot; from the woman .
Isol@@ ation of &quot; wit@@ ches &quot; is widely supported by people regardless of their education level .
Da@@ ily Der Standard quoted a business@@ man of fort@@ y-@@ two from Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o : &quot; De@@ v@@ our@@ ers of human sou@@ ls have always posed a danger , &quot; he said .
While in Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o the government is trying hard to moderate the wi@@ tch hun@@ t , the G@@ ambi@@ a &apos;s President himself participated in the hun@@ t last year .
&quot; G@@ ambi@@ an President J@@ á@@ m@@ í after the death of his a@@ unt un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed a large-scale wit@@ ch-@@ hun@@ t for wit@@ ches alle@@ ge@@ dly involved in her death and trying to use black magic to kill the president . &quot;
&quot; He invited sh@@ am@@ ans from nearby Guinea to help him and they accompanied by poli@@ c@@ emen , soldiers and president &apos;s private security guards forced rand@@ om@@ ly selected men and women from G@@ ambi@@ an villages to the president &apos;s ran@@ ch in Kan@@ il@@ ai , &quot; said Am@@ nesty International in their report .
The arrested people had to drink a po@@ tion of her@@ bs with hall@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ genic effects , which also causes inte@@ st@@ inal and ki@@ dney problems .
Two prisoners did not survive .
After international pressure nearly a thousand of in@@ m@@ ates were released .
Bak@@ ala &apos;s ten@@ ant : Heating in the sto@@ ve , signed the rent increase
An older heav@@ y@@ set man wal@@ ked out of the door of the client center of R@@ PG F@@ lat@@ s Company owned by the &apos; coal bar@@ on &apos; Z@@ den@@ ek Bak@@ ala , the largest priv@@ ately owned rental apartments &quot; owner in the Czech Republic .
Under his arm he carried a folder with new lease contracts to three flat@@ s : his , his daughter &apos;s and his son &apos;s , who is in prison .
All the three &apos;s rent has just risen due to dereg@@ ulation .
From next year will the son pay C@@ Z@@ K 4@@ 100 for the second class 2 + 1 apartment instead of the current C@@ Z@@ K 3@@ 500 per month .
&quot; And there is no hot water and we must heat in the &quot; Pet@@ ra sto@@ ve &quot; ( solid fuel sto@@ ve , ed@@ . note ) &quot; the man points his finger on his son &apos;s new contract , which he is authorized to signed by pro@@ xy .
&quot; But I signed it , &quot; he says half an@@ gri@@ ly , half resi@@ g@@ ne@@ dly .
By@@ ty@@ O@@ K@@ D.@@ cz Civi@@ c Association , which identified the new ten@@ ancy conditions as &quot; unfair and imm@@ oral , &quot; adv@@ ises ten@@ ants not to sign the new contract and wait until 7 December , when they will publish a guidance on how to counter them .
But the man remains skep@@ tic .
&quot; One says this , another that , &quot; he fro@@ wns .
O@@ stra@@ va has become a great laboratory of dereg@@ ulation .
After the New Year the vast majority of d@@ well@@ ings with non-@@ market rent in the Czech Republic will be subject to dereg@@ ulation .
Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz therefore decided to visit the &quot; laboratory &quot; itself .
Hav@@ í@@ ř@@ ov &apos;s waiting room of R@@ PG is one of the four in the O@@ stra@@ va region and is already full at nine a.m. on Tu@@ es@@ da .
Stand@@ ing right at the door , there is a security guard from a security agency with a call device nearby .
Special button &quot; R@@ ent 2011 &quot; sh@@ ines on the touch screen .
One tap and the machine issues a sli@@ p with a number .
You do not even manage to read &quot; 15@@ 7 &quot; and your figure be@@ ep@@ s on the large screen below the ceiling of the waiting room .
It is your turn in half a second .
An older couple comes to ask about the lease after a few moments , there is apparently no rus@@ h for new le@@ ases in the waiting room at all .
Most people came to solve the same problems as usual - request for repa@@ irs , insu@@ red events etc .
Let@@ ters with new le@@ ases have been sent to mail@@ boxes of most of the ten@@ ants of 44 thousand d@@ well@@ ings R@@ PG portfolio in the O@@ stra@@ va region since about mid-@@ November .
R@@ PG By@@ ty proposes to increase rent by 15 to 38 percent in these letters .
A special desk for new le@@ ases was opened on 18 November in the client center .
&quot; It has been in operation for over a week , so it &apos;s only run@@ -in , &quot; respond the c@@ ler@@ ks at the desk after some he@@ si@@ tation , when the client introduces himself as a journalist .
Der@@ eg@@ ulation and Bak@@ ala &apos;s former mining flat@@ s are local hot topic .
Before the elections , it was quite lou@@ dly adopted by Parliament Vice-President and a native of O@@ stra@@ va L@@ ub@@ om@@ ir Z@@ a@@ or@@ al@@ ek of the Social Democrats , and even now it f@@ ills local newspapers .
&quot; I have been asking them for this new floor for twenty years . &quot;
&quot; They have not even changed a f .. king plate in the bathroom , &quot; relie@@ ves the man mentioned in the introduction .
It is mostly the reti@@ red who only come to see if they can I get a discount on rent if they sign on time , as R@@ PG their promises in their special offer .
Hal@@ f off the February rent will also receive the other ten@@ ants who will have signed the new contract by 15 December .
Hav@@ í@@ ř@@ ov &apos;s &quot; dereg@@ ul@@ atory &quot; desk is certainly not overwhel@@ med with questions .
&quot; Out of yesterday &apos;s 360 clients only about for@@ ty to fif@@ ty came to in@@ qu@@ ire about le@@ ases in 2011 , &quot; estimates the c@@ ler@@ k behind the counter .
R@@ PG on their bul@@ le@@ tin boards and Web site proposed the negotiation of individual contracts where needed .
However , if the parties fail to agree on the lease , an independent tri@@ bunal will have to establish the rent .
&quot; This is not a threat , but the information on the only possible legitimate and completely legal procedure , &quot; says R@@ PG on its website .
&quot; N@@ obo@@ dy will su@@ e them here , &quot; said one of the R@@ PG F@@ lat@@ s c@@ ler@@ ks and the man on the street outside the client center partly agrees .
&quot; I have C@@ Z@@ K 13@@ ,000 pension and five thousands are left for the meals , I cannot afford bringing it to the court , &quot; he said .
The c@@ ler@@ k but then doubts after all .
&quot; We &apos;ll see . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Z@@ a@@ or@@ al@@ ek adv@@ ises them in the media not to sign , so some people are waiting , &quot; she thinks .
The regulation of r@@ ents ends in the most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to R@@ PG By@@ ty is the increase of r@@ ents an economic necessity .
&quot; The current rent is still less than the amount needed for simple maintenance of housing stock , &quot; comm@@ ented P@@ av@@ el Klim@@ es , director of R@@ PG portfolio of residential apartments , and reminded that negle@@ ct of the housing stock compla@@ ined about in relation just to those an@@ gr@@ y ten@@ ants , is the main reason for the increase in r@@ ents according to the house owners .
While within the five years between 2005 and 2010 could R@@ PG invest four billion from the r@@ ents into the apartments , within the four years between 2011 and 2014 it should be 5.@@ 2 billion .
Large screen han@@ ging from the ceiling opposite the p@@ added seats of Hav@@ í@@ ř@@ ov &apos;s waiting room keeps repe@@ ating some information highlighted in red .
&quot; The increase in r@@ ents in 2011 by 15 % and less concerns 3@@ 1,@@ 200 flat@@ s , it is more than 90 % of R@@ PG apartments . &quot;
&quot; And it will always be a maximum of C@@ Z@@ K 7.@@ 50 per square meter and month , &quot; appears on the screen .
Only for 400 apartments of R@@ PG portfolio the rent will rise by 38 percent .
&quot; In these cases there will be an increase from an extremely low amount of C@@ Z@@ K 19.@@ 66 per square meter , &quot; points R@@ PG .
In 26@@ 00 apartments will the rent remain the same next year .
R@@ PG By@@ ty promises that dereg@@ ulation of r@@ ents will not be sudden , it will be spread over four to eight years .
It adds another commitment : all the money from rent increases ( see the chart ) will be invested by the company back to the flat@@ s , especially in heat savings - new windows and insul@@ ation .
Pri@@ ority will be given to people who sign the agreement to increase r@@ ents .
Off@@ ices need a kinder@@ garten nearby , architects have understood
Av@@ ri@@ o@@ point Office Building in Br@@ no is the new headquarters of Arch@@ .@@ Design Company .
N@@ obo@@ dy would expect that it contains a tiny kinder@@ garten with everything necessary - with colo@@ red walls , imagin@@ ative furniture , a b@@ unch of toys and even a mini@@ ature golf course on the outdoor terrace .
Since October last year the children of Arch@@ .@@ Design employees can attend .
Archit@@ ec@@ tural design company , Arch@@ .@@ Design , whose studios produced a number of important buildings in Br@@ no , have included the space for their corporate tiny kinder@@ garten even in the first drawings of the Av@@ ri@@ o@@ point building .
It indeed emplo@@ ys nearly 90 people - mainly bab@@ y-@@ bo@@ om@@ -@@ aged and they want their female designers and architects to quickly return to work .
Along with the possibility of part-@@ time contracts the kinder@@ garten is a benefit that Arch@@ .@@ Design offers to their employees within their welfare program .
F@@ em@@ ale construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to combine their demanding jobs with child care .
Tin@@ z kinder@@ garten has been invented by Ar@@ ch . Design employees themselves and with the support from management they were able to obtain a grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs .
Corporate tiny kinder@@ garten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Oper@@ ational Program Human Res@@ ources and Employment and state budget of C@@ Z .
Thanks to grant funding ( sub@@ sidy of 2.@@ 8 million ) they were able to purchase equipment and for the period of two years provide qualified personnel and operation .
After the de@@ ple@@ tion of financial aid ( 2 years ) the Arch@@ .@@ Design Company must operate the kinder@@ garten for 3 years at its own expense .
Pre@@ par@@ ation of the project la@@ sted one year and the Economy R@@ ating Company helped with the applications for grant significantly .
The care is provided by qualified staff , children are taken care of by a nur@@ se and a kinder@@ garten teacher all day ; the kinder@@ garten can therefore be attended by children without any age restrictions , but most of them are over 3 years old .
As this is a &quot; Mini-@@ kinder@@ garten , &quot; only 5 children may be present at the same time , even though more can attend in the course of the day altogether .
The operation of the kinder@@ garten is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the nur@@ ser@@ y , regardless of the position in the company hierarch@@ y .
Although this is an individual education and care , the program content in the mini-@@ kinder@@ garten is comparable with the framework program of pre@@ school education .
Children are not only playing here , they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school@@ ing and English is also taught here .
The class is not only equipped with toys , insp@@ iring games , but also with a computer that children can use .
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment .
Par@@ ents can always check their child and it prevents stress situations related to delayed pi@@ ck-@@ up from nur@@ series located far from their parents &quot; workplace .
Par@@ ents then use the working time much more efficiently .
Not surpris@@ ingly , a lo@@ yal employee - emplo@@ yer relationship is produced there naturally .
Arch@@ .@@ Design became one of the Czech companies , which offer significant benefit when recru@@ iting new employees , they are friendly to the family and through this program they have enhanced personnel marketing .
House of b@@ ones fascin@@ ates even after 100 years . Look at the inter@@ iors by Gau@@ di
The roof looks like a pre@@ historic liz@@ ard &apos;s sp@@ ine , the sta@@ ir@@ case remin@@ ds of a din@@ o@@ sau@@ r back@@ bone and balconies are open fish mou@@ ths .
This is the house of Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó in Barcelona by the Catal@@ an architect Ant@@ oni Gau@@ d@@ í .
The locals started to call it the House of b@@ ones for its organic shapes .
Organ@@ ic shapes , wild colors , unusual use of stone , frag@@ ments of tiles and mo@@ sa@@ ics , fac@@ ade remin@@ is@@ cent of sc@@ ales and soft cur@@ ves everywhere , all of which are typical of Art N@@ ou@@ veau by Ant@@ oni Gau@@ d@@ í .
The fac@@ ade of the house opens dre@@ am@@ y lines , soft colors and tex@@ tures remin@@ is@@ cent of nature and animals .
The detailed look reveals geom@@ etry , rhyth@@ m , and well-@@ considered order .
At night , the entire fac@@ ade of the house seems even more dramati@@ cal , it is lit so that the g@@ loss paint impression would be further enhanced .
Win@@ ding and twi@@ sting shapes appear equally as much in@@ doors .
W@@ ood follows in the window frames in the waves , along with hand@@ ra@@ ils , door tri@@ m , mol@@ dings and watch .
Bat@@ ll@@ ó House , located in the Ei@@ x@@ ample district on a busy shopping street Pass@@ ei@@ g de Gra@@ cia No@@ . 43 , was re@@ built from the original house in 18@@ 77 by the architect Em@@ ili@@ o S@@ al Cor@@ tes .
Rec@@ on@@ struction took place for two years and the house was completed in 19@@ 06 .
The investor , a weal@@ thy industri@@ alist Jose@@ p Bat@@ ll@@ ó , initially insi@@ sted on the demo@@ li@@ tion of the old building and construction of an entirely new one , but soon he adopted Gau@@ di &apos;s idea of an unusual and cheaper re@@ development of the house .
Apartment building Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó was nevertheless not designed by Ant@@ oni Gau@@ d@@ í alone .
Archit@@ ect Jose@@ p Maria Ju@@ jo@@ l co@@ operated with him .
It was his developer &apos;s board where the decor@@ ations for the representative apartment of the property owner were created , as well as the use of a mo@@ sa@@ ic on the fac@@ ade .
A number of other authors and artists worked on the fac@@ ade .
Joint work on dra@@ fts for Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó building started a successful cooperation of Ju@@ jo@@ l and Gau@@ di .
Ju@@ jo@@ l took part in the construction of Gau@@ di &apos;s building Casa Mil@@ a and Park Gu@@ ell , which contains other Gau@@ di &apos;s works .
The locals started to call it the &quot; House of b@@ ones &quot; for its organic shapes soon after its completion .
Others began to call it a &quot; y@@ a@@ wn@@ ing house &quot; for its specific mechanism of windows opening .
It is also said that on top of the building there is a representation of the s@@ word of St. George , the pat@@ ron of Catal@@ onia .
Other sculp@@ tural elements of the building also contain hidden religious mo@@ tives .
Gau@@ di designed a central heating system in the house , unique for his time , with ven@@ tilation and typical ch@@ im@@ neys .
Their fort@@ y-@@ five degree slope may seem bizarre .
When creating Gau@@ di totally dis@@ regarded building regulations of the time and did not let them tied him up .
At the start of construction he actually received a building permit from the city , but the provided details about the planned reconstruction were so vague , that two years after the completion the City Council was horri@@ fied by the result and asked for re@@ dress .
Coun@@ c@@ il@@ ors did mind for example that the building inter@@ fer@@ ed with its pillars into the public side@@ walk .
The correction never happened , rather the opposite : only fifteen days after the request from the city , Jose@@ p Bat@@ ll@@ ó applied for ( and successfully received ) the permission to lease the top two floors of the building .
The owner himself moved to lower floors .
There was a ban@@ quet hall in the gallery on the second floor and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private section of the apartment .
The ground floor was le@@ ased to a je@@ wel@@ ry .
The entire six-@@ st@@ ori@@ ed building is inter@@ sec@@ ted by a sta@@ ir@@ case , which ends only at the roof terrace .
The key elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right ang@@ les and straight lines and replacing them with cur@@ ved walls .
Gau@@ d@@ í also worked with the modern concept of space inter@@ connection .
The social part is completely connected by opening the s@@ alo@@ on door and a larger group can comfortably communicate without losing the necessary privacy for intimate convers@@ ations .
The house won due to Gau@@ di &apos;s re@@ building a new fac@@ ade and also the unusual roof and two extra floors .
Gau@@ di &apos;s play with light is also impressive , along with blue and white gla@@ zed tiles used to line the inner courtyard and sky@@ lights .
The play of two colors delivers a maximum of light on all floors of the house .
It was enough to gam@@ ble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark colors , which absor@@ b the sun &apos;s rays on the contrary .
Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó House , which was included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005 , can be visited by anyone .
The most spacious and most luxurious apartment has been opened to the public on the first floor .
The owners decided to move this up in 2002 to celebrate the one hundred fif@@ tieth anniversary of the birth of the famous author .
They kept providing the excursions since they discovered that this is a very profitable business , plus they extended tours by the common and at@@ tic spaces , including a roof terrace .
Ad@@ mission to the sight is certainly not neg@@ ligi@@ ble , amounts to 16.@@ 50 euros , while students , sen@@ iors , groups and travel passes holders receive a twenty percent discount .
The amount greatly excee@@ ds the price of admission to other Gau@@ di &apos;s buildings in the city .
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dra@@ gon towers , you have to quickly make friends with any of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit them at home .
How to choose the mat@@ tress and the s@@ lat@@ ted bed base : Women have different requirements from men
Not luxurious bed frame , but the quality of the lying area , that is the mat@@ tress and s@@ lat@@ ted bed base gives a really good bed .
They must however match in a harmonious way to suit a specific user .
The selection decisions are influenced by lots of things such as the weight , height , age , health , and gender of the owner .
Also the type of interior , into which the mat@@ tress and s@@ lat@@ ted base are purchased , is important .
A typical example ?
For instance for summer houses which are not heated regularly , lat@@ ex mat@@ tre@@ sses are not suitable because they warm up rather slowly .
In addition , they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard poly@@ ure@@ th@@ ane fo@@ am mat@@ tress .
It is also necessary to turn them regularly .
If they do not have enough vent@@ ing channels in their core , and still lie on a hard board , they retain mo@@ ist@@ ure : Even m@@ old could occur bene@@ ath the mat@@ tre@@ sses .
The choice is also influenced by hab@@ its .
Who spent more time abroad , where they often use very thick mat@@ tre@@ sses with sof@@ tening layer , they will find it hard to feel good on a thin one with hard surface .
&quot; Perhaps all ho@@ ckey players returning from the N@@ H@@ L compla@@ ined to me that they were sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; Their bat@@ tered shoul@@ ders , he@@ els and hi@@ ps needed the mat@@ tress to be sof@@ tened with a layer of la@@ zy fo@@ am . &quot;
&quot; Those are recommended even for people with di@@ abetes who have a ner@@ vous system dis@@ order , so they assume &apos; information &apos; from the jo@@ ints and skin in an ill way , &quot; explains Sy@@ l@@ via H@@ ad@@ am@@ c@@ zi@@ ko@@ va , who speciali@@ zes in up@@ hol@@ stered furniture .
She therefore looked for la@@ zy fo@@ am mat@@ tre@@ sses for many ho@@ ckey players , but also other customers years ago .
&quot; Now it &apos;s ok@@ ay , suitable mat@@ tre@@ sses can be found at Temp@@ ur , Italian Mag@@ ni@@ fle@@ x , but also Czech Trop@@ ico . &quot;
You need not be an N@@ H@@ L guy to appreciate the la@@ zy fo@@ am .
This &quot; mi@@ racle &quot; works in a simple manner .
Optim@@ izes its rigi@@ dity and shape by the heat absor@@ bed or adap@@ ts to your body warm .
You feel no press and will not keep changing position on your bed all night as if you were after a tough game .
You will just sleep better .
L@@ az@@ y fo@@ am also works well as a protection against pressure so@@ res .
When choosing the size of your mat@@ tress thi@@ ckness , add one foot length to your height , which is about 2@@ 1-@@ 34 cm .
Man and woman with a height of about 180 cm then need a bed of 2@@ 10-@@ 220 cm .
The minimum width for one should be 90@@ cm in double bed , i.e. 180 cm altogether .
In separate beds , for example for sing@@ les , it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm .
For both usual comfort and a possible visitor .
&quot; Otherwise the rule for bed width is simple : when lying on your back , you should keep your hands comfortably slightly b@@ ent at the el@@ bow , &quot; adv@@ ises In@@ g . Hel@@ ena Pro@@ ko@@ po@@ v@@ á , head of the Guil@@ d of up@@ hol@@ ster@@ ers and decor@@ ators , who has addressed the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonom@@ ics of furniture for many years and te@@ aches it to col@@ leg@@ es .
For everyone needs their own mat@@ tress and a s@@ lat@@ ted base in a double bed , be careful to buy match the thi@@ ckness of mat@@ tre@@ sses when buying them .
Otherwise you will have to fit into s@@ lat@@ ted bases into different hei@@ ghts , which may not be possible with every frame of the bed .
Fo@@ am mat@@ tress should be at least 14 cm , while the frame types with a spring framework should be at least 15 cm , including at least three cen@@ tim@@ eters count for the shaping and sof@@ tening layer .
&quot; You must not feel the springs when tou@@ ching the mat@@ tress with hands or sitting down on the mat@@ tress , &quot; war@@ ns Hel@@ ena Pro@@ ko@@ po@@ va .
Each mat@@ tress requires a certain type of s@@ lat@@ ted base .
U@@ ph@@ ol@@ stered beds , where the mat@@ tress and the foundation are like con@@ joined Si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , should not appear in bedrooms .
It is hard to air the mat@@ tre@@ sses ; you can not w@@ ash the fabric either , which should be a must today .
And since we normally per@@ sp@@ ire 0.@@ 2 to 0.@@ 75 li@@ ters of swe@@ at during the night , it is obvious that after five to seven years the mat@@ tress will res@@ emble a large ( and clo@@ gged ) sie@@ ve .
That &apos;s why experts refuse advertising slo@@ gans of life of the mat@@ tress up to 25 years , or even a lifetime warranty .
Everything has its pro@@ s and cons .
Therefore , the practical advice from vend@@ ors is as follows : Do not give up hygiene for mat@@ tre@@ sses with a width of 120 and 140 cm and their remo@@ vable and was@@ hab@@ le cover , rather add a mat@@ tress protec@@ tor , which can be easily removed and wash@@ ed .
Although today mat@@ tress covers are now commonly manufactured with a zip around the per@@ im@@ eter , so after opening you get two parts ( vital for washing and the size of washing machine ! ) , handling the larger types when removing them ( and in one person ) may remind of a match of ligh@@ t-@@ weight figh@@ tn@@ ig a heavy one in the ring .
Do you have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a s@@ lat@@ ted base ?
Ne@@ ver !
If so , then only in a bed for one-@@ night visitors .
The board should nevertheless be equipped ( if not already ) with ven@@ tilation holes and use the mat@@ tress with spring framework of a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in the bags ( from German Ta@@ schen@@ feder@@ kern ) and a sof@@ tening layer .
Poly@@ ure@@ th@@ ane mat@@ tre@@ sses should not be on such a basis .
For non-@@ positioning s@@ lat@@ s with 14-@@ 18 bla@@ des , lat@@ ex or sand@@ wich mat@@ tre@@ sses will be suitable ( maybe a combination of lat@@ ex and co@@ con@@ ut ) , but it always pays back to get the s@@ lat@@ ted bases with larger number of bla@@ des , 28 or more , where there are double bla@@ des in the lum@@ bar area and their sti@@ ff@@ ness can be regulated .
Mat@@ tre@@ sses with spring frames should not lie on adju@@ stable s@@ lat@@ s as they do not respond to positioning .
In addition to adju@@ sting the sti@@ ff@@ ness of s@@ lat@@ s you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cra@@ dle .
This is a special mounting of bla@@ des , which enables to push , or even ti@@ lt the plate so that the arm of the sle@@ ep@@ er would nicely &quot; fit into the mat@@ tress . &quot;
For men whose shoul@@ ders are &quot; all over their back , &quot; this is certainly an important thing .
Even mat@@ tress manufacturers respect it when in &quot; men &quot; mat@@ tre@@ sses they began to use the sof@@ tening zone right in the shoulder area .
They also remember the women - those indul@@ ge in the so@@ fter surface of the hip area .
A@@ il@@ eron or lam@@ ell@@ ar grat@@ ings with the so-called multi-@@ tor@@ sion suspension are intended for the most demanding customers .
The pressure is spread into several points and the tension reduces .
But be careful when you use a wrong pil@@ low with a correct mat@@ tress and s@@ lat@@ ted base ( large and &quot; stu@@ ff@@ ed &quot; ) , most of the &quot; pl@@ uses &quot; will disappear .
The basic rule is simple : The cus@@ hion should support the head and touch the shoul@@ ders with its cor@@ ners so that the shoulder mus@@ cles could relax .
A suitable size of 50 x 60 c@@ mis recommended , preferred for example in Scandin@@ a@@ via .
When lying on the side , the pil@@ low should be able to deal ( along with the shoulder cra@@ dle of the s@@ lat@@ ted bed or sof@@ tened zone in the mat@@ tress ) with shoulder height .
Modern mat@@ tre@@ sses do have something in common with original mat@@ tre@@ sses filled with gra@@ sses .
Their manufacturers increasingly use natural materials , or at least ad@@ mix@@ tures .
There is simply an organic trend even in mat@@ tre@@ sses .
Ra@@ w materials from oil , out of which poly@@ ure@@ th@@ ane fo@@ am is made , are being replaced with natural oils , such as from so@@ y and cast@@ or-@@ oil plant .
It is just so@@ y that all well-known manufacturers use now .
&quot; Organ@@ ic in mat@@ tre@@ sses means that the core is made of purely natural material , &quot; explains Pet@@ r V@@ asi@@ c@@ ek from the company Trop@@ ico Plus .
Natural products are also used in the production of mat@@ tress covers , one of the first was alo@@ e ver@@ a .
But you can also indul@@ ge in micro@@ cap@@ su@@ les that can release fresh sc@@ ent of la@@ ven@@ der or forest .
There is even a division for men and women .
While men are &quot; cool@@ ed &quot; by her@@ bal extract of bir@@ ch , so that the mat@@ tress cover would absor@@ b heat and cool the body , women are on the contrary &quot; war@@ med &quot; by the covers .
The extract of red pe@@ pper increases circulation of blood , so the weaker sex feels war@@ mer .
Today &apos;s favor@@ ites ?
Mat@@ tress made of cold fo@@ am ( with larger po@@ res with a damaged cell structure is more breath@@ able than regular poly@@ ure@@ th@@ ane and has a better elas@@ tic@@ ity .
Com@@ bin@@ ing different sti@@ ff@@ nesses of cold fo@@ ams and &quot; la@@ zy &quot; fo@@ am result in multi-@@ zone mat@@ tre@@ sses that know exactly where the head should be , as well as shoul@@ ders and he@@ els .
You will pay seven thousand cro@@ wns and above for a good quality mat@@ tress .
Those that meet health parameters tend to have lower rate of VAT as they are considered medical equipment .
Gu@@ mo@@ tex was the first to employ this advantage in the Czech Republic .
It is not easy to save on the mat@@ tress and the s@@ lat@@ ted base .
Sometimes you can use special offers of manufacturers or re@@ tail@@ ers , who offer two mat@@ tre@@ sses for the price of one .
For instance Mag@@ ni@@ fle@@ x brand offers their Du@@ o@@ free@@ ze mat@@ tress with the memory fo@@ am Memory se@@ wn into the cover for 11 9@@ 90 cro@@ wns .
However , you can get the second one for free .
The era of la@@ zy or vis@@ co@@ elas@@ tic fo@@ ams with open cell structure and high density was started by Temp@@ ur material in a &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic &quot; pace .
It was originally developed as a material for N@@ ASA because the a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts were exposed to enormous over@@ exter@@ tion during the start .
Temp@@ ur sof@@ tens when warm , but strength@@ ens in the cold .
It is then perfectly adapted to warm human body and sp@@ reads its pressure optim@@ ally .
It is therefore ideal to prevent pressure ul@@ cer development , but also to enhance comfort while sleeping .
Vis@@ co@@ elas@@ tic fo@@ ams are used not only for mat@@ tre@@ sses , but also medical products , such as special pil@@ lows under the feet , which mitig@@ ate the legs and ven@@ ous system .
Dom@@ estic producers use the fo@@ am T@@ win@@ sa@@ ver or Eu@@ ca@@ ther@@ m C and such .
De@@ vi@@ ces for people monitoring are required by more and more parents , who want to watch their children
Fe@@ ar for their own child brings more people to the idea of watching them using GPS .
The system originally created to search for cars could also monitor the movement of people and thus should help in cases such as the dis@@ appearance of n@@ ine-@@ year-old An@@ nie Jan@@ at@@ kov@@ á .
The facility is currently of the size of a mat@@ ch@@ box , but it may soon be as big as a watch .
Many people have been sc@@ ared by the case of missing An@@ nie and thus began to search for ways to protect their children better .
Even at the cost of dis@@ ruption to their privacy .
&quot; We say to all that it is not sp@@ ying , but a means to further reduce the prob@@ ability that a tragedy happens , &quot; said Pet@@ r P@@ ili@@ n of the Mac@@ ro Weil , one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market .
&quot; I admit that under certain circumstances it may lead to mis@@ use of such equipment , if they are put in a bag of someone who does not know it , but we have not seen such cases yet . &quot;
&quot; Most customers actually buy it for security reasons , &quot; he added .
According to him , the child should always know for what the purpose of the &quot; box &quot; is and how it is used in an emergency .
Child psych@@ ologist Dan@@ a Bo@@ č@@ kov@@ á points out that if a child does not want to wear something like that , it will just get rid of it .
&quot; Even very young children show great creativity how to lose some things on purpose if they do not want to be under control . &quot;
&quot; Great parents &apos; expectations were fu@@ eled by cell phones before , but those can be swit@@ ched off as well as this tracking device , &quot; says Bo@@ č@@ kov@@ á .
According to her it is question@@ able whether , in the event of an attack such a device would really help .
&quot; As for the upcoming ki@@ dn@@ app@@ ing , the perpet@@ r@@ ator almost always ensures that the child should not carry any electronics that might reveal his position . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the phone now . &quot;
&quot; When tracking devices get more common , they will look for those , because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising . &quot;
&quot; In this case , the criminals are always one step ahead of police , &quot; says the psych@@ ologist .
She ad@@ mits , however , that similar devices may help in case of sudden attack by a ped@@ ophi@@ le .
According to Robert Ce@@ ch of RC Monitoring Company that provides tracking services for both cars and for people , even when there is an attack and immediate destruction of the tracking device , its presence can help .
&quot; The device can be set to send regular position report after a certain period of time . &quot;
&quot; If it becomes damaged , we will have at least the last position of the person . &quot;
&quot; The more expensive devices have in-@@ built and til@@ t@@ meters , so even if one just ski@@ ds and remains lying mo@@ tion@@ less , the device immediately sends a warning with location , &quot; says Czech .
According to him a similar service may be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation , where it is enough to load a special software .
The problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device similar to pen@@ dants of mat@@ ch@@ box size or smaller mobile phones .
There is always the risk of their loss .
According to P@@ ili@@ n from the Mac@@ ro Weil Company a device that looks like a conventional digital watch is now being tested .
&quot; This will be the biggest advantage that the ag@@ gress@@ or may not even recognize the tracking device at all . &quot;
&quot; Or they recognize it after some time and it may give the police extra time , &quot; he adds .
Whether you the tracking devices develop into bra@@ cel@@ ets or pen@@ dants , they are still using the same technology as that used for monitoring vehicles .
It is a combination of location detection via GPS ( used by regular car navigation ) and the functions of a mobile phone , which reports the current vehicle position .
The army has enough ign@@ iter cor@@ d to wind the whole of Czech Republic . But they will exp@@ ire in only two years .
Czech army has purchased 4@@ 45 kilometers of cor@@ ds , which de@@ ton@@ ate explo@@ si@@ ves .
Already last year the Ministry of Defence delivered 2@@ 24 km of the cor@@ ds lines into the ware@@ houses .
The army thus has reserves for 2@@ 25 years .
The problem is that life of the lines is two to four years .
The Army purchased the de@@ ton@@ ating cor@@ ds from S@@ TV Group , Inc. for C@@ Z@@ K 40 million .
The General Staff provided the reason@@ ing for buying such a huge quantity of ign@@ iter cor@@ ds to M@@ F D@@ nes stating that soldiers use 60 km of ign@@ iter cor@@ ds in training per year .
Cal@@ cul@@ ations of army bomb disposal experts that the M@@ F D@@ nes appro@@ ached imp@@ ly that it would be a very intense py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ic training that would be under@@ gone also by all the gener@@ als every year , along with the officers of the army , secre@@ t@@ aries and clean@@ ers .
Def@@ ense Minister Alexand@@ r V@@ on@@ dra and army comm@@ ander V@@ las@@ tim@@ il P@@ ick included .
Only thus could be the army annual consumption of six@@ ty kilometers of ign@@ iter cor@@ ds justified .
This period corresponds to 25@@ ,000 explo@@ sions .
And even if it were true , the army reserves would be enough for more than ten years .
However , if the basic training of any new professional actually needed just two meters of the ign@@ iter cor@@ d , as the experts say , then the army has ensured by the purchase - even with increased consumption by engineer or special units - the stock for the above 2@@ 25 years .
Rap@@ id Dep@@ lo@@ yment Bri@@ ga@@ de soldiers personally compla@@ ined recently to the minister V@@ on@@ dra that they have almost no amm@@ uni@@ tion for small arms and so sho@@ ot@@ ings are limited due to shortage of money .
Not mentioning the lack of under@@ wear .
&quot; I do not understand either , that they buy so many ign@@ iter cor@@ ds from us repeatedly . &quot;
&quot; But it &apos;s their decision , and they certainly know what they will use them for . &quot;
&quot; For us , the army is a good customer , whose demands we try to meet as re@@ tail@@ ers , &quot; says the sales manager of S@@ TV Group , Jan D@@ ě@@ ck@@ ý .
Def@@ ense Ministry spo@@ kes@@ man Jan Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k reasons for the purchased hundreds of kilometers of cor@@ ds by creation reserves of such &quot; m@@ uni@@ tions &quot; for ten years at least .
Jan D@@ ě@@ ck@@ ý of S@@ TV Group , however , speaks only of the four-@@ year life of the cor@@ ds and police or army de@@ min@@ ers even of mere two years .
&quot; If stored under perfect conditions , it can be even four , &quot; said one , who as a soldi@@ er does not want to dis@@ close the name when critici@@ zing the military .
After exp@@ iry date any amm@@ uni@@ tion must be carefully tested for reliability to make sure it does not en@@ danger the life of soldiers .
These tests are not free and it cost more money .
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount on 4@@ 45 km of the ig@@ ni@@ tion cor@@ ds .
&quot; It cost us about six@@ ty percent less than last year &apos;s supply of two hundred fort@@ y-@@ four kilometers , &quot; says the speaker Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence .
Just for comparison : Annual consumption of fir@@ ing lines of police de@@ min@@ ers who destroy m@@ uni@@ tions from World War II and the one left after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1500 meters for several years .
A police orders only such amount of the amm@@ uni@@ tion that would be used before its exp@@ i@@ ration .
It paid back for the safety of de@@ min@@ ers and the flexibility to acquire more modern and thus more reliable types of lines .
Ministry of Defence has already considerable problems with the liqui@@ dation of tens of thousand tons of amm@@ uni@@ tion from the times of the Warsaw Pact , when the two-@@ hund@@ re@@ d-@@ thousand Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ ak army was preparing to set off for the Rhine .
The Czech one , according to the py@@ ro@@ technici@@ ans appro@@ ached by M@@ F D@@ nes , will face the same problem in a few years : They will dis@@ pose of hundreds of kilometers of old ign@@ iter cor@@ ds that are currently &quot; che@@ ap@@ ly &quot; purchased .
To this day I use the contacts I gained through the competition
W@@ inning the prize in the Ent@@ re@@ pren@@ eur of the year helped Lu@@ kas Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n sell the fran@@ chise of his hotel .
The winner of last year &apos;s Ent@@ re@@ pren@@ eur of the year was a twenty-@@ eigh@@ t-@@ year-old entrepren@@ eur Lu@@ kas Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n from Liber@@ ec .
His success story is much like one from a movie .
Lu@@ k@@ á@@ š Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n liked to travel .
And abroad he realized that Liber@@ ec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price .
Using his savings from foreign part-@@ time jobs and a bank loan he purchased a ru@@ ined house with five apartments .
It was a great courage considering that at that time he was still a student of the third year at university .
&quot; The ratio between quality and price of accommodation of the time in our country made me I try to do something , &quot; says Lu@@ kas Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n .
The first renovated apartment he r@@ ented to foreign workers .
All profits were invested back into the house , which he gradually remo@@ del@@ ed into a boarding house with 54 beds .
Since then , he has managed to gradually open four guest houses in Liber@@ ec within the seven years of his business , along with two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds across all categories of accommodation .
Until recently , the most comfortable one was Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n four-@@ star design hotel .
This year another one was open , equally good .
&quot; We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ost@@ ro@@ v u T@@ ise , where we sold our fran@@ chise concept and others interested in the Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n hotel fran@@ chise are applying , &quot; says last year &apos;s number one tra@@ der .
&quot; And the sale of the license to operate the hotel was very much influenced just by winning the competition Ent@@ re@@ pren@@ eur of the year , &quot; appreci@@ atively adds Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n .
The victory brought more reputation and popularity in Liber@@ ec and its surroundings .
&quot; People recognized me in the streets , often addi@@ tionally congratul@@ ated me and I must say it felt good , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
He strongly encourages all who are e@@ ager to try something to participate in the competition .
It is not necessary to win , any visibility is good .
He says he still draws on contacts and acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , which would perhaps not get otherwise .
&quot; With some I &apos;ve met through the competition , I started a regular business . &quot;
In his opinion , the gl@@ ory associated with the success land@@ ed a bit on each employee .
And there are about sevent@@ y of them .
&quot; I see them show greater loyalty and pride that they are involved in something that gained universal recognition . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s much more than just my personal success , as it is the result of good work of all of us together . &quot;
&quot; Only my name is thr@@ ust into the fore@@ front , &quot; says Lu@@ k@@ á@@ š Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n mo@@ dest@@ ly today .
I wish my successor qui@@ eter year than we had in Far@@ met
E@@ up@@ h@@ oria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis .
With self-@@ discipline of the winner Far@@ met has already overcome bad times .
Prize for the first place in last year &apos;s Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one competition Company of the Year was in the Sla@@ v House collected by the owner of Far@@ met Company , Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which a small tool workshop in Ces@@ ka Sk@@ ali@@ ce grew into a business with hund@@ re@@ d-@@ million tur@@ no@@ vers .
&quot; I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for batt@@ les with the competition , &quot; says the la@@ st-@@ year winner today .
In the early history of the Far@@ met company there was a desire to do something useful .
And so , when the state offered the father of Charles Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ é@@ ho to rent a small workshop to compensate for the commun@@ ist@@ s-@@ conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated property , he did not hesitate any long , rejected a career in the company , where he was working , and with a few friends around his father he founded the company producing plastic tu@@ bs .
So@@ on after that they began to speciali@@ ze in vegetable oil pres@@ ses .
After eigh@@ teen years , they became the largest manufacturer of automatic pres@@ ses in Central Europe .
Gre@@ ater awareness among the general public was won after the success in the competition through the media .
&quot; Not only our customers have begun to perc@@ eive the brand Far@@ met much better , but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they work with a company that has achieved greater success in its home country , &quot; says Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
Last year , however , was not only full of the eu@@ ph@@ oria of vic@@ tories in F@@ AR@@ ME@@ T .
Awards were based on firm economic performance until 2008 and only partly from 2009 .
And just 2009 was the tou@@ gh@@ est year for the sale of engineering goods .
Cri@@ sis was at its very peak , not tou@@ ching so many people yet , but companies had stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology .
&quot; The situation obviously did not spare us . &quot;
&quot; Sales fell by 40 percent , we had to restrict production and even discharge employees , &quot; explains Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
A viable company must be able to take even such un@@ popular measures sometimes .
However , they managed and retained the profit , even though lower than before the crisis .
However , what F@@ AR@@ ME@@ T would not compromise , is the investment in research and development .
&quot; With the help of subsidies we have built a research and training center , we have enhanced our presentation at international fairs , won major awards in local exhibitions , &quot; says Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
The crisis seems to be behind them .
Re@@ venues are growing again and so is the number of new employees .
&quot; I wish the nice feeling of victory to the new winner , but in a more peaceful atmosphere , &quot; says Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
Sur@@ v@@ ey that remo@@ ves absurd regulations
Pol@@ l of the Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties is a part of the business competition for the fourth time .
Some ridicul@@ ous regulations have are already been removed .
In@@ famous winner of next year &apos;s Pol@@ l of Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties was the absurd obligation to bring documents that are accessible for officials online to the authorities .
It was chosen by more than a third of almost four thousand votes .
For example , Social Security Administration required a paper certificate of incorpor@@ ation , although the officer can obtain one by two cli@@ cks of a mouse .
Thanks to the pol@@ l , this will change .
&quot; The Czech Social Security Administration will not require the certificate of incorpor@@ ation from for controls of contribut@@ ors , &quot; said spo@@ kes@@ man Jan@@ a Bur@@ á@@ ň@@ ov@@ á of CS@@ SA .
To cra@@ ck down on all the rules and regulations that companies and businesses in the Czech Republic must meet , and remove those that lack sense , is the essence of the Pol@@ l of Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties .
This is the fourth time this year , it has been a part of the business competition , held by Ho@@ spo@@ d@@ á@@ ř@@ sk@@ é nov@@ iny and it is becoming increasingly popular among the public .
If about three thousand voters were involved in the vote last year , there were nearly four thousand voters earlier this year .
And not surpris@@ ingly , there are still many legal obligations , which only serve to delay the business .
&quot; For instance in the number of papers required for tax returns we keep the top places in the world , &quot; said Karel Hav@@ lic@@ ek of the Association of Small and Medi@@ um-@@ sized Enter@@ prises and Cra@@ fts in CR .
Simp@@ li@@ fication of business has in recent years become a stated objective of all governments .
But compared with the rest of the world the situation has not really improved in the Czech Republic .
According to the World Bank , in terms of business conditions the Czech Republic was ran@@ ked 7@@ 4th position ; it is eight points less than last year .
The Pol@@ l of Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties was first launched in 2006 and takes place every year under the same scenario .
Anyone may propose administrative and bureaucratic non@@ senses every year from April to September , when is there is the deadline for the competition .
In order to sign for the competition , website H@@ Y@@ PER@@ LIN@@ K &quot; http : / / www.@@ fir@@ mar@@ ok@@ u.@@ cz &quot; is to be used . Organ@@ iz@@ er then choo@@ ses the seven candidates for the &quot; anti-@@ award &quot; and allows the public vote for it in October at the website www.@@ fir@@ mar@@ ok@@ u.@@ cz / absur@@ di@@ ta and www.@@ ih@@ ne@@ d.@@ cz .
The absur@@ dity that gets most votes wins .
In this survey more than a hundred , 105 to be precise , meaning@@ less rules and regulations were filed .
Ti@@ ps were received from entrepreneurs , but also professional associations and journalists .
Among the &quot; fin@@ alists &quot; of the contest was for instance the requirement that the trucks for maintenance of high@@ ways were to pay ro@@ ad-@@ t@@ olls , or that businesses with twenty employees , two offices and two toi@@ lets had those painted every two years .
The list of this year &apos;s seven proposals is posted on the website of the contest .
An@@ no@@ un@@ cement of the competition , which always takes place in early November on Wen@@ ces@@ las Square in Prague is part of the ha@@ p@@ enn@@ ing , regularly attended by person@@ alities of the political and social life .
This year , for example , the fin@@ ale of the competition was assisted by E@@ va Sv@@ obo@@ dova , director of the Association of Small and Medi@@ um-@@ sized Enter@@ prises and Cra@@ fts in CR and Pet@@ r Ku@@ zel , president of the Chamber of Commerce in CR .
&quot; Economic prosperity can not work where the state is thro@@ wing business in its own foot , so my goal is to annually remove at least three do@@ zen paragraphs , which today only un@@ necessarily complic@@ ate the business , &quot; said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Ko@@ cou@@ re@@ k .
Eff@@ orts to abo@@ lish meaning@@ less regulations has rather positive load .
In 2007 most people were against the obligation of a business to report their intention to take part at the exhibition or fair with their stand three days ahead to the trade office at the place where its permanent establishment is located .
This has been removed by an amendment to the Trade Act .
The second most voted obligation in 2007 , which was reporting a business trip of foreign staff lasting up to 30 days to the Labour Office , was removed by the so-called Green Card Act .
And last but not least .
Ab@@ sur@@ dity of 2009 was the obligation of physi@@ o@@ therap@@ ists to have a large mirror , a refriger@@ ator and two step@@ ping sc@@ ales in the office .
It was mitig@@ ated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refriger@@ ator has been removed .
New category recogn@@ izes socially responsible companies
Environmental , humanitarian , educational and sports projects are considered .
New in the fifth year of H@@ N Da@@ ily competition is the category called the Respon@@ sible Company in 2010 .
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business .
&quot; We want this to support companies that reflect their business &quot; impact on the environment and encourage socially responsible activities , &quot; says Patri@@ k Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ dy , regional manager of Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one mobile operator company , which is the promot@@ er and guar@@ ant@@ or of the competition , as well as in the case of the re@@ bel competition .
In the first year of this special sub@@ category of the main Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one competition Company of the year 2010 , companies , for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal , signed for the competition .
Each story is very inspi@@ rational and would be enough for a separate article .
Although the nature of their activities varies considerably , the common denom@@ in@@ ator of their efforts may be the support and thou@@ ght@@ fulness .
In one case , for example , it relates to people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or health of their employees .
Among the four@@ teen fin@@ alists in CR we find a Pra@@ gu@@ e-@@ located software company E@@ t Ne@@ tera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of staff which then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports .
Another example of a responsible company from the Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce region is the company I@@ soli@@ t-@@ Bra@@ vo , who has been a major contribut@@ or to the en@@ dow@@ ment fund for handic@@ apped children for sevent@@ een years .
Old mill of Po@@ deb@@ ra@@ dy then takes care of their disabled employees , who are more than 70 percent of the whole staff , and was thus awarded with the title of Respon@@ sible Company in the Central Boh@@ em@@ ia Region and won the third place in the Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one competition Company of the year .
In the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region the award was received by Mi@@ Ry@@ z Soft accounting firm , which has introduced flexible working hours in addition to the reduced average 35 hours per week but did not reduce sal@@ ary proportion@@ ately .
The title was also awarded to the company because they prefer@@ ably buy from Czech manufacturers , promote civi@@ c activities in the neighborhood and protect the environment .
&quot; We try to recy@@ cle as much as possible so that our business and our administration had the least impact on the environment , &quot; explains the executive Mil@@ use Ry@@ zn@@ aro@@ v@@ á .
Respon@@ sible IT Company En@@ log@@ it in the Ú@@ st@@ í region then thinks about the health of its employees , and for each laptop purchased they bought ergonom@@ ic chairs and key@@ boards , support their work from home and use catering services provided by a local shel@@ tered workshop for their corporate events .
&quot; In addition , we support the People in Ne@@ ed Foundation , which helps the local Roma community in particular , &quot; says company representative On@@ dre@@ j Such@@ y .
Finally , worth no@@ ting is also the activity of P@@ ran@@ í a č@@ i@@ š@@ t@@ ě@@ n@@ í Company of the Kar@@ lo@@ vy V@@ ary region , which contributes its employees with bon@@ uses to their pension schemes .
&quot; We provide allow@@ an@@ ced for meals , transport , up@@ sk@@ illing and recreation , &quot; says Josef St@@ rap@@ á@@ č from Brun@@ t@@ á@@ l C@@ z@@ as@@ ch construction company , the winner in the Mor@@ avi@@ a@@ -S@@ ile@@ sian Region .
For the Respon@@ sible Company of the Year category were automatically en@@ rolled all regional fin@@ alists of Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one Company of the Year competition , who answered the question@@ n@@ aire attached to the application and sent it to organiz@@ ers until 15 August .
In@@ correctly filled or incomplete answers to the question@@ n@@ aire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiz@@ er .
&quot; If the representatives of competing companies failed to answer the questions , they could not attend the Respon@@ sible Company of the Year Competition , but are not dis@@ qualified from the &quot; main &quot; Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one competition Company of the Year . &quot;
&quot; Single sign just for this competition is not possible because it is a sub@@ category of the main competition Company of the year , &quot; explains Karel Gold@@ man of the organizing agency B@@ ison &amp; Rose .
Police made arre@@ sts at the Land Fund in Pl@@ zen during the ten@@ dering procedure
In recent days the anti-@@ corruption police made arre@@ sts at the building of the Land Fund in Pil@@ sen .
Hand@@ cu@@ ffs were put by dete@@ c@@ tives to a local entrepren@@ eur in the media sector and real estate dealer , Lu@@ bo@@ š G .
He alle@@ ge@@ dly attempted to manip@@ ulate the current tender for the settlement of re@@ stitution claims , so that the land offered was awarded to a particular candidate .
He was supposed to pay half a million to Lu@@ bo@@ š G .
So far I can only confirm that the police prosec@@ ute one person for the offen@@ se of frau@@ dul@@ ent manipulation of public procurement and public ten@@ ders , &quot; said the head of Pil@@ s@@ ner prosec@@ ution Ant@@ onie Z@@ el@@ en@@ á to Pra@@ vo , adding that the additional details with respect to ongoing investigations can not be released .
The 4@@ 6-@@ year-old entrepren@@ eur was released by police after 24 hours .
Due to a low of official information we can only spec@@ ulate how one could manip@@ ulate the tender .
A spo@@ kes@@ man of the Land Fund L@@ ub@@ om@@ í@@ ra Č@@ ern@@ á rep@@ lied to the question by Pra@@ vo that police actually made arre@@ sts at a deta@@ ched workplace in Pl@@ zen , namely during the public ten@@ dering procedure .
&quot; It was a client , not our employee , &quot; she said .
The public tender , according to M@@ s. C@@ ern@@ a , is called &quot; Inv@@ itation to tender for the transfer of land rights under the Land@@ s Act &quot; and takes place when more eligible candidates are interested in the land offered .
&quot; These people within the call offer a higher value of their re@@ stitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the announced value of the land . &quot;
&quot; By the claims offered the order of the acqu@@ ir@@ ers is set and Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims , &quot; said fund spo@@ kes@@ man .
Mr Lu@@ bo@@ š G. probably had information , who rep@@ lied to the call , and since he is also a benefici@@ ary , because he has bought a number of re@@ stitution claims , he suggested to another candidate not to participate .
The candidate probably received financial compensation .
That would explain that he was de@@ tained with such a large sum of money .
Lu@@ bo@@ s G had superior contacts to L@@ F already in the past .
He figu@@ red in the case of former chief of L@@ F Vac@@ la@@ v San@@ ko@@ t , who was prosec@@ uted for transferring lands in the sub@@ stitu@@ tional land re@@ stitution , on which a decision on the location of a building has already been issued .
It was just then when Mr Lu@@ bo@@ s G. acquired lands intended for the construction of public roads from the fund , particularly at the point where the dri@@ ve@@ way was to be built to the industrial zone Bor@@ ska p@@ ole .
Later , he very conveniently ex@@ changed those with the city for a house in the historic town center , which had a much higher value .
Town hall had to accept it then , because otherwise it would block the construction by blocking the lands .
H@@ ous@@ eholds will pay extra hundreds for housing a month
H@@ ous@@ eholds will have to pay more since January , not only for all types of energy , but also for water and se@@ wer@@ age , heating supplies , and r@@ ents will rise in certain areas .
Famili@@ es will have to pull out monthly hundreds more from pur@@ ses from January .
The price of electricity will be raised up by 4.@@ 6 percent ; gas will be about 2 percent more expensive , in some towns you will have to pay extra for water by up to a tent@@ h and supply of central heating will often be more expensive .
Electri@@ city price increase should cost hou@@ should s in the flat@@ s hundreds of cro@@ wns a year more than now .
Prices of power energy were reduced by all the major suppliers at the same time ; a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources , especially photo@@ volta@@ ics , is to blame then .
Although gas will only be slightly more expensive , it will happen when most people are heating their flat@@ s and thus have the highest consumption .
An@@ nu@@ ally they must then also take extra costs in account .
While electricity and gas will be more expensive across the country , central heating price change varies from place to place .
Price increase is planned mainly in larger municip@@ alities .
For example , households in Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ alo@@ ve will pay since January for central heating about C@@ Z@@ K 50 per month extra , families in Liber@@ ec will pay extra C@@ Z@@ K 1,000 a year .
Re@@ sidents of Prague may have more expensive water and se@@ wer by more than 9 percent , in the event that the city increases the rent of the infrastructure .
If the rent does not change , Prague residents will pay extra 6.@@ 8 percent .
Price in Prague , however , will still be in a nation@@ wide comparison rather low .
In the North Boh@@ em@@ ia , where prices are already among the highest , the water rate should increase by about 7.@@ 4 percent .
For example , the price of rent in 450 thousands of rental apartments , where regulation ends in January , may significantly increase .
For example , CP@@ I By@@ ty , which in U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m own@@ s about 2,@@ 500 apartments , plans to raise the rent from January by up to one hundred percent .
The company intends to bring to the court those who will not accept the new r@@ ents .
Regul@@ ated r@@ ents paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year .
Czech children get dr@@ un@@ k with Fer@@ net and R@@ um . Be@@ er is out of fashion , it works slowly .
Fer@@ net , rum , vo@@ d@@ ka , exceptionally better brand of wh@@ is@@ key st@@ olen from parents .
These are the drinks , after which most often dr@@ un@@ ks not even of the age of fifteen end in physi@@ cians &quot; care .
Children who are treated for dr@@ un@@ kenn@@ ess at the hospital repeatedly are not an exception .
This follows the experience of physi@@ cians who are confronted with similar cases in the ad@@ missions of patients to children departments of hospitals .
&quot; Be@@ er or wine is completely un@@ fashionable , as it takes a long time before they get dr@@ un@@ k . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ qu@@ or is the trend of today , that is for sure , &quot; said the head of children &apos;s ward in Hor@@ o@@ vice Hospital in central Boh@@ em@@ ia , Lu@@ de@@ k Pe@@ li@@ can to Pra@@ vo .
&quot; If they can pull out a bottle of their father from the clo@@ set , it is usually the wh@@ is@@ key , but otherwise Fer@@ net and vo@@ d@@ ka domin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; V@@ od@@ ka has the advantage that it is served in juice and they may not smell so badly then , &quot; said the head physi@@ cian .
And this is confirmed by the speaker of the Fac@@ ul@@ ty Hospital Mot@@ ol , E@@ va Jur@@ in@@ ov@@ á .
&quot; It is Fer@@ net or rum most often . &quot;
&quot; It is today a modern spirit , especially in primary schools . &quot;
&quot; In some cases , it was a pl@@ um brand@@ y , which they have brought from home , &quot; said Jur@@ in@@ ov@@ á .
According to the head physi@@ cian Pe@@ lik@@ án are thir@@ te@@ en- or four@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old drin@@ kers admitted to hospital a relatively common phenomenon .
Before Ho@@ ř@@ o@@ vice , where he has been since this year , he worked for ten years just in pedi@@ atri@@ cs department in Mot@@ ol , where amb@@ ul@@ ances bring befu@@ dd@@ led school@@ children from the surrounding area .
&quot; One girl was admitted to our hospital four times . &quot;
&quot; She started her career at the age of twelve , when she was brought to us with a 3.5 per mil@@ le of alcohol in the blood , in addition in combination with ec@@ stas@@ y , &quot; the doctor describes a particularly serious case .
&quot; She had attended a dance party and V@@ y@@ sta@@ vi@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; It is interesting that her mother did not find at all strange that she had not seen her daughter for 48 hours , &quot; said the chief physi@@ cian .
It is the dis@@ interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking problems of their own off@@ spring is considered a major cause of increasing children boo@@ zing .
It is however not an addi@@ ction in the true sense in the case of children according to experts .
&quot; Under the term alcoholi@@ c we understand a multi-@@ year chronic addi@@ ction to alcohol with all the related phenomena , which does not apply to children . &quot;
&quot; For those who use alcohol frequently , it is more associated with un@@ successful family-@@ social background , &quot; said the head physi@@ cian Pe@@ lik@@ an .
According to spo@@ kes@@ woman Jur@@ in@@ ov@@ á about for@@ ty dr@@ un@@ ken children have this year been hosp@@ itali@@ zed at the pedi@@ atri@@ c clin@@ ic in Mot@@ ol until mid-@@ November .
The statistics , however , receive only those with severe in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation who had to stay in the hospital .
Child dr@@ un@@ ks , who are taken home after out@@ patient treatment by their parents or the police , are not counted .
Exc@@ ept where kids just sit around after school and drink a bottle of brand@@ y , according to Pe@@ lik@@ an , there are three seasonal fluctu@@ ations , which one can rely on : Wit@@ ch Fe@@ ast , New Year and the end of the school year .
&quot; It &apos;s either to w@@ ash down the s@@ ad@@ ness from bad school report , conver@@ sely , to celebrate the start of the holiday . &quot;
&quot; But I experienced seven dr@@ un@@ k children admitted to hospital at the same time during the wi@@ tch fe@@ ast &quot; said Pe@@ lik@@ an .
The dr@@ un@@ k , who sp@@ ends the night with de@@ to@@ xi@@ fication under medical supervision , is parado@@ x@@ ically in an advantage compared to that one at home , who suff@@ ers from un@@ pleasant han@@ go@@ ver the next day .
Mor@@ ning head@@ aches caused by de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion and lack of glu@@ co@@ se are prevented by ir@@ ri@@ gation in@@ fusion with glu@@ co@@ se and nutri@@ ents that the body is lacking .
&quot; They are actually doing better because they have the beautiful evening experience and a good wake up when nothing hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Only they are confused about where they are , &quot; said Pe@@ lik@@ an , adding that he sometimes spo@@ ils the pleasant mood of the patients by at least a list of costs that their treatment required .
Transport by amb@@ ul@@ ance and being hosp@@ itali@@ zed on an acute bed costs thousands of cro@@ wns .
&quot; Sometimes I used this as an educational measure , when I directly to those children calculated how much it cost that they became dr@@ un@@ k , and that they could also spend the summer working to make money to cover this one party , &quot; said Pe@@ lik@@ an .
In@@ surance companies , however , do not take re@@ gression procedures in which the parents should cover the cost of treatment in cases of child dr@@ un@@ ks .
Two L-@@ 15@@ 9 air@@ crafts are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-@@ 15@@ 9 of a total of five pieces for which the Czech Def@@ ense Ministry has ex@@ changed transport aircraft C@@ ASA C-@@ 29@@ 5@@ M , fle@@ w on Tuesday to Seville , where is based the manufacturer of Casa air@@ crafts - EADS .
It is the first time that air@@ crafts of this type appeared in the possession of someone else than the Czech army .
They have only been abroad for training and demonstration flights .
It is a two-@@ seat version of the L-@@ 15@@ 9@@ T@@ 1 aircraft , which has been operated by Czech army and were air@@ worthy .
The remaining three are single-@@ L-@@ 15@@ 9 .
Those are still standing in A@@ ero Vo@@ do@@ cho@@ dy and the bro@@ ker - the company Om@@ ni@@ pol - took them over only last week .
It has not been released when the air@@ crafts will physi@@ cally leave Vo@@ do@@ cho@@ dy , according to Jan Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k of the Press Department of Ministry of Def@@ ense .
&quot; Sing@@ le-@@ seat L-@@ 15@@ 9 have been allocated for the exchange from long-@@ stored aircraft , and without any deposits and investments by the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wo@@ -@@ seat L-@@ 15@@ 9@@ T@@ 1 air@@ crafts were ex@@ changed in the current condition and form , &quot; Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k told Pra@@ vo .
He added that the army will not be left without a two-@@ seat aircraft , because in May 2009 the mini@@ stry signed a contract worth 200 million cro@@ wns with A@@ ero Vo@@ do@@ cho@@ dy for the reconstruction of four redundant L-@@ 15@@ 9 machines into two two-@@ seat machines .
One new aircraft was taken by the army in July ; the other will be taken over until the end of this year .
According to Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k EADS has committed to enforce the aircraft as equipment to some Alliance countries .
&quot; The contract clearly states that the purchaser of the L-@@ 15@@ 9 is the EADS company and they will be used for training pi@@ lots from NATO countries . &quot;
&quot; How to implement this thing is therefore an issue for customers &quot; said Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k .
Ho@@ spo@@ d@@ á@@ ř@@ sk@@ é nov@@ iny recently reported that the Spanish army is not interested in L-@@ 15@@ 9 .
The exchange of five L-@@ 15@@ 9 air@@ crafts for one Casa aircraft and purchase of three more air@@ crafts worth 3.5 billion was approved by government of Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ an@@ ek last year .
Ministry of Defence did not organize any tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly .
The former leadership of Ministry of Def@@ ense argued that the exchange would promote further exports of L-@@ 15@@ 9 abroad .
Czech Army has purchased 72 air@@ crafts from A@@ ero and uses only 24 ; they would like to sell the remaining ones .
Purch@@ ase of Casa air@@ crafts will probably have judicial implications .
The European Commission has su@@ ed the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court because the air@@ crafts were to be selected on the basis of a European tender and not addressing only one manufacturer .
The Army has already acquired three Casa air@@ crafts , the last one should arrive in Prague , airport K@@ b@@ ely , within a for@@ tn@@ i@@ ght .
Having index finger longer than ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index finger than ring finger are at lower risk of pro@@ state cancer .
It is a surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Canc@@ er .
This may be related to the level of the male hor@@ m@@ one te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
&quot; Our results show that the relative finger length may serve as a simple test for pro@@ state cancer risk , especially for a man up to 60 years , &quot; said study &apos;s co-@@ author R@@ os E@@ el@@ es , Professor at the Institute for Canc@@ er Research at the University of War@@ wick .
The finger could then help determine which men should under@@ go tests for pro@@ state cancer , particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden , she said .
In the period 199@@ 4-@@ 2009 she along with her colleagues monitored more than 1,@@ 500 patients with pro@@ state cancer in Britain and in parallel over three thousand healthy men .
More than a half of the study participants had a shorter index finger on their right hand than their ring finger .
The same prob@@ ability of pro@@ state cancer applied to them as for 19 percent of those whose f@@ ing@@ ers were of equal length .
For those who have the index finger longer than ring finger this risk decre@@ ased by 33 percent , while for men up to their six@@ ties it was even an 87 percent decline .
The ratio of the length of those two f@@ ing@@ ers - formed in the pren@@ at@@ al period - probably reflects different levels of sex hormon@@ es to which the child is exposed in the wom@@ b .
L@@ ess te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one corresponds to a longer index finger .
Pre@@ vious studies have shown that it is the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one that supports pro@@ state cancer development .
Le@@ ading gene@@ tic@@ ist and former Czech President of Academy of Sciences Professor Vac@@ la@@ v P@@ aces said for Č@@ T@@ K that he knows about the study but in his opinion the relationship between the length of the f@@ ing@@ ers and the cancer does not seem to be &quot; fully proven . &quot;
The Czech Republic is covered with snow , D@@ 1 and D@@ 5 are closed
Czech Republic , like most of Europe , wo@@ ke up covered in snow on Thursday morning .
The roads and p@@ av@@ ements are mostly covered with comp@@ acted snow , in many places road maintenance stuff dro@@ ve all night .
D@@ 5 between the 8@@ 9th and 9@@ 3rd kilom@@ eter in the direction of Ro@@ z@@ v@@ ado@@ v has been closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and D@@ 1 is also blocked in the direction from Br@@ no to Prague .
News were informed by the central dispat@@ cher of Autom@@ ot@@ ok@@ lub ( U@@ AM@@ K ) .
At the 9@@ 1st kilom@@ eter truck cra@@ shed , at the 9@@ 3rd kilom@@ eter two trucks col@@ li@@ ded , the accident included injury .
Also several cars ended up in a di@@ tch .
Problems are also on the D@@ 1 highway at the 18@@ 5th kilom@@ eter in the direction of Prague .
Two trucks have col@@ li@@ ded there .
Dri@@ vers should leave the highway just after Br@@ no at the 19@@ 0@@ th kilom@@ eter or go through Br@@ no and drive back to the highway at the 18@@ 2nd kilom@@ eter at K@@ ý@@ val@@ ka .
There are car qu@@ eu@@ es several kilometers long .
Also , there is an accident at D@@ 11 , at the very arrival in Prague .
There is a layer of snow , several cen@@ tim@@ eters thick , in Prague , the ther@@ mom@@ eter shows min@@ us seven degrees Cel@@ sius .
There are qu@@ eu@@ es of cars in Pro@@ se@@ k , Š@@ t@@ ě@@ r@@ b@@ oh@@ ol@@ ská is also blocked .
The most reliable means of transport is the subway .
Tra@@ ms run delayed between Charles Square and Nam@@ est@@ i Mir@@ u .
At eight in the morning Prague emergency staff should meet once again .
Also railways and airports must are facing the problems .
Czech Rail@@ ways have had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow .
There are problems with the railway line from Prague to Kr@@ al@@ up@@ y or from Prague to Ber@@ ou@@ n .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers should check the current situation .
Ru@@ zy@@ ne airport was closed from 11 pm Wednesday night to 5 a.m ..
Most of the roads in southern Mor@@ a@@ via are now pass@@ able , but only with caution .
There are three imp@@ ass@@ able side roads in the V@@ y@@ š@@ kov area , there is loads of snow in the Br@@ no area and snow chains are necessary for travelling on certain communications in higher parts of Blan@@ sko region .
The most affected sites included the V@@ y@@ sko@@ v area .
There are closed roads still : R@@ ous@@ í@@ no@@ v - S@@ lav@@ kov , Boh@@ dali@@ ce - Ku@@ č@@ ero@@ v and also Š@@ ar@@ ati@@ ce - Mi@@ le@@ š@@ o@@ vice .
For their extension rou@@ ters will be deployed .
It is impossible to estimate when they will be pass@@ able again .
In the Ho@@ don@@ in area , caution is necessary when travelling in the White Car@@ pa@@ thi@@ ans .
On roads that are there in order to protect the environment just kept pass@@ able with in@@ ert fill , there is a 5-@@ cen@@ tim@@ eter layer of snow , said Č@@ T@@ K .
In the Czech Republic from two to ten cen@@ tim@@ eters of snow has fallen , most in northern Boh@@ em@@ ia , often up to 18 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
In the Mor@@ avi@@ a@@ -S@@ ile@@ sian Region about 15 cen@@ tim@@ eters of snow has occurred .
Snow@@ fall in the Czech Republic gradually ce@@ ases .
American troops have a new &quot; smart weapon &quot;
The U.S. Army deployed a new &quot; smart weapon &quot; in Afghanistan , known so far only by a co@@ den@@ ame X@@ M-@@ 25 .
The gener@@ als hope that the new automatic ri@@ f@@ le will affect the conflict with the Taliban and &quot; change the game &quot; in their favor .
The new weapon is like a super@@ accurate small cann@@ on .
Their projec@@ tile is directed by a laser to hit within a few meters .
Special amm@@ uni@@ tion cali@@ ber 25 mm , designed for this ri@@ f@@ le and containing high explo@@ sive , in fact , act like little gr@@ en@@ ades .
The projec@@ tiles can be program@@ med to explo@@ de when hit@@ ting the target , but at any point of their bal@@ li@@ stic path .
They can be used against an enemy who is hi@@ ding behind a barrier , behind walls or in tren@@ ches .
These are usually not protected from the above , and if hit by the rain of dead@@ ly sh@@ ards of steel , they may not fight any more .
According to Richard Au@@ de@@ tta who participated in the development of X@@ M-@@ 25 ri@@ f@@ le , it is a new first weapon for the in@@ fan@@ try , which uses &quot; smart &quot; technology .
&quot; The soldi@@ er basically operates it as follows : they find a target , it sends a laser be@@ am to determine the distance and thus the precise explanation of the point , they adjust the elev@@ ation and squ@@ ee@@ ze the trigger . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s say that you have obtained 5@@ 43 meters . &quot;
&quot; When you squ@@ ee@@ ze the trigger , the gun charges , and fires a missi@@ le at a distance of 5@@ 43 meters plus or min@@ us one , two or three meters , &quot; said Au@@ de@@ tte .
400 jobs re@@ located
The Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su cor@@ poration is re@@ locating its Bad Hom@@ burg office to Frankfurt .
In July of next year , 400 employees will move from the current office building on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square in Bad Hom@@ burg to Frankfurt &apos;s A@@ stro Park .
The Japanese Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su cor@@ poration is re@@ locating its Bad Hom@@ burg office to Frankfurt .
The industry giant in computers and computer maintenance announced on Wednesday that 400 men and women are to move from the current office building on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square in Bad Hom@@ burg to Frankfurt &apos;s A@@ stro Park in July of next year . The A@@ stro Park is a large office complex on Lyon Street in Frankfurt &apos;s Nieder@@ rad district .
A spo@@ kes@@ woman for Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su explained that , in the medium term , a further 100 cor@@ poration employees currently spread across the region will join the Frankfurt office .
The rental offer had been extremely attractive and the open-@@ plan office in the A@@ stro Park was better suited to the way employees actually work , the spo@@ kes@@ woman added .
Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su had also only been r@@ enting the office in Bad Hom@@ burg .
The manager responsible for the move , Ber@@ nd Wag@@ ner , said , &quot; in Frankfurt Nieder@@ rad , we have found a central location with outstanding infrastructure . &quot;
The excellent connection to the airport was of particular significance to a global company such as Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su , he added .
Yesterday the coming re@@ location of an important company within the region was a cause for joy among the winners and disappointment among the lo@@ sers .
Markus Frank ( CD@@ U ) , head of Frankfurt &apos;s department of economic affairs , said the city had once again attracted a global player ,
which was a &quot; fantastic acknowled@@ gement of the city . &quot;
He believed the city would suit Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su and that the move would be a significant boost for Nieder@@ rad .
Michael Kor@@ wis@@ i ( Greens ) , Mayor of Bad Hom@@ burg , expressed his regret at Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su &apos;s decision .
He said the city had been informed of the intended move by the company &apos;s management board well in advance .
&quot; We offered the company our help , as a matter of course , &quot; said Kor@@ wis@@ i .
The am@@ ic@@ able meetings , however , had no effect on the difficulties between the computer manufacturer and the land@@ l@@ ord for the property on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square .
Economic reasons had finally ti@@ pped the balance .
Kor@@ wis@@ i now wants to focus on preventing such a prominent location from remaining vac@@ ant long-term .
&quot; I hope the building &apos;s owner and land@@ l@@ ord will cooperate . &quot;
The building previously used by Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su on the town hall square and the neighbouring low-@@ rise &quot; Kleine Ver@@ tik@@ ale &quot; were among a number of buildings on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square that were part of the controversial building project by the spa town ten years ago .
The joint project between the city and a private project developer served to create a new entrance into the city between the train station and town hall , which attracted criticism on account of the massive scale of development over areas previously partly used for parking , and on account of the height of the buildings .
In 2001 , three companies moved in : Fer@@ i , the investment consultancy management and rating company , Start Ama@@ de@@ us , the travel sales and marketing systems software manufacturer , and Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su , the computer maker ( still linked to Siemens at the time ) .
The buildings used by Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfur@@ t-@@ based DI@@ C Group and the Morgan Stan@@ ley Real Estate Fund and sold on to Spanish Fal@@ con Real Estate Invest@@ ments SA in Madrid one year later .
The Tok@@ yo@@ -based Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su cor@@ poration s@@ ells itself as the third largest IT provider in the world .
It provides companies with computers , servers and other equipment and provides necessary servi@@ cing .
The office in the Rhein@@ -@@ Main area is one of the largest in Germany , although Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su has considerably more employees in Munich .
The Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su subsidiary , Technology Solutions , is also moving from Bad Hom@@ burg to Frankfurt ; two further subsidiaries , Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su Services and a company named T@@ DS , will also be based in Frankfurt .
7@@ 000 square metres have been r@@ ented in the A@@ stro Park office building to accommodate them .
The twenty-@@ year-old complex - its name inspired by the star@@ -@@ shaped ground plan - is already home to the Central Association of the German Electri@@ cal and Electronics Industry ( Z@@ V@@ E@@ I ) and other organisations .
Ama@@ zon blocks server - threats against Ass@@ ange
Wiki@@ le@@ aks is getting into deeper and deeper waters .
The e-@@ commerce company Ama@@ zon has banned the whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer from its servers .
Political pressure may stand behind the move following publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispat@@ ches .
The founder of Wiki@@ le@@ aks , Ass@@ ange , is believed to be in England .
The whi@@ stle b@@ lowing website , Wiki@@ le@@ aks , is increasingly under fire in the United States .
Internet activists have lost access to their American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe .
The prominent American Sen@@ ator Jo@@ e Lie@@ ber@@ man called upon other countries and companies to boy@@ cot@@ t Wiki@@ le@@ aks .
In the meantime , a newspaper report suggests Wiki@@ le@@ aks founder Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange , who is on Inter@@ pol &apos;s wanted list , is currently in Great Britain .
&quot; Wiki@@ le@@ aks forced off Ama@@ zon servers . &quot;
&quot; Free speech in the land of the free , &quot; said the whi@@ stle b@@ lowing activists on Wednesday ( local time ) via the Twitter mess@@ aging service .
A short while previously , the internet company Ama@@ zon had banned Wiki@@ le@@ aks documents from its servers .
The internet activists had used the Ama@@ zon Web Service ( A@@ WS ) to publish secret diplomatic dispat@@ ches in order to be able to cope with the high number of people accessing the documents .
Wiki@@ le@@ aks discussed the step on Twitter : &quot; Great - we &apos;ll spend our dollars emplo@@ ying people in Europe instead . &quot;
If Ama@@ zon had issues with freedom of speech , &quot; it should give up selling books . &quot;
Ama@@ zon stopped Wiki@@ le@@ aks using its servers after colleagues of Sen@@ ator Jo@@ e Lie@@ ber@@ man started to investigate , reported the broad@@ cast@@ er CN@@ N , quot@@ ing Lie@@ ber@@ man &apos;s office .
The chairman of the Sen@@ ate Committee on Hom@@ eland Security and Govern@@ mental Affairs had threatened to boy@@ cot@@ t Ama@@ zon , reported the British newspaper &quot; The Gu@@ ardi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; I would have liked to see Ama@@ zon take this step earlier , considering the previous publication of classified information by Wiki@@ le@@ aks , &quot; said the Sen@@ ator .
Lie@@ ber@@ man also called on other countries to cooperate in preventing Wiki@@ le@@ aks from finding new servers .
&quot; Wiki@@ le@@ aks &quot; illegal , ou@@ trage@@ ous , and reck@@ less acts have com@@ promised our national security and put lives at risk around the world , &quot; the non-@@ party Sen@@ ator stated in a statement .
&quot; No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should assist Wiki@@ le@@ aks in its efforts to dis@@ semin@@ ate these st@@ olen materials . &quot;
Wiki@@ le@@ aks founder Ass@@ ange , who is wanted by Swedish authority on suspi@@ cion of rap@@ e , is on Inter@@ pol &apos;s wanted list .
According to a report in the Lon@@ d@@ on-@@ based newspaper &quot; The Independent , &quot; the 3@@ 9-@@ year-old Australian is currently in the UK , and Scotland Y@@ ard is aware of his exact location .
The internet activ@@ ist has always described the Swedish investigations as a scheme orchest@@ rated by his de@@ trac@@ tors .
In London , Wiki@@ le@@ aks spo@@ kes@@ man Kri@@ st@@ inn H@@ ra@@ f@@ n@@ sson said that threats had been made .
&quot; There have even been calls to assass@@ inate Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange . &quot;
H@@ ra@@ f@@ n@@ sson said that Ass@@ ange was therefore afraid for his personal safety .
The Wiki@@ le@@ aks founder will remain in hi@@ ding .
H@@ ra@@ f@@ n@@ sson was clearly re@@ acting to statements from North America .
In America , the former Republi@@ can Govern@@ or of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , had called for the people responsible for the Wiki@@ le@@ aks re@@ vel@@ ations to be indi@@ cted and executed for treas@@ on .
In Canada , one of Prime Minister Stephen Har@@ per &apos;s advis@@ ers ir@@ on@@ ically suggested on television that Ass@@ ange should be &quot; killed &quot; and that Obama could &quot; use a dr@@ one . &quot;
In the meantime , exchanges have been made between the White House and Ass@@ ange .
Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs , the speaker of American President Barack Obama , said that it was &quot; ridicul@@ ous and absurd &quot; that Ass@@ ange had demanded the re@@ sign@@ ation of Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton if she is found responsible for recently revealed requests to diplom@@ ats to engage in es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
&quot; I &apos;m not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website , &quot; said Gi@@ b@@ bs .
&quot; Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far stronger than his one website . &quot;
The American government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the security of its databases .
Rus@@ sell Tra@@ vers , Dep@@ uty Director of the Information Division at the National Anti-@@ Terror@@ ism Centre , has been appointed as a special representative , the White House announced .
Tra@@ vers will be responsible for developing the &quot; necessary structural reforms &quot; that are now needed following the dis@@ closure of diplomatic dispat@@ ches by Wiki@@ le@@ aks .
The White House also wants to look at how the entire government exchanges and protects information .
The American government also expressed its concern for the safety of dis@@ sidents and activists who may be put at risk by the Wiki@@ le@@ aks publication .
&quot; We have done everything to contact them , &quot; said States Department Spo@@ kes@@ man Phili@@ p Cro@@ wle@@ y .
&quot; We are ready to protect them if that becomes necessary . &quot;
The I@@ ce Cre@@ am University
I@@ ce cream conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ers are being trained for the warm seasons at the &quot; Gel@@ ato University &quot; in Bologna .
The three-@@ day foundation course for future &quot; gel@@ ati@@ eri &quot; is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the world .
Where does all that ice cream actually come from ?
From the &quot; gel@@ ati@@ ere &quot; and the &quot; gel@@ at@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
The &quot; gel@@ ati@@ ere , &quot; known in English as the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned &quot; ice cream conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ er , &quot; produces the cream following the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making .
The &quot; gel@@ at@@ ai@@ o &quot; gets the ice cream out of the refriger@@ ated counter with a sp@@ at@@ ula , smoo@@ thes it into w@@ af@@ ers and s@@ ells it .
You do not need to go to An@@ z@@ ola dell &apos;@@ Em@@ ilia in the province of Bologna to know that .
But for anyone who wants to know more about ice cream , the &quot; Gel@@ ato University &quot; of the Italian Car@@ pi@@ gi@@ ani company is a must .
The ice cream university was created by the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from all its makers met exac@@ ting Italian standards .
The three-@@ day foundation course for future &quot; gel@@ ati@@ eri &quot; is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the world .
There are also specialised courses over several days covering chocolate ice cream , and intern@@ ships in the company &apos;s own ice cream parl@@ our .
Many dream of a new career to escape a mid-@@ life crisis ; others come to test their vague aspirations against the cold facts .
This time , there are 40 participants from 19 countries and every continent - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia .
Jack@@ y , an art teacher from California , lo@@ ves the slow food movement and wants to offer a high-quality European product in a country accu@@ stom@@ ed to industrial ice cream .
An@@ ke from Berlin is a management consul@@ tant and wants to do something on her own after years in a highly stres@@ s@@ ful job .
Two young Egyptian girls dream of opening an ice cream parl@@ our in Cairo .
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian hou@@ se@@ wife Ju@@ lia has come because her children love Italian ice cream .
Ma@@ estro gel@@ ati@@ ere Lu@@ ciano Ferrari begins the course by descri@@ bing the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream .
Not only a good flav@@ our , but sil@@ ky sof@@ tness and good tex@@ ture are key .
Training the course , Lu@@ ciano does not forget to mention the real ic@@ ing on the ca@@ ke for the national and thoroughly southern mono@@ li@@ th . &quot; Italian gel@@ ato is simply the best - after that , it &apos;s all just roman@@ ce . &quot;
The first step of production seems very easy .
Lu@@ ciano p@@ ours the basic ingredients - milk , cream , pow@@ dered milk , sugar and stabili@@ sers - into a large blen@@ der that he@@ ats the mixture to 85 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately co@@ ols it to four degrees .
Then he turns a tap on the machine and out comes a past@@ eur@@ ised , basic white ice cream , the basic for all mil@@ k-@@ based ice cre@@ ams .
The lec@@ tur@@ er is immediately overwhel@@ med by questions . Can you make ice cream using natural ingredients only without stabili@@ sers ?
How can you experiment freely on your own ?
Lu@@ ciano war@@ ns against letting the spirit of the age lead you ast@@ ray .
Anyone who talks about making ice cream &quot; using natural ingredients only &quot; has probably used stabili@@ sers anyway - in most cases a natural product such as gu@@ ar g@@ um from gu@@ ar be@@ ans .
Of course , you can make ice cream without stabili@@ sers , but then you have to sell it within a day , as otherwise it collap@@ ses and your customer ends up li@@ cking l@@ umps of ice .
Some variations to the base are allowed .
It gets more exciting with the flav@@ ours .
For ice cream flav@@ ouring , Ma@@ estro Lu@@ ciano differenti@@ ates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section and in the sweet section of the super@@ market .
There are also pow@@ ders and past@@ es .
&quot; All suppliers will try to get you to get you to buy doz@@ ens of flav@@ oured additives .
But you should just experiment . &quot;
Ei@@ ther with fruit sor@@ bets using sugar and fresh fruits ,
or with a white ice cream base that can be turned into yellow cream by using eggs or can be mixed with co@@ coa powder to form the base of all kinds of se@@ duc@@ tive chocolate .
At last the course participants are allowed onto the ice cream maker .
Lu@@ ciano lets each of them make four different types of van@@ illa , chocolate , mo@@ cha and ha@@ zel@@ n@@ ut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base and with more or less van@@ illa flav@@ ouring or other natural ingredients .
The experiment is repeated with the range of fruit sor@@ bets .
More flav@@ our@@ ings , more fruit pur@@ ée - not necessarily an improvement in taste .
Ha@@ zel@@ n@@ ut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nut@@ ty when it contains more ha@@ zel@@ nu@@ ts .
The team that produces the most popular ki@@ w@@ i ice cream uses more fruit , less water and a little less of the stabili@@ ser .
The taste of a gel@@ ato only really stands out if the mixture is balanced , says Lu@@ ciano .
Making ice cream is a matter of ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic . If sug@@ ary pe@@ ach pur@@ ée is used , the proportion of sugar in the basic recip@@ e has to be reduced .
An extra portion of sugar is needed for le@@ mon ice cream .
Lu@@ ciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of fruit ( vin@@ tn@@ ers use it to measure the density of gra@@ pe must using the O@@ ech@@ s@@ le scale ) .
Fortunately , tables make the calculations easier .
Making ice cream does not require as much physical activity as it once did .
It is not just the machine , which produces the base .
There is also a device that be@@ ats the finished ice cream mixture to a cre@@ am@@ y consistency while cooling it to negative temperatures .
But despite all automation , minor accidents still occur .
The Brazilian Gu@@ sta@@ vo covers himself and his course m@@ ates from head to to@@ e with fruit pur@@ ée as he loses control of the over@@ sized hand-@@ held blen@@ der .
&quot; In every course , &quot; says Ma@@ estro Lu@@ ciano , &quot; it is only a matter of time before something like this happens . &quot;
In@@ spec@@ tors in the twi@@ light
There are alleg@@ ations that the European Food Safety Authority ( EF@@ SA ) has been in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by the genetically modified crop industry .
The Test@@ bio@@ tech centre of expertise , which sees itself as an independent institute for assessing the impact of biotechnology , has made the accus@@ ation .
&quot; It sounds like a con@@ spi@@ racy theory , but we have good documentary evidence , &quot; said head of Test@@ bio@@ tech , Christoph Then , in Munich on Wednesday .
Harry Ku@@ i@@ per , chair of EF@@ SA &apos;s expert panel responsible for the risk assessment of genetically engine@@ ered plants and another EF@@ SA expert are also believed to have been working with the lobby group IL@@ SI for years .
IL@@ SI receives funds from corporations such as Mon@@ san@@ to , N@@ est@@ le and Ba@@ yer .
Ku@@ i@@ per has had a central role in developing the EF@@ SA test specifications for GM plants and therefore has a clear conflict of interests , says Then .
In places , the EF@@ SA regulations are identical to position papers produced by IL@@ SI and thus are being written by the very industry that the authority , based in the Italian city of Par@@ ma , should be controlling , argu@@ es Then ,
pointing out that this is the second time Test@@ bio@@ tech has criticised a conflict of interests .
A high-@@ ranking EF@@ SA manager recently moved to the Swiss agri@@ business company Syn@@ gent@@ a without any restrictions or a transitional period being imposed , and is now on the other side of the line .
M@@ DR Radio has also recently un@@ covered personal connections between the EU supervisory authority and the industry lobby , which has caught the attention of the Environment Agency and EU parliament@@ arians .
However , EF@@ SA does not see any conflict of interests .
In a statement , EF@@ SA said that all significant data were considered , including data from industry , if such data were of a high professional quality .
In addition , EF@@ SA stated that it had no requirement that its panels avoid all contact with industry .
However , all members of EF@@ SA must dis@@ close any such contact .
Ku@@ i@@ per ad@@ mits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute ( IL@@ SI ) in the USA .
The institute describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science , industry and politics to assess the risks around biotechnology and other areas - without a lob@@ b@@ ying mandate .
In this field , independent experts such as Then express criticism that genetically modified plants are currently approved for animals without feeding trials and that the reaction of GM plants to environmental influences is not being investigated .
&quot; For example , we want to know what genetically modified cor@@ n does in fields , &quot; says Then .
Cur@@ rent practice is only to test isolated prot@@ eins , but not the entire GM plant , which does not provide reliable results .
&quot; If you don &apos;t look for the risks , how are you supposed to find them ? , &quot; asks Then .
Ange@@ li@@ ka Hil@@ beck shares his opinion .
The scienti@@ st has been carrying out research into GM technology since 1994 and is currently working at ET@@ H Zurich .
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or dis@@ credit outs@@ po@@ ken@@ ly critical scientists in this field in Europe , as in the USA , says Hil@@ beck .
There are hardly any researchers left without ties to corporations , she believes ,
and studies critic@@ ising companies are not normally published .
&quot; The industry is controlling safety research , &quot; says Hil@@ beck .
The trail of stones
Ul@@ i G@@ sell has got hold of some - in total , around 400 ki@@ los .
On Monday evening , he was standing in front of Stuttgart train station , his tu@@ ba on his back .
There was a demonstration .
It was sno@@ wing .
The tale is a familiar one . In September , the excav@@ ators arrived and had begun to break up a large section of the north wing .
Stuttgart was not the same . Th@@ ous@@ ands and thousands of people demonstrated against S@@ 21 , the multi-@@ billion Euro sin@@ king of the train station .
By the time work was suspended , a large proportion of the wing was rub@@ ble .
Bro@@ ken into 6@@ 000 or 7@@ 000 pieces .
C@@ rail@@ sh@@ ei@@ m shell li@@ me@@ stone , a cru@@ mb@@ ly co@@ ar@@ se stone , qu@@ arri@@ ed between 19@@ 14 and 1920 .
4@@ 3-@@ year-old G@@ sell is a sculp@@ tor in Ost@@ fil@@ dern .
He got hold of a few ch@@ un@@ ks .
&quot; These stones are re@@ lic@@ s . &quot;
&quot; They will not disappear . &quot;
He ra@@ ves : &quot; A cheap and poor stone , simple and ear@@ thy . &quot;
When he cut one out , it sm@@ elt of cigare@@ tte f@@ umes .
He still does not know what he will do with the ch@@ un@@ ks of stone .
St@@ ones have plenty of time .
As does Ul@@ i G@@ sell .
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in T@@ ü@@ bin@@ gen and a former French m@@ uni@@ tions de@@ pot where Manuel Ron@@ gen has created his own world of stone .
The 4@@ 4-@@ year-old tra@@ des in old stones .
He has bought every stone from the demo@@ li@@ tion in Stuttgart .
&quot; It would be a crime if they were ground into gra@@ vel or disappeared into land@@ fill , &quot; he says in his office , a small wooden sh@@ ack that was once a sent@@ ry box .
People insul@@ ted and threatened him , he rec@@ alls , when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demo@@ li@@ tion contrac@@ tor .
He talked with the opponents of the Stuttgart 21 development project for days on end .
He explained that there was nothing he could do about the demo@@ li@@ tion .
And if it were going to happen , then the most sensible thing was that the stones were used again for other purposes .
In response , around 200 Stuttgart 21 opponents took a block away with them , each weigh@@ ing an average of 80 ki@@ los and co@@ sting 6.@@ 50 to 14 Euros .
Some as a keep@@ sake , but others in the hope of being able to return the blocks if the building is re@@ built .
Ron@@ gen had bought 500 tonnes - equivalent to 25 tru@@ ck-@@ loads .
About half is stored in the forest , but the rest has been sold long ago .
Gar@@ den@@ ers , landscape gar@@ den@@ ers and home@@ owners .
They came from everywhere and took away whatever they could carry in car bo@@ ots and tra@@ ilers .
The Stuttgart stones of scandal have long since been transformed into walls , or boundaries for her@@ b gardens .
&quot; Ac@@ tually , this stone is nothing special , &quot; says Ron@@ gen .
&quot; If it didn &apos;t have political significance . &quot;
He clim@@ bs into his off-@@ ro@@ ader and does a tour of his realm of 20 hectares .
He studied law but swit@@ ched to bi@@ ology , then he got interested in computers , and finally became a stone mer@@ chant .
And a stone enthusi@@ ast .
He stores 40@@ ,000 tonnes of stone .
He car@@ ts his treas@@ ure from all over Germany .
And claims to be the largest used stone dealer in the country .
He bra@@ kes .
Art@@ fully car@@ ved sand@@ stones are lying in the snow .
&quot; They used to be part of Dresden &apos;s Mari@@ en@@ brücke , &quot; he says .
El@@ be sand@@ stone , yellow and warm , he says .
&quot; My favourite stone . &quot;
The route then continues up@@ wards through the forest .
He points to a pi@@ le : red sand@@ stone , previously part of Karlsruhe train station .
And more .
&quot; Beautiful tra@@ ver@@ t@@ ine . &quot;
The blocks once belon@@ ged to the stands of Stuttgart &apos;s N@@ eck@@ ar stadium .
The snow is full of stones and stories - Stuttgart tra@@ ver@@ t@@ ine from Stuttgart police headquarters , red gran@@ ite from Dom St. Bla@@ sius , tu@@ ff from Heil@@ brun@@ n hospital .
So much work , so much effort , so much swe@@ at .
When Ron@@ gen thinks about how the stones used to be car@@ ved by hand and moved with simply pul@@ le@@ ys and ox@@ car@@ ts , he feels a great sense of rever@@ ence .
&quot; It would be a scandal to sh@@ red all this . &quot;
He has@@ n &apos;t become rich , but he has found some pri@@ cel@@ ess stones .
The stone mer@@ chant currently emplo@@ ys 14 people and mas@@ ons , sculp@@ tors , a s@@ mith , a glass blo@@ wer and a hor@@ ticul@@ tur@@ ist have also set up in the forest .
&quot; We work hard , but it is satis@@ fying , &quot; says the used stone dealer .
He has to go to Cologne soon .
There are stones to be rescu@@ ed there as well .
Tal@@ ent war for gradu@@ ates with potential
There is a rus@@ h on at the buffet .
16 students are sho@@ ving their way to sal@@ mon roll@@ s , tom@@ ato sou@@ p and desert .
The Technical University of Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g and the car maker Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop .
They are going talk shop on the car of the future with V@@ W developers in a kind of idea contest - and , inci@@ dentally , find out more about Volkswagen .
Many companies are already engaged in hand-@@ to-@@ hand combat in the contest for the cle@@ ver@@ est minds , and are rel@@ ying on cooperation with universities , just like V@@ W .
Their mission : to recru@@ it the most tal@@ ented gradu@@ ates as early as possible in the lec@@ ture hall - before they come onto the job market and are cour@@ ted by anyone else .
And because universities do not provide a break@@ down of student performance , companies are looking for and hoping to attract exceptional talent in hand@@ s-@@ on projects .
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g , the car maker it out to wo@@ o the talent .
A young woman from human resources distri@@ butes ball@@ point p@@ ens , gum@@ my bears and fol@@ ders bearing the V@@ W logo .
She tells the young hop@@ e@@ ful@@ s about intern@@ ships and student jobs , and explains the various routes into the company .
N@@ ico S@@ elle from the Technical University of Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g is managing the project with V@@ W .
He sees advantages for both sides . &quot; The students get in contact with industry and gain some experience . &quot;
&quot; V@@ W can get to know students while taking a closer look at interesting candidates and thinking about which ones are their potential employees . &quot;
Such cooperation , thinks S@@ ells , is not unusual .
What is new is that students are being tou@@ ted so aggressi@@ vely .
&quot; The focus used to be on speciali@@ sm@@ -@@ specific projects , &quot; says S@@ elle .
The fight for the latest bat@@ ch of gradu@@ ates is set to be a lot tou@@ gher .
In many sectors , companies can no longer identify their employees from the ho@@ ards of applicants .
They really have to sell themselves to win over highly qualified gradu@@ ates .
Gra@@ du@@ ates in engineering find themselves particularly well placed for negotiation .
According to the Association of German Engine@@ ers ( V@@ DI ) , more than 40@@ ,000 engineering jobs were un@@ filled in October .
And the shortage of engineers is going to get worse , according to V@@ DI .
Roman Dy@@ kt@@ a is on the hun@@ t for talent for K@@ PM@@ G , the audit , tax and advisory services firm .
He organis@@ es lav@@ ish recruitment events such as the K@@ PM@@ G race , a kind of modern sc@@ av@@ enger hun@@ t where participants have to find their route using GPS coordin@@ ates .
The company wants to send eight promising students straight across the USA next year .
And quite inci@@ dentally , the participants will see K@@ PM@@ G branches and get to know the company .
Who gets to go is decided in two advance selection rounds .
Only the cr@@ ème de la cr@@ ème of the many applicants will fly to the USA .
A@@ midst all the war cri@@ es surrounding university gradu@@ ates with potential , the ri@@ f@@ le shots from some companies are getting lou@@ der and lou@@ der , says Dy@@ kt@@ a .
&quot; With this race , we want to stand out from the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Just one trip wasn &apos;t enough for us . &quot;
For tal@@ ent-@@ h@@ unter Dy@@ kt@@ a , the sums add up .
&quot; To this day , we have stayed in contact with all the participants of a similar campaign last year . &quot;
&quot; Some of them are just about to graduate and expect to apply to us soon , &quot; he says .
Besides direct tou@@ ting on camp@@ us , small and medium-sized businesses especially are stal@@ king candidates at classic career fairs .
&quot; We try to reach gradu@@ ates at fairs . &quot;
&quot; For example , at Inter@@ solar , &quot; says Si@@ tha St@@ ü@@ be , head of human resources at the solar technology manufacturer , Solar@@ world .
The B@@ onn@@ -based company emplo@@ ys around 1500 people in Germany .
St@@ ü@@ be is well aware of the problem of attrac@@ ting young talent .
There are currently 35 vac@@ ancies on the company website .
&quot; It is really very difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions . &quot;
&quot; It costs a lot of time and money , &quot; she says .
Another route is contact via university lec@@ tur@@ ers .
Solar@@ world is co@@ operating with a number of universities , including Frei@@ berg University .
&quot; The lec@@ tur@@ ers point out that the students can do intern@@ ships or write their dis@@ ser@@ tations with us . &quot;
Ex@@ pen@@ sive advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not in the pipeline .
On the other hand , the company is trying to adverti@@ se with its other advantages , including a relaxed working atmosphere , flat hierarch@@ ies and straightforward communication .
&quot; A big cor@@ poration cannot often offer that , &quot; says human resources manager St@@ ü@@ be .
Money has not been the key factor in the job market for a while .
Flexi@@ ble working time , child@@ care and good promotion opportunities are also decisive factors .
Solar@@ world came in 5@@ 5th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute .
The institute publi@@ shes an annual le@@ ague table of German employers .
It asks employees how happy they are with their work and job environment and looks at the general working conditions .
Human resources manager St@@ ü@@ be hopes to score points with j@@ ob@@ -@@ seekers thanks to the company &apos;s place on the list .
&quot; I think that applicants are influenced strongly by external assessments of any potential emplo@@ yer , &quot; she says .
Wolf R@@ einer Krieg@@ ler from the German Emplo@@ yer Br@@ anding Academy is an advis@@ or for companies seeking to develop a reputation as a good emplo@@ yer as part of a long-term strategy .
He adv@@ ises his clients to be more authentic .
And that actually means internal changes , says Krieg@@ ler .
&quot; The best way to make yourself attractive as an emplo@@ yer is via your own employees , &quot; he says .
In industry jar@@ gon , that means Emplo@@ yer Br@@ anding among your own employees .
&quot; Happ@@ y employees are the best amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
If you treat your own well and they identify with the company , then they will find you new employees among their friends and acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; It &apos;s like playing in a band , &quot; says Krieg@@ ler .
Obama stops new oil dri@@ lling
There will be no new dri@@ lling off the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming year .
The government in Washington has published a prohi@@ bition to that effect - thereby definiti@@ vely scra@@ pping earlier plans .
New dri@@ lling is also forbidden off the Atlantic coast for the immediate future .
Secretary of the Inter@@ ior K@@ en Sal@@ az@@ ar made the announcement on Wednesday .
The explosion of the De@@ ep@@ water Horiz@@ on dri@@ lling platform in April was the trigger for the strict prohi@@ bition , which is to remain in force for at least the next five years .
Before the disaster that cost ele@@ ven workers their lives and led to the USA &apos;s biggest environmental disaster , President Barack Obama , under pressure from the opposition and industry , had sign@@ alled his read@@ iness to allow new dri@@ lling in the eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ad@@ vo@@ cators had hoped this would reduce the USA &apos;s dependency on foreign oil supplies .
Who will bear responsibility for the devastating oil sp@@ ill in the Gulf has still not been conclu@@ sively decided .
The British energy company B@@ P is the focus of criticism , and is faced with claims for billions of dollars .
A board of inquiry set up by President Obama is set to submit its findings at some point in December .
In October , Secretary of the Inter@@ ior K@@ en Sal@@ az@@ ar had re@@ vo@@ ked the prohi@@ bition on dri@@ lling imposed after the explosion .
In response , various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new dri@@ lling projects .
Obama and Sal@@ az@@ ar want to rule out any further catastrop@@ he with tou@@ gher controls and stricter safety regulations .
The responsible control authority , which fell into dis@@ rep@@ ute after numerous accus@@ ations of corruption , is being exten@@ sively reformed .
At the same time , the President has announced that lu@@ cra@@ tive tax lo@@ op@@ holes for oil and gas companies will be stopped .
The industry is warning publicly that the output in the Gulf will be significantly lower than in the past if regulation is tou@@ gher .
&quot; The government &apos;s plans are the biggest bra@@ ke on the growth of the oil and gas industry , &quot; is the outcome of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm B@@ DO - even before the prohi@@ bition on dri@@ lling was put in place on Wednesday .
The American Energy Alliance also compla@@ ins of the uncertainty faced by the industry . &quot; No one knows what exactly will change in terms of regulation . &quot;
The organisation believes investment in new projects will be suspended in@@ definitely - at the expense of growth .
O@@ gon@@ il@@ and has bur@@ nt down
The water in the rivers is o@@ il-@@ brown and re@@ eks like a pet@@ rol station . Billi@@ ons of lit@@ res of le@@ aked cru@@ de oil have destroyed the natural environment of O@@ gon@@ il@@ and in Nigeria .
People are living on the@@ ft , corruption and cooking illegal oil .
Cel@@ est@@ ine Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i sees the positive side .
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , &quot; the eco@@ activ@@ ist tells journalists . &quot; You &apos;ll see plenty of oil s@@ lu@@ dge to photogra@@ ph today . &quot;
The 3@@ 7-@@ year-old Nig@@ eri@@ an was trying to photogra@@ ph a boy w@@ ading up to his wa@@ ist in the water - and the stre@@ aks of water around him . In the rain@@ bo@@ w-@@ coloured water , the scene is almost beautiful .
The brown bil@@ lows of cru@@ de oil under the surface are in@@ visible .
Es@@ ther Bad@@ om used to fill bu@@ ckets with sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s at the bank of the Bo@@ do jet@@ ty river .
Now , the stag@@ n@@ ant waters are completely dead .
Five years ago , massive quantities of cru@@ de oil floo@@ ded out of a bur@@ st oil pipeline into the vast wet@@ land .
Fisher@@ men from the nearby town of Bo@@ do now have to p@@ add@@ le six hours to get to water inhab@@ ited by fish . O@@ gon@@ il@@ and , in the heart of the N@@ iger del@@ ta , is one of the most contam@@ inated regions in the world .
On the journey through the man@@ gro@@ ve sw@@ amp@@ s , cris@@ s-@@ cro@@ ssed by river courses , the full extent of the dev@@ ast@@ ation is plain to see .
Instead of clear water , the motor@@ boat chur@@ ns up a brown s@@ will ; if you put your hand in the water it comes out co@@ ated in oil .
The roots of the man@@ gro@@ ve trees stick out from the ground like black li@@ qu@@ ori@@ ce sti@@ cks . The od@@ d pal@@ m among the man@@ gro@@ ves han@@ gs its fron@@ d des@@ pon@@ dently .
The flo@@ cks of birds ub@@ i@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in wet@@ lands are no@@ where to be seen . As soon as the out@@ board motor falls silent , a devastating quiet desc@@ ends over the former paradise that now st@@ in@@ ks like a pet@@ rol station .
&quot; What is happening here is ecological war@@ fare , &quot; says Cel@@ est@@ ine Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i , som@@ bre@@ ly . &quot; We are living with a permanent haz@@ ard to health . &quot;
The comparison to war is ap@@ posite .
The region of the O@@ g@@ oni has been a con@@ tested batt@@ le@@ field for decades . More than 60 years ago , the first expl@@ or@@ ers from Europe made their way to the region . In the 8@@ 0s , the first wave of resistance was organised around the author K@@ en S@@ aro@@ -@@ Wi@@ wa , who was later executed . It was here that the S@@ hell company had to stop production in 1993 , because it was too dangerous for its oil workers .
Even today , the company is prohibited from returning to O@@ gon@@ il@@ and . While more than two million bar@@ rel@@ s of black gold are p@@ ump@@ ed every day from the del@@ ta region as a whole - which is an area three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5000 well@@ s and 7@@ 000 kilometres of pipeline - the o@@ il@@ fields in O@@ gon@@ il@@ and lie f@@ allow , the situation too unstable for the oil company .
Every few hundred metres , steel frames rise from the water like bizarre sculp@@ tures . The heads of bo@@ re@@ holes are far too affec@@ tion@@ ately referred to as &quot; little Christmas trees . &quot;
These structures can be up to 50 years old and most of them are seriously cor@@ ro@@ ded .
One bo@@ re@@ hole after the next falls apart , says Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i , then a constant stream of cru@@ de oil runs into the water .
According to expert estimates , more than two billion lit@@ res have flo@@ wn into the del@@ ta &apos;s eco@@ system in 50 years . Year on year , that is the same amount of oil that rus@@ hed into the sea off Al@@ as@@ ka when the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez super@@ tan@@ ker cra@@ shed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrop@@ hes in human history .
There is dispute over who should be held responsible for the ongoing worst case scenario of ecological disaster .
Whilst the S@@ hell company says sab@@ ot@@ age and organised the@@ ft of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of the contamination , environment@@ alists believe bur@@ st dri@@ ll heads and le@@ aking pi@@ pel@@ ines are the main cause .
In 2008 , the US academic Richard St@@ einer accused S@@ hell of applying significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world . The rate of defects in pi@@ pel@@ ines alone was &quot; several times higher than elsewhere . &quot;
Human figures emerge from the man@@ gro@@ ve sw@@ amp@@ s , that from a distance look deser@@ ted , o@@ il-@@ covered outside gar@@ ages . The figures are stark n@@ aked and covered to the neck in oil .
Under one of the many bar@@ rel@@ s - some connected to pi@@ pes , others scat@@ tered at random over the ground - there is a a fli@@ ck@@ ering fire . An illegal mini refin@@ ery .
Michael , the group leader , explains that the cru@@ de oil is heated in the bar@@ rel for several hours .
First , ben@@ z@@ ine is si@@ ph@@ oned off to a collecting p@@ an , then ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e dri@@ ps from the end of the tube and finally , diesel .
Michael and four assi@@ stants produce up to four 300@@ -@@ li@@ tre bar@@ rel@@ s of diesel a day in this way . &quot; We get 34@@ ,000 n@@ air@@ a for it &quot; - about 22 dollars .
The inhabitants of the del@@ ta use the chronic fuel shortage to their advantage in the largest cru@@ de oil state of sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ aran Africa .
Nigeria has just one refin@@ ery of its own .
The illegal coo@@ ks can still under@@ cut the absur@@ dly low diesel prices of 40 Euro c@@ ents per li@@ tre . They get their raw material for nothing .
The material comes from &quot; bun@@ ker@@ ers &quot; who tap the pipeline network all the way across O@@ gon@@ il@@ and . Over the entire N@@ iger del@@ ta , experts estimate the country loses at least 16 millions lit@@ res of cru@@ de oil a day in this way .
However , only a tiny proportion of the raw material stored by bun@@ ker@@ ers goes on to be refined illegally . Organ@@ ised criminal networks with politicians and high-@@ ranking officers amongst their ranks fill tan@@ kers with the lion &apos;s share and flo@@ g it on the global market .
The activ@@ ist Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i believes the debate around whether the environmental catastrop@@ he is the result of the activities of the population or la@@ x production safety standards is purely academic .
&quot; If the oil companies were not perceived as inter@@ lo@@ pers and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen &apos;s live@@ lihood , there would not be any sab@@ ot@@ age , the@@ ft or illegal refin@@ eries . &quot;
Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i explains that the relationship between the O@@ g@@ oni towards S@@ hell in particular has been destroyed to such an extent that only withdrawal by the company is an option . &quot; Perhaps other nations such as the Chinese will prove to be a better option . &quot;
Michael turns ed@@ gy .
&quot; It &apos;s time you disappear , &quot; says the mus@@ cular oil man .
&quot; The soldiers might turn up at any minute . &quot;
If the illegal oil refin@@ ers are caught by the army &apos;s task force , they are not likely to be j@@ ailed , but will have to pay hef@@ ty bri@@ bes .
It seems that the soldiers , who mainly origin@@ ate from the north of the country , also want to profit from oil , like all other Nig@@ eri@@ ans .
&quot; This dam@@ ned stuff has brought our country to rock bottom in every way , &quot; says Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i .
Investi@@ g@@ ators un@@ cover dangerous defect in A3@@ 80 engines
The A3@@ 80 , it seems , has a major safety issue .
During examination of a plane following an emergency landing , investig@@ ators have discovered a possible defect that could cause &quot; catastrop@@ hi@@ c engine failure . &quot;
The airline Q@@ ant@@ as is now preparing to take the engine manufacturer to court .
The passengers of the Q@@ ant@@ as Airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of November appear to have had considerably more luck than anyone realised . During its investigations , the Australian air safety authority identified a serious safety issue in the engines of some A3@@ 80 planes - and is now warning of a possible construction defect .
The alleged defect would have serious consequences . In a statement published on Thursday , the Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( AT@@ S@@ B ) revealed that the defect could potentially cause f@@ ati@@ gue cra@@ cks and le@@ aks in an oil ho@@ se connection .
This could lead to &quot; catastrop@@ hi@@ c engine failure . &quot;
20 different A3@@ 80 aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es with Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce engines may be affected .
The Q@@ ant@@ as Airbus that was forced to land in Singapore on 4 November was one of those aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es .
The Australian airline is now taking legal steps against the British tur@@ b@@ ine manufacturer .
It has submitted a claim to an Australian federal court in Sydney which leaves open further potential legal measures against the company .
The CEO of Q@@ ant@@ as , Alan Jo@@ y@@ ce , said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident which occurred at the beginning of November .
The heat of the engine had caused parts to become deta@@ ched and had damaged the w@@ ings .
Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce believes an oil fire caused the damage .
Following the incident , up to 40 engines around the world must now be replaced .
The Australian investig@@ ators announced that they will be carrying out further safety tests on the super@@ j@@ um@@ bo@@ s fitted with the affected engines .
AT@@ S@@ B speaker Martin Dol@@ an said that the safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce .
The safety issue was considered sufficiently serious for all affected parties to be informed .
After the forced landing of the Q@@ ant@@ as plane , the airline ground@@ ed its A3@@ 80 fleet for weeks .
Singapore Airlines temporarily kept about three of its ele@@ ven A3@@ 80 on the ground .
Lufthansa replaced the engine in one A3@@ 80 as a precau@@ tion .
The double-@@ deck@@ er is the largest passenger plane in the world .
Coun@@ tr@@ y-@@ wide snow@@ fall un@@ le@@ ash@@ es traffic chaos
Germany all in white . There has been overnight snow@@ fall across most of the country .
There is chaos on many roads , and trains and flights have been cancelled .
At least three people have died in car accidents .
The winter free@@ ze in Germany . In free@@ zing temperatures , almost the entire country was covered in snow on Wednesday night - causing traffic chaos in many areas .
In the north and east of the country , there is 15 cen@@ timet@@ res of snow in some areas .
Traff@@ ic is severely restricted on many motor@@ ways and roads .
S@@ now pl@@ ou@@ ghs were in continuous operation on the A@@ 7 at Fl@@ ens@@ burg , unable to beat the constant snow dri@@ fts .
St@@ ron@@ g winds were also recorded over the Baltic coast .
The Federal Maritime and Hydro@@ graphic Agency ( BS@@ H ) is expecting storm ti@@ des with water levels 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic coast of Sch@@ les@@ wi@@ g-@@ Hol@@ stein from the morning onwards .
In Sax@@ ony , the snow dri@@ fts on motor@@ ways and A-@@ roads have been causing serious problems .
According to the weather service Me@@ te@@ om@@ edi@@ a , Sax@@ on Switzerland was put on red alert - the highest alarm level .
30 cen@@ timet@@ res of fresh snow fell in some parts of the region and fresh strong winds caused dri@@ fts .
A number of lor@@ ries and cars were str@@ anded during the night .
In Sax@@ on@@ y-@@ An@@ halt , the police authorities also reported serious dis@@ ruption on the roads .
S@@ now and wind caused cra@@ w@@ ling traffic and traffic j@@ ams on the A@@ 2 .
In Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia , the A4 and A@@ 9 were affected by snow@@ fall .
According to Deutsche Bahn , there are significant dis@@ rup@@ tions in Sax@@ ony , Sax@@ on@@ y-@@ An@@ halt , Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia and in the north of Bavaria .
S@@ now on the tracks , fallen trees on the ra@@ ils and over@@ head wi@@ res and mal@@ functioning points are the main problems .
In Sax@@ ony , long-@@ distance trains from Leipzig to N@@ ure@@ m@@ berg had to be stopped .
An ICE train to Munich was forced to end its journey in Sa@@ al@@ feld , Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia .
The 16@@ 5 passengers were provided with wo@@ ollen blan@@ k@@ ets , food and drink by fire and amb@@ ul@@ ance personnel .

S@@ now and wind is causing numerous cancell@@ ations at major German airports .
In Munich , a spo@@ kes@@ woman for the flight information centre announced that some cancell@@ ations had already been made .
In Frankfurt am Main , a spo@@ kes@@ woman for Fra@@ port said that 40 flights had already been a@@ xed .
S@@ now pl@@ ou@@ ghs have been in permanent operation .
Only a small number of str@@ anded passengers were at the airport , and there were just under 400 camp beds still available to accommodate them , said the spo@@ kes@@ woman .
Ac@@ ci@@ dents had already occurred on many roads by Wednesday evening .
One lor@@ ry driver died in the evening in a col@@ li@@ sion with a train on a level crossing in O@@ sth@@ ol@@ stein .
The train driver suffered light inj@@ uries .
A similar accident occurred near N@@ ure@@ m@@ berg on sno@@ w-@@ covered roads . A truck was str@@ anded on a level crossing when the vehicle got stuck in the snow .
The driver died .
Four passengers in the train were injured - the line from Bay@@ re@@ u@@ th to N@@ ure@@ m@@ berg was closed into the hours of the morning .
A 30-@@ year-old woman also died after she over@@ turned on black ice near A@@ schaff@@ enburg .
There is , however , some good news from forec@@ ast@@ ers . Although the snow will continue to be loose and pow@@ der@@ y causing snow dri@@ fts even in light winds ,

Deutsche Bank seeking buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to sell its em@@ ble@@ m . According to a newspaper report , the bank is looking for buyers for the two office high-@@ rises at its Frankfurt headquarters .
The property could fet@@ ch up to 500 million Euros .
Deutsche Bank only recently renovated its company headquarters . The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking quarter have been modernis@@ ed as ban@@ kers returned to their former workplace .
But the financial institution now clearly wants to rec@@ ou@@ p the costs of renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-@@ rises , writes Financial Times Germany , quot@@ ing a spo@@ kes@@ man .
The spo@@ kes@@ man did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale .
&quot; We are constantly re@@ viewing whether it is better to own property ourselves or to sell it and then rent it back , &quot; he said .
Germany &apos;s largest financial institution is aband@@ oning its company headquarters after only a limited period of time .
The bank first took over the two towers for 27@@ 2 million Euros in mid-@@ 2007 from the investors of one of its own funds and went on to implement an extensive programme of renovation .
According to the information available , the extensive renovation cost around 200 million Euros .
A sale would earn the bank a lot of money .
According to the newspaper , industry experts estimate the value of the towers , ren@@ amed the &quot; Gre@@ ent@@ o@@ wers , &quot; at around 500 million Euros .
Whether the buildings will be resol@@ d to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently not decided , said the spo@@ kes@@ man .
Th@@ ous@@ ands m@@ our@@ n lost friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have attended a mem@@ orial service for the min@@ ers declared dead after a series of explo@@ sions .
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies , as the safety situation in the sha@@ ft where the accident happened remains prec@@ arious .
Almost two weeks ago , a violent explosion occurred in the Pi@@ ke River M@@ ine near the city of Gre@@ y@@ mouth .
29 min@@ ers aged between 17 and 62 were bu@@ ried alive below ground .
A probe was lower@@ ed into the sha@@ ft , but no signs of the survi@@ vors were discovered .
O@@ wing to the high concentration of po@@ ison@@ ous gases and further subsequent explo@@ sions , no rescu@@ ers were allowed into the sha@@ ft for safety reasons .
After the second violent de@@ ton@@ ation , the authorities and experts acted on the assumption that there was no chance any of the min@@ ers had survi@@ ved .
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies .
Family members and friends remembered the dead in a mem@@ orial service .
In bright sunshine , ten thousand people gathered in Gre@@ y@@ mouth on New Zealand &apos;s South Island .
They held a two-@@ minute silence .
29 tables were set up in honour of the bu@@ ried min@@ ers , displa@@ ying hel@@ m@@ ets , lamps and their names .
Pic@@ tures and personal items , including clothing and sur@@ f@@ boards , were also on display .
The flags were flying at half m@@ ast at all government buildings in the country .
New Zealand had hoped that the min@@ ers would come back &quot; from the dep@@ ths of the earth &quot; to the surface , said the Prime Minister of New Ze@@ eland John Key to the crow@@ ds at the mem@@ orial .
&quot; But they never came home . &quot;
La@@ wri@@ e Dre@@ w , father of tra@@ pped coal min@@ er Z@@ en Dre@@ w , said that he could not come to terms with the death of his son until he had seen his body .
Several foreign diplom@@ ats took part in the mem@@ orial service alongside the Prime Minister and members of victims &quot; families .
British and South African min@@ ers were also bu@@ ried alive in the first explosion on 19 November .
Res@@ cu@@ ers began by ext@@ ingu@@ ishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand &apos;s South Island .
Super@@ inten@@ dent G@@ ary Kno@@ w@@ les told journalists that work would begin to cool the fi@@ erce temperatures inside the mine as soon as the explo@@ sive gases had been displaced .
To hell , war@@ ri@@ ors !
Is there a place for g@@ ore in art house cinema ?
The film director Nicolas Win@@ ding Re@@ f@@ n is testing old gen@@ re boundaries af@@ res@@ h with his war@@ ri@@ or ep@@ ic &quot; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising . &quot;
What audience was the Danish director Nicolas Win@@ ding Re@@ f@@ n thinking of when he was shooting &quot; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising &quot; ?
A captured Vi@@ king war@@ ri@@ or with only one eye ( Mad@@ s Mik@@ kel@@ sen ) escap@@ es his tor@@ ment@@ ors and kno@@ cks down his opponents with almost super@@ human powers - which sounds ideal for young male vie@@ wers on the search for g@@ ore and action , particularly as our her@@ o has a preference for brutal killing methods and is not a@@ verse to te@@ aring out the ent@@ ra@@ ils from the living bodies of his enemies when he is in a bad mood .
On the other hand , O@@ ne-@@ E@@ ye , as he is actually called , does not say a word during the entire film , and even the other figures are only in@@ duced to say one or two sentences at most , or to em@@ it a few exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating death cri@@ es .
Otherwise , the film is silent , luxuri@@ ating in the e@@ eri@@ ly beautiful hills of Scotland that provides the scenery for the Vi@@ king world of around a thousand years ago .
More suited to adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in exist@@ enti@@ alism and very smooth tracking shots .
Great when a film has several target groups , but a shame if they are mutually exclusive .
Since his wild and sty@@ li@@ sed drug dealer tri@@ log@@ y &quot; P@@ us@@ her , &quot; Director Win@@ ding Re@@ f@@ n has been seen as a kind of Danish version of Qu@@ entin Tar@@ ant@@ ino , but sto@@ ically ref@@ uses to make his works accessible to the main@@ stream by using a little more hum@@ our or to the art house by displa@@ ying less brut@@ ality .
Most art cinema enthusiasts would be deter@@ red by the cer@@ eb@@ ral matter and ent@@ ra@@ ils flying around .
If they have not already done so , action fans will die of bo@@ re@@ dom when O@@ ne-@@ E@@ ye - for somewhat in@@ deci@@ pher@@ able reasons - sets off by ship to Jerusalem with a tro@@ op of violent Christian mis@@ sion@@ aries , ending up stuck for what seems like an e@@ tern@@ ity in dead cal@@ ms and fo@@ g before the crew arri@@ ves in what is clearly America - where the silence continues .
No wonder then that &apos; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising &quot; has not found a cinema distribut@@ or in Germany and has only appeared on DVD .
This is a shame , particularly because the cin@@ em@@ at@@ ography is superb , but also because at times there is a stir@@ ring work of cinema behind the pre@@ ten@@ tious , at times bloo@@ dy fa@@ ç@@ ade - and that work of cinema deserves some attention .
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot , but all about atmosphere - a fe@@ ver@@ ish dream that has become a film .
For the viewer , there is no escape from that dream .
Re@@ f@@ n hardly allows the viewer a single moment of relaxation and slowly ch@@ ok@@ es the same view with his iron images and the glo@@ om@@ y tran@@ ce-@@ like sound@@ track - and the in@@ comprehensible hat@@ red that strikes out at the viewer from the hearts of the characters .
Only one small bl@@ ond boy who stands fai@@ th@@ fully at O@@ ne-@@ E@@ ye &apos;s side re@@ tains anything of inno@@ c@@ ence - all other characters are driven by fur@@ y .
Above all , it is the one-@@ e@@ yed her@@ o who is driven by fur@@ y - whose mo@@ tives are never explained , but who at some point becomes the war@@ ri@@ or from hell for his enemies and temporary allies alike , and perhaps even the m@@ essenger of the devi@@ l himself .
He equ@@ als dam@@ nation , but perhaps only for the already dam@@ ned .
&quot; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising &quot; is an en@@ ig@@ matic film that people will h@@ ate and admire , to their ch@@ ag@@ r@@ in , v@@ ex@@ ation and amaz@@ ement .
An experience .
M@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous earth@@ works
The International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency ( IA@@ EA ) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria .
The country is ref@@ using to comment - but is allowing inspections .
To@@ wards mid@@ night on the night of 5th to 6th September 2007 , at least four Israeli F-@@ 15 I figh@@ ter j@@ ets attacked a mysteri@@ ous , cu@@ be@@ -@@ shaped building in Syria .
It stands on the banks of the E@@ up@@ hr@@ ates river ; the next major city , 30 kilometres away , is Da@@ ir Alz@@ our .
The name turns up in IA@@ EA documents when there is mention of the re@@ actor Syria is alleged to have built in the cu@@ be@@ -@@ shaped building hidden in a valley cut off from the country &apos;s electricity network - with aid from North Korea .
According to a brie@@ fing from the US foreign intelligence service , the CIA , at the end of April 2008 , the re@@ actor , commonly referred to by the name of the nearest settlement El Ki@@ bar , could be used to produce pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um - which could in turn be used to build atom@@ ic bom@@ bs .
The technology from the fif@@ ties is of very little use for any other purpose .
The CIA gave a video presentation with bl@@ ur@@ ry satellite images .
Using computer animation , the agency showed where the components of the re@@ actor are believed to have been located before its destruction - the re@@ actor is said to be a smaller copy of the north Korean model from the atom@@ ic centre in Y@@ ong@@ by@@ on .
They agency also produced photos showing the building close up , and even its interior .
The re@@ actor is believed to have been almost ready for commission@@ ing , but not yet supplied with fuel ro@@ ds .
Now , more than three years after the bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment , almost no more is known . In fact , the questions seem to have increased with time .
The former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his mem@@ o@@ irs that , although the CIA had known before the attack that Syria was building a re@@ actor in El Ki@@ bar , it had not discovered any signs that there was &quot; an active nuclear weapons programme &quot; in the country .
Many intelligence officials in Europe are even more scep@@ tical and speak only of an &quot; alleged re@@ actor , &quot; even if they believe the CIA presentation was &quot; plau@@ sible . &quot;
They lack hard evidence , as does the IA@@ EA .
A@@ sk@@ ed how certain he is that a re@@ actor exists this summer , a high-@@ ranking UN diplom@@ at rep@@ lied lac@@ on@@ ically that the IA@@ EA had &quot; enough material to pose questions . &quot;
The Syri@@ ans , in any case , rapidly removed the rub@@ ble of the supposedly &quot; un@@ used military building &quot; and lev@@ elled the area completely .
Nonetheless , in June 2008 , an IA@@ EA team led by chief inspec@@ tor O@@ ll@@ i Hein@@ onen discovered traces of man-@@ made ur@@ anium in El Ki@@ bar .
In addition , the IA@@ EA obtained commer@@ cially produced satellite images from a Member State from the period immediately prec@@ eding the attack - images said to be more convincing that the images presented by the CIA .
However , the images were not available on the market , as the unknown customer - Israel , perhaps - has purchased them exclusively .
Hence , the IA@@ EA cannot independently verify their authentic@@ ity .
Syria has claimed never to have had a secret atom@@ ic programme or to have built a re@@ actor .
Dam@@ as@@ cus claims the ur@@ anium was from Israeli weapons .
However , after analy@@ sing the partic@@ les , the IA@@ EA rejected the claim as im@@ plau@@ sible .
Since then , Dam@@ as@@ cus has avoided discussion on this point - or on the satellite images .
Syria has also prevented inspec@@ tors carrying out a second inspection in El Ki@@ bar or to access the rub@@ ble of the bom@@ bed building .
Israel is also maintaining a st@@ ony silence .
&quot; We will never comment on this , &quot; said the former Prime Minister E@@ hu@@ d Ol@@ m@@ ert , in office at the time of the attack , confir@@ ming the official position .
So the investigation has continued since June 2008 without conclusion and &quot; is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority , &quot; according to a high-@@ ranking western diplom@@ at at the IA@@ EA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately , a serious infringement of the non-@@ proliferation treaty remains un@@ resolved in the hands of the IA@@ EA .
The IA@@ EA clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three additional facilities that are supposed to have had a &quot; functional connection &quot; with the alleged re@@ actor - and in contrast to the re@@ actor , still exist .
However , inspec@@ tors have not so far dis@@ closed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them seem suspi@@ cious .
According to information provided by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , they are referred to internally at the IA@@ EA as Mar@@ j as@@ -S@@ ul@@ tan , Mas@@ y@@ af and I@@ skand@@ ari@@ ya , referring to towns nearby .
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington ( IS@@ IS ) has identified these locations and found a complex of buildings on satellite images at Mas@@ y@@ af which is very probably one of the suspi@@ cious buildings .
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that Syria is ref@@ using the IA@@ EA access to the three locations .
In Vienna , there is word that the Syri@@ ans were afraid of some kind of fishing ex@@ pedition and worry that the IA@@ EA is being sent out by the USA as a van@@ guard to sp@@ y out military facilities .
This fear was exacerb@@ ated by the fact that nuclear inspec@@ tors had been ti@@ pped off about the facilities by the US secret services .
The IA@@ EA has documents , including satellite photos , which suggest that material has been transported between the three locations and the cu@@ be@@ -@@ shaped building on the E@@ up@@ hr@@ ates river .
A high-@@ ranking western diplom@@ at in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be &quot; related to fuel production . &quot;
However , there were &quot; no signs of sensitive activities &quot; such as ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment or re@@ processing - processes that are required to build atom@@ ic weapons .
This type of re@@ actor is fu@@ elled by ur@@ anium , but not enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium .
However , a reasonable gu@@ ess could be made as to where the ur@@ anium came from and where the pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um from that ur@@ anium would be extrac@@ ted for use in a bomb .
It remains unclear , however , whether rub@@ ble that could contain valuable trace deposits has been stored at the three locations .
No one is ad@@ mitting to having any information on where the rub@@ ble has ended up , as if hundreds of tru@@ ck@@ loads of earth had simply van@@ ished into thin air .
The salt mine of Al Ti@@ b@@ ni , located just several kilometres from El Ki@@ bar on the other side of the E@@ up@@ hr@@ ates and investigated by Syria in 1998 as a possible storage location for radioactive waste is an unlikely location , according to the IA@@ EA .
The former IA@@ EA inspec@@ tor Robert Kel@@ ley recently connected the mine and the re@@ actor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine , Jan@@ e &apos;s Intel@@ ligence Review .
Images from or@@ bit , however , show that Syria under@@ took earth@@ works at the three suspec@@ ted locations and removed large containers after the IA@@ EA had demanded access .
That may be coinci@@ dence , but has done nothing to clear suspi@@ cion .
There is also talk in diplomatic circles of the IA@@ EA having spent a number of months developing an inspections plan that would allow Syria to protect any military secre@@ ts - the costs alone shows the extent of the inspec@@ tors &quot; interest .
Dam@@ as@@ cus , however , also br@@ us@@ hed off this proposal .
Although western diplom@@ ats in Vienna had offered re@@ assurance , by saying that since the re@@ actor was destroyed the issue had low priority , the US amb@@ assador G@@ ly@@ n Davi@@ es has been bringing so-called special inspections to the table , which is one of the most powerful instruments available to the Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based atom@@ ic authority to carry out inspections .
Yu@@ ki@@ ya A@@ man@@ o , current Director General of the IA@@ EA , who is believed to have suggested the inspection , has already spoken of &quot; an option that I am open to in the future , &quot; but is still hesit@@ ating .
The option is high risk . On the one hand it requires a majority in the Govern@@ ing Council of the IA@@ EA , and a number of the 35 countries represented are anything other than e@@ ager for escal@@ ation .
On the other hand , as one diplom@@ at points out , &quot; what if , in the end , they find nothing ? &quot;
Love in times of war
Since Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie began working on her as yet anonymous direc@@ ting de@@ but in the summer , there has been trouble .
She wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man .
No one really knows much more than that - but that alone is enough to cause un@@ ease .
The rum@@ our st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly persi@@ sts that the woman - a Muslim - falls in love with her Serbian rap@@ ist during the Yugosla@@ vian war .
Bosni@@ an women &apos;s organisations have prote@@ sted immediately , in response to which several days of shooting planned in Sar@@ aje@@ vo were moved to Hungary at short notice .
Since then , the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-@@ production , but there are still protests in Bosnia .
Bak@@ ira Has@@ e@@ č@@ i@@ ć from the Association of Women Vic@@ tims of War wrote to Jo@@ lie via the UN refugee agency UN@@ H@@ CR and demanded a meeting with the ac@@ tress , reported a Bosni@@ an newspaper - Jo@@ lie herself is an amb@@ assador for the UN agency .
However , she can hardly be described as diplomatic - Jo@@ lie offered to meet the women weeks ago in Hungary , but they dec@@ lined .
The meeting must take place in Bosnia , insi@@ sts Has@@ e@@ č@@ i@@ ć .
According to Has@@ e@@ č@@ i@@ ć , there were no love stories in rap@@ e camps , and Jo@@ lie &apos;s behaviour towards victims told her enough about the script .
According to the UN refugee organisation , her organisation has recommended dis@@ missing Jo@@ lie as an amb@@ assador , reports the Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
But what kind of script exactly has Jo@@ lie written ?
The Bosni@@ an Ministry of Culture that read her script issued a permit for shooting in Sar@@ aje@@ vo after some to-@@ ing and fro@@ -@@ ing - it is not entirely clear why Jo@@ lie then did not go to Bosnia .
They fle@@ d@@ g@@ ling writer herself asser@@ ts that she has no political mo@@ tives in her film , has read up on the Yugosla@@ vian conflict assi@@ du@@ ously and wants to show the horri@@ fic consequences of war and give a voice to all sides involved .
In terms of content , however , she remained vague .
A second , considerably different sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the film is being circul@@ ated on the internet . The lovers had known each other before the out@@ break of war and meet again when she , a Bosni@@ an Muslim , is ki@@ dn@@ apped to a Serbian camp where he is working as a guard .
That sounds a very different story to the &quot; rap@@ e victim falls for tor@@ tur@@ er &quot; scenario .
The fact that Jo@@ lie &apos;s film actually begins before the war is clear .
According to Jo@@ lie , the pressure on her is &quot; unfair and based on false information . &quot;
Now only the h@@ ack@@ ers from Hollywood can give her any peace by illegally posting the script on the web , as has been the fate of so many other scripts .
Let &apos;s get out of here
This evening , everything is finally going well for the Irish .
Not a trace of un@@ happiness .
The home team is domin@@ ating its guests from Sweden , Finland and the USA too much for that .
The fans are ho@@ oting for joy against a sound@@ track of b@@ lar@@ ing music and stamp@@ ing feet .
The Ba@@ i@@ ley Pu@@ b in Cor@@ k , southern Ireland , is ro@@ cking because the table tennis players are thro@@ wing ping p@@ ong balls into beer gl@@ asses over a three met@@ re distance - and sc@@ oring .
&quot; Be@@ er p@@ ong &quot; is the name of the bizarre spectac@@ le ; the winner gets 500 Euros win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer p@@ ong world champ@@ ionship in January .
C@@ ian T@@ anner is a quiet type ; this sh@@ ri@@ ll drinking game and the re@@ tic@@ ent computer scienti@@ st do not really go together .
But the 26@@ -@@ year-old is trying to am@@ use himself by playing , to di@@ stra@@ ct from the burning question of what the future will bring .
He has not scheduled in a round of gambling in Las Vegas - he will be taking part in job interviews in New Zealand in January .
&quot; I have a wei@@ rd feeling doing it , &quot; he says .
&quot; It is so far from home and I still don &apos;t have any work there . &quot;
Still , his gir@@ l@@ friend is waiting for him in Au@@ ck@@ land - &quot; she got her dream job as event manager in no time - perhaps a good sign , &quot; says the young man and sm@@ iles .
In response to the poor outlook at home , two of T@@ anner &apos;s three sib@@ lings are already taking their chances abroad .
His sister Y@@ von@@ ne , a social worker , is in Sydney and his brother Co@@ lin has got a job as an IT consul@@ tant in London .
Young people are leaving . T@@ anner &apos;s family is hardly the exception for families on the island .
100@@ ,000 Irish men and women will leave the country in the near future , predi@@ ct experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ( ES@@ RI ) in Dublin .
By 2015 , they estimate a total of 200@@ ,000 em@@ igrants .
For a small country with only 4.@@ 5 million inhabitants , that will be a significant loss .
If the predic@@ tions prove to be correct , there will be a wave of em@@ igration comparable to the em@@ igration Ireland suffered in the 8@@ 0s .
After a decade of growth that brought great prosperity for the Irish with it , the hard times have returned .
The economic crisis is particularly be@@ wil@@ dering for young , well-@@ educated Irish who have only seen things getting better .
Job losses and social des@@ cent seemed absurd in the boom years .
Everyone was needed and there was money abo@@ und@@ ing .
Since then , three out of every ten men and women under thirty are without work .
In the Irish Times , there are many letters from young em@@ igrants compla@@ ining that &quot; everything is going down the p@@ an in Ireland . &quot;
&quot; There should be a revolution against the politicians and ban@@ kers - but anyone who can simply leaves and our country is losing an entire generation . &quot;
&quot; Can the last person please turn out the light . &quot;
Law student Le@@ anne C@@ aul@@ field , President of the Irish Union of Stu@@ dents , sees a dis@@ mal future ahead , because the government is engaged in win@@ do@@ w-@@ dres@@ sing and is no longer offering young people prospects for the future .
&quot; They are reducing the minimum wage , but they don &apos;t have a strategy to create new jobs , &quot; says the 20-@@ year-old .
She sees her fellow students making their way from one un@@ paid intern@@ ship to another .
Her greatest concern is that she will have to em@@ ig@@ rate in four years as well .
&quot; The thought is sad and de@@ pressing . &quot;
On the other hand , men such as Stephen Mc@@ Lar@@ non try to give the situation a positive sp@@ in .
Mc@@ Lar@@ non organis@@ es the Wor@@ king@@ Ab@@ road@@ Expo , a fair offering an all-@@ round service for work abroad .
&quot; For people starting a career , working abroad is a great chance to take your first steps onto the career lad@@ der , &quot; says the manager .
There are photos of sur@@ fers in Australia and snow@@ boar@@ ders in Canada on his website .
The message is clear . Working abroad is not g@@ alley duty , but a source of freedom and fun .
For the last six months , Se@@ án O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an has known what it feels like to build something somewhere else .
As there was nothing more for the 29@@ -@@ year-old engineer in Ireland , he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on building sites in Germany .
They are currently working on a fashion boutique in Gel@@ sen@@ kir@@ chen .
In January , they will move on to Han@@ over or Berlin - to the next project .
In the meantime , O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an visits his home country sel@@ dom , as he is taking on extra shi@@ fts to be able to pay off the mort@@ gage on his house at home .
&quot; The situation is really a bit cra@@ zy , &quot; he says , as he goes through the door of his house for the first time in a long time .
&quot; I am earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I barely see . &quot;
He lau@@ ghs a little self-@@ consci@@ ously and wander@@ s through the cold rooms .
The small house is in a class@@ y neighbourhood with tended front gardens . Large , expensive cars are par@@ ked in the dri@@ ve@@ ways .
O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an bought the house with his sister four years ago for 3@@ 80@@ ,000 Euros - financed with a 100 percent mort@@ gage .
&quot; They were mad times - there was easy money without too many questions , &quot; he says .
Is he worried that things could go wrong with the mort@@ gage ?
O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an thinks for a while , p@@ ours some more tea and says : &quot; I don &apos;t have any children to feed and I am young . Even if everything goes wrong , I can start again . &quot;
The civil engineer does not like the mo@@ an@@ ing that he h@@ ears so often .
&quot; No one has to star@@ ve - out situation is no@@ where near as dramatic as times this island has gone through in the past , &quot; he says .
&quot; Working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps we only really feel Irish by going abroad . &quot;
He lau@@ ghs and rec@@ alls how his father went to England in the last great economic crisis .
&quot; Seven years later , he was back and life went on in Ireland , just like that . &quot;
C@@ ian T@@ anner likes that idea .
Le@@ ave the future open and just see what it is like living somewhere else .
He has already spent a few years working in London and why should things not go well for him and his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ en@@ din New Zealand ?
One thing still wor@@ ries him well and truly these days - the party for his 27@@ th birthday on Friday in Dublin .
He wor@@ ries it could de@@ generate into a f@@ are@@ well party .
&quot; Just not too much emo@@ tion , &quot; he says and drinks a large gul@@ p of beer .
&quot; F@@ are@@ well - that sounds alarming . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ets just call it a going away party , really relaxed with a few friends , a couple of drinks and the od@@ d game . &quot;
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to edge up , as does backing for private enterprise .
Cri@@ me has become a bigger worry than unemployment .
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region .
Those are some of the findings of the latest Lat@@ in@@ ob@@ ar@@ ó@@ metro pol@@ l taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Econom@@ ist .
Because the pol@@ l has been taken regularly since 1995 , it tracks changes in attitude across the region .
Two related things stand out in the results of this year &apos;s pol@@ l , taken in September and early October .
The first is Latin America &apos;s fairly sunny mood .
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions .
Support for democracy has risen notic@@ e@@ ably in several countries on the Pacific ri@@ m of South America ( see table 1 ) .
For example in Peru , where economic growth has aver@@ aged 6 % a year since 2002 , support for democracy has risen from a low of 40 % in 2005 to 61 % this year .
It also rose in Mexico , where the economy has recover@@ ed after suffering a big drop in output last year .
But only around half of respon@@ dents in Mexico and Brazil , the region &apos;s two most popul@@ ous countries , are convinced demo@@ crats , which dra@@ gs down the regional average ( see chart 2 ) .
Some 44 % of respon@@ dents across the region pron@@ ounced themselves satisfied with how their country &apos;s democracy works in practice , the same figure as last year but a big increase on the 25 % in 2001 ( chart 3 ) .
Some 34 % said they had confidence in their country &apos;s Congress and 45 % in their government , the same as last year in both cases but up shar@@ ply from 2003 ( 17 % and 24 % respectively ) .
A decade ago economic wo@@ es in Latin America undermined support for democracy .
That it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery .
In addition , a stronger social safety net has helped to shi@@ eld the poor .
( The United Nations &apos; Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only margin@@ ally in 2009 and has fallen again this year , to 32 % . )
But the mood varies widely from country to country ( see chart 4 ) .
Brazil &apos;s strong economic performance and the popularity of its out@@ going president , Lu@@ iz In@@ á@@ cio Lul@@ a da Sil@@ va , is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress .
That is scar@@ cer in Mexico and Central America , where the recession was more severe and violent crime has wor@@ sen@@ ed .
For only the second time since the p@@ olls began , more respon@@ dents across Latin America as a whole c@@ ite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem facing their country ( see chart 5 ) .
Some 31 % say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from 38 % last year and is the lowest figure since 1995 .
A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy : some 71 % of respon@@ dents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from 56 % in 2007 ( see chart 6 ) .
Some 58 % agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed , up from 47 % last year .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , 62 % of respon@@ dents in Venezuela hold that view ( and 80 % there back private enterprise ) even though their left-@@ wing president , Hu@@ go Ch@@ á@@ vez , is ex@@ propri@@ ating many private companies .
Brazil is the country which exercises most leadership in the region , mentioned by 19 % of respon@@ dents ( up from 18 % last year ) , followed by the United States ( 9 % , un@@ changed from last year ) and Venezuela ( 9 % , down from 11 % last year ) .
But the United States is seen as the most influential country by respon@@ dents in Mexico and much of Central America , whereas Venezuela enjoys that distinction in Ecu@@ ador , the Domin@@ ican Republic and Nicar@@ agua .
A vote rub@@ b@@ ished
N@@ obo@@ dy expected Haiti &apos;s general election on November 28@@ th to be perfect .
But it was far worse than the out@@ si@@ ders who are trying to help the stri@@ cken country fe@@ ared .
It featured stu@@ ff@@ ed bal@@ lot boxes and repeat voting , bal@@ lot sli@@ ps scat@@ tered in gut@@ ters , tra@@ shed poll@@ ing stations and intim@@ id@@ ation .
P@@ oll@@ ing stations opened hours late .
Many Ha@@ iti@@ ans , including lots displaced by January &apos;s earthquake , ro@@ amed around trying to find out where to vote .
Some of them eventually gave up .
A do@@ zen presidential candidates , including several pre@@ sum@@ ed fron@@ t-@@ run@@ ners , cri@@ ed fraud and called for the election &apos;s ann@@ ul@@ ment .
Prote@@ sts , some of them violent , fla@@ red across the country .
Nevertheless , Ed@@ mond Mu@@ let , the United Nations &apos; top official in Haiti , declared it &quot; a fairly good election in many ways . &quot;
Ob@@ servers from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community said cau@@ ti@@ ously that they did &quot; not believe these irregularities , serious as they were , necessarily invali@@ dated the process . &quot;
In other words , the show goes on .
The electoral authority , which opponents claim is be@@ hol@@ den to Ren@@ é Pr@@ é@@ val , the un@@ popular out@@ going president and his candidate , Ju@@ de C@@ é@@ l@@ esti@@ n , is due to announce preliminary results on December 7th .
The expected run@@ -@@ off is scheduled for January .
All hope in the election is not lost .
The two leading opposition candidates , Michel Mar@@ tel@@ ly , a ra@@ p musi@@ cian , and Mir@@ lan@@ de Man@@ ig@@ at , a former first lady , have re@@ treated from their initial call for the vote to be declared invali@@ d .
But there may be trouble if Mr C@@ é@@ l@@ esti@@ n , who has little or no disc@@ ern@@ i@@ ble support among voters , is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the run@@ -@@ off .
With a ch@@ ol@@ era epide@@ mic ra@@ ging , and more than 1@@ m earthquake survi@@ vors still living in t@@ ents , there were fears that turn@@ out would be low .
In the event , a lot of Ha@@ iti@@ ans wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so by dis@@ organisation .
Some 25@@ 0@@ ,000 identity cards , required for voting , remained un@@ distributed shortly before the election .
Much is at stake .
Aid donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in Haiti &apos;s reconstruction .
And so , it is clear , do Ha@@ iti@@ ans themselves .
Ti@@ p@@ to@@ eing to the centre
In the weeks since she was suddenly wi@@ do@@ wed , Crist@@ ina Fern@@ án@@ dez , Argentina &apos;s president , has benef@@ ited from a wave of public sympathy that has boo@@ sted her approval rating by 20 points , to over 50 % , its highest level since she was elected in 2007 .
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year may depend on whether or not the vi@@ sibly grie@@ ving Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez aband@@ ons the in@@ transi@@ gence of her late husband , predecessor and political partner , N@@ é@@ st@@ or Kir@@ chner .
And on that the signs are mixed .
Mr Kir@@ chner , who continued to handle economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president , was in the hab@@ it of drawing up budgets which under@@ estimated tax revenues , economic growth and inflation .
That allowed the first couple to spend the extra revenues at will .
On paper Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez &apos;s government lost its majority in Congress last year .
But the opposition is divided , and it was thrown further into dis@@ array by Mr Kir@@ chner &apos;s death of a heart attack on October 27@@ th .
Some dis@@ sident members of the ruling Per@@ on@@ ist movement have r@@ al@@ lied to Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez .
But after cha@@ o@@ tic sessions ( in which a parliament@@ arian pun@@ ched another in the face , and others accused the government of bri@@ ber@@ y ) , Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget .
&quot; I &apos;m not going to argue , &quot; said the president .
The 2010 budget will now apply next year , giving the president even more room to spend at will .
The economy is over@@ heating wil@@ dly : it is likely to grow by up to 9 % this year .
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.@@ 1 % , but many private estimates - and tra@@ de-@@ union wage demands - put the figure close to 30 % .
Mr Kir@@ chner , who took office in 2003 when Argentina was scar@@ red by economic collapse , made growth and poverty reduction , rather than controlling inflation , his priorities .
He refused to deal with the IMF , har@@ ass@@ ed the private sector and pur@@ ged IN@@ D@@ EC , the statistics agency , which proce@@ eded to doctor official inflation statistics .
Mi@@ ght Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez now moderate these policies ?
She has called for talks between private business and union leaders .
And her officials are saying that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 % .
The economy has been bu@@ o@@ yed by high world prices for Argentina &apos;s farm exports .
But inflation has ero@@ ded the boost to growth provided by a big de@@ valu@@ ation in 2002 .
That may be why Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina &apos;s financial ties to the rest of the world .
Ear@@ lier this year the government struck a deal with bon@@ d@@ holders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of debt on which Argentina def@@ aul@@ ted in 2001 .
Now Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez seems to be ed@@ ging towards an agreement with credi@@ tor governments group@@ ed in the Paris Club , to which it ow@@ es some $ 6.@@ 7 billion .
The Kir@@ chn@@ ers always insi@@ sted this could not involve over@@ sight by the IMF , as is custom@@ ary .
But last month Ama@@ do Bou@@ d@@ ou , the economy minister , announced that the fund will provide &quot; technical assistance &quot; to design a new national consu@@ mer@@ -@@ price index , which looks like a pre@@ lu@@ de to cleaning up IN@@ D@@ EC .
It is not clear whether Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term now that her husband is no longer at her side .
If she does , she needs to win the support of the middle class , much of which has tired of kir@@ chn@@ er@@ ismo .
By the time Argent@@ ines return from their summer holidays in March , the wave of sympathy for her will have eb@@ bed .
If she wants to win another election she will have to decide whether or not quiet@@ ly to re@@ pu@@ di@@ ate many of her husband &apos;s policies .
Hal@@ f a che@@ er for China
Taiwan &apos;s voters are in@@ ching towards a kind of closer union with the main@@ land .
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the stra@@ it ?
More than 7.@@ 5@@ m voters turned out on November 27@@ th , 70 % of those eligible , to elect may@@ ors and city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors in five urban districts , in what is seen as a broad assessment of the president , M@@ a Y@@ ing-@@ je@@ ou .
Mr M@@ a himself has become a sur@@ ro@@ gate for feelings about the main@@ land , having for@@ ged ground@@ breaking business links , including a partial free-@@ trade pact , in the biggest re@@ arrangement of relations with China proper since 1949 .
Mr M@@ a passed the test , but only just .
Although his Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang party ( KM@@ T ) ended up winning three of the five may@@ or@@ alties , it failed to win a majority of the votes .
Instead , the Democratic Pro@@ gressive Party ( D@@ PP ) , which has le@@ ant towards ful@@ ler independence for Taiwan , won nearly 50 % of all votes to the KM@@ T &apos;s 45 % .
H@@ ad this been a presidential pol@@ l , Mr M@@ a would be in trouble .
Since he was elected two years ago his party &apos;s share of the vote has fallen by perhaps 8 % .
For the first time , the D@@ PP drew even with the KM@@ T in the city coun@@ cils .
The election saw most of the stap@@ les of Tai@@ wan@@ ese elections , including ro@@ w@@ dy campaign trucks and fla@@ g-@@ wa@@ ving mass r@@ allies with sk@@ im@@ pi@@ ly cla@@ d dancing girls .
It even saw the obligatory mysteri@@ ous assass@@ ination attempt .
S@@ ean Li@@ en , son of Li@@ en Ch@@ an , the KM@@ T &apos;s hon@@ or@@ ary chairman , was st@@ umping for a KM@@ T candidate on the eve of the election .
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr Li@@ en clean through the face , wo@@ und@@ ing him and killing a b@@ yst@@ ander .
B@@ iz@@ ar@@ rely , it has not been determined whether the gun@@ man intended to harm Mr Li@@ en or to settle a dispute with the candidate .
Ei@@ ther way , says T@@ sa@@ i In@@ g-@@ wen , the leader of the D@@ PP , the shooting affected the election , casting suspi@@ cion on the D@@ PP and driving voters towards the KM@@ T .
Perhaps the only big winner from the campaign was China .
It was striking how the issue of the main@@ land itself was ab@@ sent .
Instead candidates j@@ ou@@ sted over plans for public housing and job creation .
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and lo@@ ath@@ es China &apos;s military threat .
So , the KM@@ T tends to avoid par@@ ading its ties to the government in Beijing .
But this time the D@@ PP also refra@@ ined from whi@@ pping up anti-@@ China sen@@ timent .
It is responding to a new awareness that Chinese business is essential to Taiwan &apos;s economic survival .
Mr M@@ a , for his part , claimed confirmation that his China policy is acceptable to the Tai@@ wan@@ ese majority .
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue supplying commercial swe@@ et@@ en@@ ers , in line with its strategy for l@@ uring Taiwan back to the fold .
China wa@@ sted no time sending a negoti@@ ator to Tai@@ pe@@ i to arrange for a summit on investment protection and medical co-operation .
Certainly , it would like to see political integration too , but first things first .
Better to wait till after the 2012 presidential election for that .
The D@@ PP has anyway re@@ invented itself .
Two years ago it was at a low point : its former leader , Ch@@ en S@@ hu@@ i-@@ bian , had been sent to j@@ ail on charges of corruption .
President in 2000-@@ 08 , he was a fire@@ brand for explicit independence .
But under the leadership of Ms T@@ sa@@ i , a new generation of moder@@ ates has emerged and the D@@ PP is working hard to attract professionals and you@@ ths .
Ms T@@ sa@@ i has been ha@@ iled as a D@@ PP candidate for the presidency , as has S@@ u T@@ sen@@ g-@@ chan@@ g , who served under Mr Ch@@ en .
Their party is now doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing .
Ms T@@ sa@@ i announced plans for a th@@ ink@@ -@@ tank to act as a point of contact between the D@@ PP and China , provided their talks can be held without pre@@ conditions .
Ms T@@ sa@@ i tells the Tai@@ wan@@ ese public that her party presents a &quot; tru@@ st@@ worthy alternative &quot; to Mr M@@ a &apos;s ha@@ sty approach to China .
Mr Ch@@ en seems in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated by the shift .
In a statement issued from his cell he said that the D@@ PP &apos;s candidates would have f@@ ared better if they had insi@@ sted that Taiwan is a separate country .
He even ordered Mr S@@ u , a pragmati@@ st , not to run for the presidency .
Even without Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s interference , the D@@ PP will struggle to choose between its potential candidates .
The KM@@ T is due for sou@@ l-@@ searching of its own .
Mr M@@ a &apos;s ratings have been poor , despite break@@ neck economic growth ; KM@@ T candidates have not wanted to campaign with him .
His un@@ popularity seems to be owing largely to unemployment and the wi@@ dening gap between rich and poor .
A KM@@ T spo@@ kes@@ man says it will re@@ sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le its cab@@ inet as well as its local branches .
The D@@ PP &apos;s strong showing suggests that Taiwan &apos;s support for rap@@ proch@@ ement is limited .
At the same time most Tai@@ wan@@ ese see the economic integration with China as inevitable .
According to Antonio Chi@@ ang , a prominent colum@@ n@@ ist , &quot; the point of no return has already passed . &quot;
Gra@@ m@@ my nom@@ inations : Jazz singer E@@ sper@@ an@@ za Sp@@ al@@ ding is a surprise pick in best new artist category
Per@@ form at the request of a president , and people are bound to take notice .
E@@ sper@@ an@@ za Sp@@ al@@ ding , the 26@@ -@@ year-old jazz b@@ assist and singer hand-@@ picked by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009 , marked one of the Gra@@ mm@@ ys &apos; sur@@ prises this year with a high-@@ profile nom@@ ination in the best new artist category .
Consi@@ dering that Sp@@ al@@ ding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album , &quot; E@@ sper@@ an@@ za , &quot; the nom@@ ination is a bit of a head@@ -@@ scrat@@ cher , but it is consistent with the Gra@@ mm@@ ys &apos; rules of an artist not rele@@ asing more than three alb@@ ums before the recording that &quot; establishes the public identity of that artist . &quot;
Her ambitious 2010 album , &quot; Chamber Music Society , &quot; certainly marked a step forward , and given her ai@@ ri@@ ly inviting vocal style and a de@@ ft hand with pop , funk and Latin influences , it &apos;s possible to draw at least a dot@@ ted line to Sp@@ al@@ ding from Nor@@ ah Jones &apos; run@@ away success in 2003 , the closest equivalent to Gra@@ m@@ my voters looking toward jazz &apos;s neighborhood in this category in recent years .
El@@ sewhere Gra@@ m@@ my voters rightly hon@@ ored the Vi@@ j@@ ay I@@ yer Tri@@ o &apos;s &quot; Histor@@ ic@@ ity &quot; in the instru@@ mental album category , an in@@ vigor@@ ating thri@@ ll@@ -@@ ride of a record that was a critical favorite last year .
Among those I@@ yer will be competing against include veter@@ an sa@@ x@@ op@@ hon@@ ist James Moo@@ dy &apos;s &quot; Moo@@ dy 4@@ B &quot; and key@@ bo@@ ardi@@ st John Be@@ as@@ ley &apos;s &quot; Posi@@ to@@ ot@@ ly . &quot;
Tro@@ mb@@ one Shor@@ ty , a rau@@ c@@ ous New Or@@ le@@ ans favorite and frequent guest on H@@ B@@ O &apos;s &quot; Tre@@ me , &quot; was hon@@ ored in the contemporary jazz category , which otherwise til@@ ts heavily toward fusion with no@@ ds toward alb@@ ums by Stan@@ ley Clar@@ ke , John Mc@@ Lau@@ gh@@ lin and Je@@ ff Lor@@ ber .
The wild , ste@@ amp@@ unk@@ -@@ informed Dar@@ cy James Ar@@ gue &apos;s Secre@@ t Society earned some well-@@ deser@@ ved recognition in the large ens@@ emble category , competing against the Bil@@ ly Chil@@ ds En@@ sem@@ ble &apos;s rich cham@@ ber-@@ jazz and the ever-@@ advent@@ u@@ rous Da@@ ve Holland , whose oc@@ tet &apos;s live album &quot; P@@ ath@@ ways &quot; was a fine example of the b@@ assist &apos;s democratic hand as a band@@ leader .

Pro@@ posed Tem@@ ec@@ ula mos@@ que wins planning commission approval
A proposed mos@@ que in Tem@@ ec@@ ula has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission following more than five hours of often heated public testim@@ ony .
Cri@@ tics as@@ sa@@ iled the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic ti@@ e-@@ ups .
But commission@@ ers ruled Wednesday night the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aes@@ the@@ tically impressive .
&quot; Many good people came to support it - Christians , Jews , Ba@@ ha@@ is , you name it , &quot; said H@@ adi N@@ ael , chair of the Islamic Center of Tem@@ ec@@ ula Valley , speaking Thursday morning .
&quot; I &apos;m proud of that as an American citizen . &quot;
&quot; It shows that justice prev@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; The opposition is very minimal , &quot; he added .
&quot; They just have very loud voices . &quot;
&quot; We have beautiful people in this valley . &quot;
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and la@@ sted until nearly mid@@ night with most of the time taken up with people speaking for or against the center , about even@@ ly divided , according to the Press@@ -@@ Enterprise .
The debate continued on the newspaper &apos;s website .
&quot; There is no more America , &quot; wrote one comm@@ enter .
&quot; It is another Planet of the Ap@@ es with Mis@@ s Liber@@ ty dead in the sand . &quot;
&quot; America has fallen . &quot;
Plan@@ ned Islamic centers also have spark@@ ed protests in other parts of the country , including near ground zero , the site of the S@@ ept . 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in New York City .
In the Tem@@ ec@@ ula Valley , Ima@@ m Mah@@ mou@@ d Har@@ mou@@ sh has den@@ ounced violence .
His con@@ gre@@ gation of about 135 families has co-@@ existed without incident in Ri@@ ver@@ side County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the ware@@ house it r@@ ented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water@@ -@@ fil@@ tration systems .
The new 24@@ ,@@ 9@@ 4@@ 3-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ foot mos@@ que with Medi@@ terran@@ e@@ an-@@ style architecture would include two min@@ are@@ ts and rise as t@@ all as 43 feet .
It would occup@@ y a 4.@@ 3@@ 2-@@ acre site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Cha@@ par@@ ral High School .
O@@ pp@@ on@@ ents can still appeal the project to the City Council .
Ar@@ sen@@ ic-@@ toler@@ ant micro@@ be raises possibility of new types of life on Earth , or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bac@@ teria that can use ar@@ sen@@ ic as one of its nutri@@ ents wi@@ dens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond .
While researchers discovered the unusual bac@@ teria here on Earth , they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential .
&quot; This organ@@ ism has dual capability . &quot;
&quot; It can grow with either pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous or ar@@ sen@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; That makes it very pec@@ uli@@ ar , though it falls short of being some form of truly &apos; alien &apos; life , &quot; comm@@ ented Paul C. W. Davi@@ es of Ari@@ zona State University , a co-@@ author of the report appearing in Thursday &apos;s online edition of the journ@@ al Science .
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life - carbon , hydro@@ gen , nit@@ ro@@ gen , oxy@@ gen , pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us and sul@@ fur .
But the researchers found that the bac@@ teria , discovered in Mon@@ o Lake , Cali@@ f . , is able to continue to grow after sub@@ stit@@ uting ar@@ sen@@ ic for pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous .
&quot; It makes you wonder what else is possible , &quot; said Ari@@ el D. An@@ bar of Ari@@ zona State University , a co-@@ author of the report .
The find is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life , to know what life looks like , An@@ bar said .
The study focuses on a micro@@ be found on Earth .
However , the announcement of a news conference to discuss it , which did not dis@@ close details of the find , generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would dis@@ close the discovery of ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life .
It didn &apos;t .
The discovery &quot; does show that in other plan@@ etary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive bio@@ chem@@ istry and that the &apos; standard &apos; set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed , &quot; comm@@ ented Charles Cock@@ ell , professor at the Plan@@ etary and Space Sciences Research Institute , Open University , in Mil@@ ton Key@@ nes , United Kingdom .
Cock@@ ell was not part of the research team .
&quot; This work is novel because it shows the sub@@ stitution of one element for another in fundamental bio@@ chem@@ istry and bio@@ chemical structure , &quot; added Cock@@ ell .
It wasn &apos;t a chance discovery .
Feli@@ sa Wol@@ fe@@ -S@@ im@@ on of N@@ ASA &apos;s A@@ stro@@ bi@@ ology Institute , who led the study , targeted Mon@@ o Lake because it has high ar@@ sen@@ ic levels .
Ar@@ sen@@ ic and pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous are chem@@ ically similar , so she spec@@ ulated that a micro@@ be exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other .
&quot; Ar@@ sen@@ ic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to that of pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us . &quot;
&quot; As a result , organisms have a hard time telling these elements apart . &quot;
&quot; But ar@@ sen@@ ic is different enough that it doesn &apos;t work as well as pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , so it gets in there and sort of g@@ ums up the works of our bio@@ chemical machinery , &quot; explained An@@ bar .
The researchers collected the bac@@ teria known as G@@ FA@@ J@@ -@@ 1 and exposed it to increasing concent@@ rations of ar@@ sen@@ ic , which it was able to adapt to and grow .
The micro@@ be does grow better on pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous , but showing that it can live with ar@@ sen@@ ic instead raises the possibility that a life form using ar@@ sen@@ ic could occur naturally , either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where ar@@ sen@@ ic is more common .
Jam@@ ie S. Fo@@ ster , an assi@@ stant professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology at the University of Florida , said the idea that ar@@ sen@@ ic could be sub@@ stituted for pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous isn &apos;t new , but there has never been example where it was shown to work .
Ar@@ sen@@ ic was more common in the early times on Earth , she said , so researchers have spec@@ ulated that early life forms might have used it .
&quot; It does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life , not just how life formed on early Earth , &quot; said Fo@@ ster , who was not part of Wol@@ fe@@ -S@@ im@@ on &apos;s research team .
The research was supported by N@@ ASA , the Department of Energy and the National In@@ stitutes of Health .
Rem@@ a@@ ining st@@ olen show dogs found in Comp@@ ton
The remaining two of four show dogs st@@ olen from outside a Bell@@ flower mo@@ tel have been found , Los Angeles County Sher@@ i@@ ff &apos;s officials said Thursday .
The four show dogs - two Ak@@ it@@ as and two P@@ em@@ broke Wel@@ sh cor@@ g@@ is - van@@ ished Tuesday when someone st@@ ole the 2006 Che@@ v@@ ro@@ let Express van they had spent the night in outside a Bell@@ flower Mo@@ tel 6 , authorities said .
Two of the can@@ ines were recover@@ ed Wednesday afternoon , and the remaining two were found late Wednesday evening , said to Steve Whit@@ more , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Los Angeles County Sher@@ i@@ ff &apos;s Department .
&quot; The good news is that the dogs are fine , &quot; said Whit@@ more .
&quot; They are in good condition . &quot;
&quot; They have been returned to their ri@@ ghtful owners . &quot;
Whit@@ more dec@@ lined to say precisely where the dogs were found , in what neighborhood , and the circumstances surrounding their discovery .
&quot; There is an investigation going on . &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t want to say , &quot; Whit@@ more said .
&quot; We are following leads . &quot;
The dogs owners , Kri@@ st@@ ina Ri@@ ck@@ ard and David Pe@@ ek , could not be reached for comment Thursday .
They were re@@ united with their two Ak@@ it@@ as at a coun@@ ty-@@ run animal shel@@ ter in Do@@ w@@ ney on Wednesday afternoon .
Sher@@ i@@ ff &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ties found the van and the two dogs separately in Comp@@ ton .
The Ak@@ it@@ as - Tra@@ ce , a 3-@@ year-old male , and Di@@ di , a 10-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old female - were un@@ har@@ med , authorities said .
But Bun@@ ny and Peter , the cor@@ g@@ is Ri@@ ck@@ ard and Pe@@ ek planned to show at area competitions this week on behalf of the dogs &apos; Japanese owners , remained missing until their discovering late Wednesday .
Pe@@ ek and Ri@@ ck@@ ard , who live in Red@@ ding , are in town for the AK@@ C / Eu@@ kan@@ uba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend , where they planned to show Tra@@ ce .
The other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AK@@ C / Eu@@ kan@@ uba show , Pe@@ ek told The Times on Wednesday .
Southern California is one stop on the couple &apos;s nearly mon@@ th-@@ long tour of dog shows .
On Monday night , Pe@@ ek and Ri@@ ck@@ ard checked into the mo@@ tel .
They often stay in mot@@ els and park their van right outside their room window .
They brought three other dogs - a Bo@@ xer pu@@ ppy , a Par@@ son Rus@@ sell terri@@ er and a B@@ ritt@@ any - which stayed with them in the mo@@ tel room .
But they left the thi@@ ck-@@ fur@@ red Ak@@ it@@ as and cor@@ g@@ is in the van where it would be cool@@ er .
They opened the windows a bit , so the dogs could get fresh air .
Pe@@ ek and Ri@@ ck@@ ard reported the van st@@ olen at 6 a.m. Tuesday .
Pe@@ ek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the cor@@ g@@ is , which are im@@ plan@@ ted with micro@@ chips to identify them .
It was unclear Thursday whether an award would be given .
L@@ ion ready to ro@@ ar again as M@@ GM restructuring gets final court go@@ -@@ ahead
After 18 months of tur@@ mo@@ il and uncertainty , M@@ GM has finally gotten a green light to start ane@@ w .
A New York federal bank@@ rupt@@ cy judge on Thursday officially bl@@ essed the &quot; pre-@@ pack@@ aged &quot; plan by credi@@ tors to wi@@ pe out about $ 5 billion in debt , cle@@ aring the way for the 8@@ 6-@@ year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and rele@@ asing movies and television shows .
With Thursday &apos;s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bank@@ rupt@@ cy code , no more legal obstacles remain for M@@ GM to rela@@ unch under Spy@@ glass Entertainment fo@@ under@@ s G@@ ary Bar@@ ber and Ro@@ ger Bir@@ n@@ baum , who will become chief exec@@ u@@ tives of what will be a s@@ lim@@ me@@ d-@@ down studio .
The staff will drop to about 3@@ 20 from over 400 .
M@@ GM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JP@@ Morgan Ch@@ ase clo@@ ses a planned $ 500@@ -@@ million loan facility to fund the new M@@ GM &apos;s operations and productions .
It is currently being syn@@ dic@@ ated by the investment bank - which is itself ki@@ cking in $ 75 million - and is expected to be funded by mid-@@ December .
The studio &apos;s restructuring process began in May 2009 , when investment bank Mo@@ eli@@ s &amp; Co. was hi@@ red to advise management on how to fix its finances as it was stru@@ ggling to afford interest payments of $ 300 million per year .
That August , Chief Executive Harry Slo@@ an was replaced by Stephen Co@@ oper , a former CEO of En@@ ron and a turn@@ around expert known for his work at Kris@@ p@@ y Kre@@ me Dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts .
Mo@@ eli@@ s &apos; and Co@@ oper &apos;s attempts to resolve M@@ GM &apos;s financial wo@@ es and satisfy the studio &apos;s 14@@ 0-@@ plus credi@@ tors took much longer than expected .
After several months of discussions , the parties agreed in late 2009 to put the company up for sale .
However , the auction attracted few bi@@ d@@ ders and none willing to pay the $ 2 billi@@ on-@@ plus that credi@@ tors were seeking .
By the spring of this year , it was back to the drawing board as the M@@ GM team began working on a restructuring plan that , after months of debate and internal dis@@ agreements , was finally endorsed by credi@@ tors in late October .
When M@@ GM officially emer@@ ges from bank@@ rupt@@ cy in the coming weeks , Mo@@ eli@@ s and Co@@ oper &apos;s firms will receive mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on-@@ dollar bon@@ uses for their work .
Mo@@ eli@@ s &amp; Co . , which has already received $ 1.2 million , will get a $ 9.@@ 5-@@ million payment .
Co@@ oper &apos;s firms , which have been collecting $ 3@@ 7@@ 5,000 per month for their services running the company , will receive a $ 4-@@ million &quot; success fee . &quot;
Bar@@ ber and Bir@@ n@@ baum plan to re@@ start production at M@@ GM , which released only one movie this year , and put together an annual s@@ late of seven or eight films that will come out starting in 2012 .
They also plan to co-@@ finance two movies based on &quot; The Hob@@ bit , &quot; along with War@@ ner Bro@@ s .
The studio needs to close a separate loan of between $ 26@@ 5 million and $ 2@@ 75 million to fund its portion of those two movies , which are to be directed by Peter Jackson .
Invest@@ or Carl I@@ c@@ ahn , who own@@ s about 18 % of M@@ GM &apos;s debt , had been seeking to arrange a mer@@ ger of the studio with Li@@ ons Gate Entertainment , in which he is the largest share@@ holder .
However , recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in a deal .
Tech To@@ ys to Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
While the leading candidate for this year &apos;s most mar@@ vel@@ ous to@@ y is the i@@ Pad , followed by , perhaps , a Microsoft Kin@@ ect video game system , both can put a significant dent in your gift budget .
Consi@@ der that for the price of one i@@ Pad , you can buy five $ 99 BM@@ X bicy@@ cles , and that one Kin@@ ect game costs the same as 10 classic be@@ aded jump rop@@ es , or about 48 cans of Pla@@ y-@@ Do@@ h .
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance .
I recently visited three national to@@ y s@@ ellers - a Wal@@ -@@ Mar@@ t , a To@@ ys &quot; R &quot; Us and a B@@ J &apos;s W@@ hol@@ es@@ ale Club - to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $ 80 .
It was immediately clear that Mo@@ ore &apos;s Law has been at work ; this year &apos;s technology to@@ y is likely to have more power , while co@@ sting the same if not a bit less compared with last year &apos;s .
In addition , while there are generally fewer new toys with associated Web sites , two of the most well known of this type , Web@@ kin@@ z and Club Pen@@ gu@@ in , have more offer@@ ings .
And but@@ t@@ on-@@ cell powered toys are increasing , as well as toys with rech@@ ar@@ g@@ able batteries .
Here are some recommendations .
( All prices are from To@@ ys &quot; R &quot; Us , except if otherwise noted . )
S@@ ing-@@ a-@@ ma-@@ j@@ ig@@ s ( Mat@@ tel , $ 13 , for ages 3 and up ) are gu@@ ine@@ a pig@@ -@@ sized pl@@ ush toys that sing a note when you squ@@ ee@@ ze their bel@@ lies .
One squ@@ ee@@ ze equ@@ als one note , and a second squ@@ ee@@ ze starts building a song .
If you buy more than one , they &apos;ll sing in harmony .
Cau@@ tion : Once you start squ@@ ee@@ zing , you can &apos;t stop .
For singing combined with dancing , D@@ ance Star Mi@@ ckey ( Fisher@@ -@@ Price , $ 60 , for ages 2 and up ) is the best choice .
Bor@@ ro@@ wing on last year &apos;s El@@ mo Live technology , the 14-@@ inch anim@@ at@@ ron@@ ic dol@@ l plays tur@@ n-@@ taking games like Simon Sa@@ ys , and can moon walk , thanks to his innovative h@@ ing@@ ed feet with lo@@ cking wheels .
Children testing the to@@ y used Mi@@ ckey as a dance instruc@@ tor although their parents compla@@ ined about the lack of a volume control .
If you &apos;re a child of the &apos; 8@@ 0s , you may recall Al@@ ph@@ ie , one of the first computer@@ ized educational toys .
He &apos;s back , ( Has@@ br@@ o / Play@@ sk@@ ool , $ 40 , for ages 3 and up ) , with a back@@ pack full of qui@@ z cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-@@ correc@@ ting , wis@@ ec@@ ra@@ cking work@@ book .
If you &apos;re le@@ ery of hand@@ ing your child your sm@@ art@@ phone , here are three stand@@ -@@ alone alternatives .
V@@ Tech &apos;s Mob@@ i@@ Go ( $ 60 , for ages 3 to 8 ) is the che@@ ap@@ est and easi@@ est to use , featuring a q@@ wer@@ ty keyboard , although the games don &apos;t teach as effectively as the Le@@ ap@@ ster Explorer ( $ 70 , for ages 3 to 12 ) , Le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g &apos;s first major over@@ hau@@ l of the Le@@ ap@@ ster line , with a ne@@ wer , bri@@ ghter screen .
Neither version is compatible with older car@@ tri@@ dges .
Fisher@@ -@@ Price &apos;s i@@ X@@ L ( $ 90 , for ages 3 to 7 ) uses an i@@ Tun@@ es-@@ like system to deliver games and e-@@ books , and has an SD card slot that makes it possible to display family photos .
Finally , S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble Flash ( $ 30 , Has@@ br@@ o , for ages 8 and up ) is a set of five blocks just larger than a book of matches , each with its own LED screen .
The goal is to make words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out ; it &apos;s great for an impro@@ mp@@ tu sp@@ elling contest .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , toys have some sort of online connection .
Based on their presence in to@@ y stores alone , the two largest are Web@@ kin@@ z and Club Pen@@ gu@@ in .
To buy your child an online pet in Club Pen@@ gu@@ in , for example , you can get a Disney Club Pen@@ gu@@ in 2 &quot; Mix &apos; N Mat@@ ch Fig@@ ure Pack , $ 5 , for ages 6 to 12 ) that includes a coin with a hidden code .
When you re@@ de@@ em the code online , your child is given enough credits in the Club Pen@@ gu@@ in store for any two items .
These might include ro@@ ller sk@@ ates or a pet Pu@@ ff@@ le to@@ y .
S@@ ligh@@ tly larger than the bri@@ st@@ le-@@ end of your to@@ o@@ th@@ brush , H@@ ex@@ bug N@@ ano ( $ 10 , for ages 5 and up ) is the latest in a line of but@@ t@@ on-@@ cell powered micro-@@ robots .
The f@@ aux bug moves quickly on 12 vi@@ br@@ ating si@@ lic@@ on legs , in random directions .
It is fun to make a ma@@ ze out of blocks to see if it can find its way through .
It &apos;s du@@ rable , too .
O@@ urs was able to drop off the kitchen table and even spent some time inside our dog &apos;s mouth .
Br@@ ing@@ ing a So@@ fter Si@@ de to Po@@ lic@@ ing in China
Like an urban dri@@ ll ser@@ ge@@ ant , T@@ ang S@@ hen@@ bin pac@@ ed on a city square , st@@ ern@@ ly inspec@@ ting his ner@@ vous charges , issuing s@@ otto vo@@ ce commands with military authority .
He wanted the female members of ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an - China &apos;s bur@@ ly enfor@@ c@@ ers of urban order , fe@@ ared and des@@ p@@ ised for their cap@@ ri@@ cious cra@@ ck@@ down@@ s and pen@@ chant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a cl@@ ut@@ ch of on@@ lo@@ ok@@ ers .
&quot; Stand straight ! &quot;
&quot; Look sharp ! &quot;
Show them , he wh@@ is@@ pered , &quot; what pretty girls are like ! &quot;
Four bare@@ ly-@@ past@@ -@@ teen@@ age girls in white glo@@ ves and identical olive jack@@ ets and pan@@ ts sn@@ apped to attention .
Four pa@@ irs of black pumps lined up rul@@ er-@@ straight .
Four pri@@ m h@@ ats per@@ ched perfectly at@@ op hair bound in blue and white stri@@ ped bo@@ ws .
&quot; Person@@ ally , I think they are aver@@ age-@@ looking , &quot; Mr. T@@ ang said , dis@@ mis@@ sively .
&quot; Mod@@ els are pretty . &quot;
More than one government has tried to brush up the image of China &apos;s urban inspec@@ tors .
One city mand@@ ated that all new recru@@ its have a college degree .
Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Province changed the gra@@ y-@@ green uni@@ forms to a supposedly more inviting blue .
Wu@@ han , in central China , sub@@ stituted sta@@ re-@@ down@@ s for stron@@ g-@@ ar@@ ming : in 2009 , one report stated , 50 officers en@@ cir@@ c@@ led a wa@@ y@@ ward snack car@@ t , glo@@ wer@@ ing ste@@ adily for a half hour until the pe@@ dd@@ ler packed up and left .
X@@ in@@ du , an urban district of 6@@ 80@@ ,000 in Ch@@ eng@@ du , has chosen major image surgery .
Since 2003 , the district has supple@@ mented its urban street police with 13 women , specifically chosen for their looks , sha@@ pel@@ iness and youth .
The idea is to give the rou@@ gh@@ -@@ he@@ wn police a so@@ fter , femin@@ ine side .
Unfortunately , even S@@ car@@ le@@ tt Joh@@ ans@@ son might struggle to raise China &apos;s sub@@ terranean regard for these city squ@@ ads .
And for good reason , critics would argue .
Unlike the police , these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordin@@ ances by imposing fines and other administrative penalties .
But the Chinese news media rout@@ inely portra@@ y a different reality .
In January 2008 , Hu@@ bei Province inspec@@ tors beat a b@@ yst@@ ander to death after he used his cell@@ phone to film them breaking up a protest against a waste du@@ mp .
Last year , a training manual for Beijing inspec@@ tors , pil@@ fer@@ ed and posted online , described how to effectively th@@ ra@@ sh offen@@ ders without drawing blood .
This year , a Shanghai water@@ mel@@ on pe@@ dd@@ ler was left bra@@ in-@@ damaged after a s@@ cu@@ ff@@ le with five officers .
One viol@@ en@@ ce-@@ so@@ aked video game , available for download online , features Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ trained inspec@@ tors who ass@@ ault street vend@@ ors .
&quot; Ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an has scar@@ red the government , &quot; China Da@@ ily , a national publication , l@@ ament@@ ed last year after yet another contro@@ vers@@ y over tac@@ tics .
The paper demanded a &quot; truly thorough cle@@ an-@@ up . &quot;
Skep@@ tics say the approach here falls far short of that .
After the district adverti@@ sed for eight new female recru@@ its in October , an edi@@ torial in The Beijing E@@ ven@@ ing News ques@@ tioned whether the women had actual duties or were simply scenic di@@ versions .
The answer appears to be a little of both .
The district &apos;s adverti@@ sement called for female applicants 18 to 22 years old , with a good figure and &quot; the five fac@@ ial features in proper order . &quot;
They should be abo@@ ve-@@ average height - t@@ aller than 1.@@ 6 meters or 5 feet , 2 ½ in@@ ches .
Re@@ ti@@ rement at age 26 is mandatory .
Off@@ ici@@ als said the job was physi@@ cally too ar@@ du@@ ous for women over 25 .
&quot; Their image is the important thing , &quot; one un@@ named district official told Red@@ net@@ .com , a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ governmental Web site .
&quot; First , the candidates &apos; external qualities will determine if they make the cut , such as height , weight , fac@@ ial features , etc . &quot;
Next comes tem@@ per@@ ament and &quot; inner qualities . &quot;
F@@ em@@ ale ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an are like flower v@@ ases , he said , adding , &quot; Besides being v@@ ases , they will have other responsibilities . &quot;
Z@@ hen@@ g L@@ ih@@ ua , the dep@@ uty director of the district &apos;s city management bure@@ au , is not e@@ ager to endorse that description .
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job adverti@@ sements for both sex@@ es .
So is the demand for or@@ derly fac@@ ial features .

They do not object to their limited ten@@ ure either , they said , because they har@@ bor career ambitions greater than simply sh@@ oo@@ ing vend@@ ors into the alle@@ y@@ ways where they are supposed to con@@ fine their business .
Every morning , the squ@@ ad faces off against a do@@ zen or so pe@@ dd@@ lers who dar@@ t around on foot or bicycle , trying to sell as many b@@ uns or bow@@ ls of to@@ fu as possible before they are run off .

&quot; It is pretty much the same every day , &quot; said Hu@@ ang J@@ ing , 20 , who studies marketing in her off hours .
&quot; Very routine . &quot;
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counter@@ parts to conf@@ is@@ c@@ ate vend@@ ors &apos; goods .
They can only threaten to report viol@@ ators to their male super@@ vis@@ ors .
That tends to shi@@ eld them from the sudden public displays of anim@@ osity against offici@@ al@@ dom that are common throughout China .
This year hundreds of citizens in Kun@@ ming , the Y@@ un@@ n@@ an provin@@ cial capital , ri@@ oted after false rum@@ ors spread that ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an officers had killed a vend@@ or .

But calm is hardly guaranteed .
Just two blocks from plac@@ id Ba@@ o@@ gu@@ ang Square , where the female officers pat@@ rolled that morning , more than 50 people gathered on a street corner .

Like the female officers , the coordin@@ ators - men age 40 or over - play a purely suppor@@ tive role .

&quot; Sometimes we fight verb@@ ally . &quot;

Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors won &apos;t charge Sen@@ ator En@@ sign
Justice Department prosec@@ ut@@ ors have cle@@ ared Sen@@ ator John En@@ sign of criminal alleg@@ ations arising from his affair with a former campaign ai@@ de and his efforts to secure lob@@ b@@ ying work for the woman &apos;s husband , the sen@@ ator &apos;s lawyers announced Wednesday .
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Mr. En@@ sign , the Nevada Republi@@ can who was considered a possible Republi@@ can presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal over his affair made national head@@ lines last year and damaged his career .
Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s office said he was &quot; certainly pleased &quot; by the decision , which followed a year@@ long investigation .
The sen@@ ator could still face disciplinary action by the Sen@@ ate ethics committee .
Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s lawyers said the Justice Department had &quot; informed us that Sen@@ ator En@@ sign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring any charges against him in this matter . &quot;
The Justice Department dec@@ lined to comment on the case .
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department , who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Mr. En@@ sign may have con@@ spi@@ red to viol@@ ate a criminal ban on federal lob@@ b@@ ying .
Inter@@ views , e-mail and other documents first dis@@ closed in October 2009 in The New York Times indicated that Mr. En@@ sign had helped Dou@@ glas Hamp@@ ton , who was one of his ai@@ des , secure lu@@ cra@@ tive lob@@ b@@ ying work to win the silence of Mr. Hamp@@ ton and his wife , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia , about the sen@@ ator &apos;s affair with her .
Mr@@ s. Hamp@@ ton once served as treas@@ urer of an En@@ sign campaign .
Mr. En@@ sign cont@@ acted a number of political back@@ ers to find work for Mr. Hamp@@ ton and then advoc@@ ated on their behalf after they had hi@@ red Mr. Hamp@@ ton to lobby for them , according to the documents and interviews .
Because Mr. Hamp@@ ton had recently been an ai@@ de to Mr. En@@ sign , he was bar@@ red by law from lob@@ b@@ ying his former emplo@@ yer or the Sen@@ ate as a whole for a year .
Eth@@ ics experts said the unusual arrangement between Mr. En@@ sign and Mr. Hamp@@ ton , who were close friends before the affair , appeared at od@@ ds with the so-called revol@@ ving door lob@@ b@@ ying ban .
From the evidence that has been made public , &quot; there appeared to be a pri@@ ma fac@@ ie case of a con@@ spi@@ racy to viol@@ ate , and substantial violation of the revol@@ ving door statute , &quot; said Stan@@ ley Brand , a Washington lawyer who speciali@@ zes in defending clients investigated by the government .
While Justice Department officials dec@@ lined to explain the reason@@ ing behind the decision in the En@@ sign case , Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared war@@ y of taking on political prosec@@ utions after a number of high-@@ profile set@@ backs for its public integrity section , including the decision last year to drop the prosec@@ ution against former Sen@@ ator T@@ ed Ste@@ vens am@@ id charges of prosec@@ ut@@ orial mis@@ conduct .
Federal prosec@@ ut@@ ors &quot; are clearly gun sh@@ y , &quot; said Mel@@ an@@ ie Slo@@ an , the executive director of Citizens for Respon@@ sibility and Eth@@ ics in Washington , an advoc@@ acy group that brought several complaints against Mr. En@@ sign in the case .
&quot; This basically says high-@@ ranking government officials can now assume the laws don &apos;t apply to them , &quot; she added .
Paul Co@@ gg@@ ins , Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s lead lawyer , said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosec@@ utor on Monday and a follow-up the next day , telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client .
Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s defense team had been co@@ operating with prosec@@ ut@@ ors in trying to persuade them that the sen@@ ator , as his office reiter@@ ated in a statement Wednesday , &quot; acted in accordance with the law . &quot;
Mr. Co@@ gg@@ ins dec@@ lined to spell out the legal arguments he made to prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; I &apos;m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except to say that we think they made the right decision , &quot; he said .
Last month , the Federal Ele@@ ction Commission decided to drop an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group alleg@@ ing that a $ 9@@ 6@@ ,000 payment from Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s parents to the Hamp@@ tons violated federal election law .
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was anything except a gift .
One company for which Mr. En@@ sign helped Mr. Hamp@@ ton find lob@@ b@@ ying work was N@@ V Energy , a major Nevada company that had long supported the sen@@ ator .
One e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company brought Mr. Hamp@@ ton on as a lob@@ by@@ ist , Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s chief of staff , John L@@ op@@ ez , communic@@ ated with Mr. Hamp@@ ton and told him that he was &quot; po@@ und@@ ing &quot; the Inter@@ ior Department over an issue in dispute .
Mr. En@@ sign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hamp@@ ton and another Nevada client , Al@@ legi@@ ant Air , and called the transportation secre@@ tary to set up a meeting on the airline &apos;s behalf after it had hi@@ red Mr. Hamp@@ ton to do lob@@ b@@ ying work .
When news of the affair first sur@@ faced last year , Mr. En@@ sign ap@@ ologi@@ zed to his constitu@@ ents and re@@ signed his position as the four@@ th-@@ ranking Republi@@ can leader in the Sen@@ ate .
After keeping a low profile for many months , Mr. En@@ sign told re@@ por@@ ters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Sen@@ ate .
In announ@@ cing that Mr. En@@ sign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation , his spo@@ kes@@ woman , J@@ enni@@ fer Co@@ oper , said the sen@@ ator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department &apos;s lead and end its inquiry .
&quot; Sen@@ ator En@@ sign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada , &quot; she said .
Ch@@ es@@ hire Ap@@ pe@@ al Will Point to Twitter
There were half a do@@ zen of them typ@@ ing away in the cour@@ tro@@ om rows .
Minute by minute , they sent out reports of gru@@ es@@ ome testim@@ ony via Twitter .
In the end , the defense says , there were more than 14@@ 0@@ ,000 Twitter messages about the trial that dealt with rap@@ e and children tied to their beds in a house that was set ab@@ la@@ ze .
On Thursday , the widely followed trial of Ste@@ ven J. Ha@@ yes , who was convi@@ cted of killing three members of a Ch@@ es@@ hire , Con@@ n . , family , is set to come to an official end with the judge &apos;s im@@ position of the death sentence voted for by the jury .
But lawyers for Mr. Ha@@ yes have already made court fil@@ ings that sk@@ etch out appe@@ als arguments that are likely to occup@@ y the courts for years .
One of the most pro@@ voc@@ ative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including main@@ stream re@@ por@@ ters &apos; extensive use of Twitter - created a &quot; cir@@ cus atmosphere &quot; and such widespread , instant sat@@ u@@ ration with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory details that the jury was impro@@ per@@ ly s@@ wa@@ yed by public pas@@ sions .
The claim could force appe@@ als judges to gra@@ pp@@ le with the question of whether new technology requires new cour@@ tro@@ om rules .
&quot; As I experienced it during this trial , I think there &apos;s a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the cour@@ tro@@ om is affecting an individual &apos;s fair@@ -@@ trial rights , &quot; said Thomas J. U@@ ll@@ mann , Mr. Ha@@ yes &apos;s chief defense lawyer .
The trial judge , J@@ on C. Blue of State Superior Court , ter@@ sely rejected the claims in a ruling last week , saying that the news media were &quot; carefully controlled &quot; and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .
But that is not likely to be the last word on the issue .
For decades , appe@@ als courts have recognized that coverage of not@@ orious cases can raise questions about a trial &apos;s fair@@ ness .
In a land@@ mark 1966 ruling , the United States Supreme Court over@@ turned the conviction of a Cle@@ vel@@ and o@@ ste@@ op@@ ath , Dr. S@@ am Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d , for the murder of his wife , saying in its decision , Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d v. Max@@ well , that there was a &quot; car@@ ni@@ val atmosphere at trial &quot; because of the news media .
The crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie &quot; The Fu@@ gi@@ tive . &quot;
Some lawyers said appe@@ als courts re@@ viewing Mr. Ha@@ yes &apos;s conviction half a century later might be in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by the argument that new rules could be necessary to go@@ vern ways of communic@@ ating from cour@@ tro@@ oms uni@@ mag@@ ined at the time of Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d &apos;s case .
&quot; There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media &quot; in high-@@ profile trials , said John J. Don@@ oh@@ ue III , a Stan@@ ford Law School professor who studied the Connec@@ tic@@ ut death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitr@@ arily enforced .
Professor Don@@ oh@@ ue said some appe@@ als judges might be in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by the idea that limiting instant communication from cour@@ tro@@ oms might make trials fairer .
The Twitter issue is just one of many outlined by Mr. Ha@@ yes &apos;s lawyers that are likely to be argued for years , dela@@ ying an execution .
The defense lawyers also claim , for example , that Mr. Ha@@ yes may have been prejudi@@ ced when Ju@@ dge Blue dec@@ lined to allow them to test potential jur@@ ors &apos; reactions by showing them gr@@ is@@ ly cri@@ me@@ -@@ scene photographs during jury selection .
Some of the jur@@ ors have said they were horri@@ fied by the photographs of the victims , J@@ enni@@ fer Ha@@ w@@ ke-@@ Peti@@ t , 48 , and her dau@@ gh@@ ters , Ha@@ y@@ ley , 17 , and Mich@@ a@@ ela , 11 .
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitu@@ tionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wron@@ g@@ ly removed a ju@@ ror who had been critical of prosec@@ ut@@ ors and that he impro@@ per@@ ly added pressure for a verdi@@ ct by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliber@@ ate over a weekend .
The jur@@ ors were not sequ@@ est@@ ered .
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest .
They noted in a challenge to the verdi@@ ct filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connec@@ tic@@ ut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for govern@@ or and the United States Sen@@ ate .
They argued that the news media continually f@@ ann@@ ed the fl@@ ames of emo@@ tion about the case .
&quot; The daily cr@@ ush of media t@@ we@@ ets , cameras and re@@ por@@ ters outside the cour@@ thouse , &quot; the lawyers wrote , &quot; was unlike anything ever seen here in New Ha@@ ven and maybe stat@@ e@@ wide . &quot;
Their focus on the Twitter coverage is controversial .
In interviews , some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incen@@ di@@ ary than reports delivered more slowly was a Lud@@ di@@ te view that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials .
But some lawyers said appe@@ als courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts .
Mr. Ha@@ yes &apos;s lawyers are pressing that claim .
In their fil@@ ing , they referred to the Supreme Court &apos;s 1966 decision over@@ turning Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d &apos;s conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media required new rules .
&quot; This case , &quot; they wrote , &quot; represents the Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d v. Max@@ well of the 21st century . &quot;
Can civili@@ ty bridge the divide ?
After a campaign notable for inv@@ ective and neg@@ ativity , a mo@@ dic@@ um of civili@@ ty has broken out in Washington this week .
Is it a har@@ b@@ inger of genuine bi@@ parti@@ san cooperation ahead or an ill@@ us@@ ory moment before a quick return to parti@@ san combat in the capital ?
Tuesday &apos;s meeting between President Obama and con@@ gres@@ sional leaders produced no break@@ throu@@ ghs on the big issues that must be dealt with during the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k session .
But by all accounts , it was at least a polite discussion of the two sides &apos; differences as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to go@@ vern , rather than another empty episode of parti@@ san point sc@@ oring .
Wednesday &apos;s public meeting of the president &apos;s deficit commission was equally civili@@ zed , despite the policy differences that remain among the members .
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months produced a mutual respect that tran@@ sc@@ ends the ideological gul@@ f that still separ@@ ates the members .
That &apos;s hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived .
Both sides are now in a period of testing - prob@@ ing one another for signs of co@@ oper@@ ati@@ veness and compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voters &apos; pati@@ ence for renewed parti@@ san war@@ fare .
Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the participants &apos; reviews of it after@@ ward were done with a minimum of demands or accus@@ ations .
The philosophi@@ cal differences between Obama and the Republi@@ cans are too large and too deeply held to suggest any quick change in the climate that existed during the past two years .
Whether the issue is taxes , spending , health care or enti@@ t@@ lements , the two sides remain miles apart .
Still , the November election has tem@@ pered Washington , at least in the short term .
&quot; There &apos;s no question that ton@@ ally things have changed , &quot; said Pe@@ te W@@ eh@@ ner , a Bush administration official now with the Eth@@ ics and Public Policy Center .
&quot; Those are inevitable after elections .
Ele@@ ctions ar@@ ouse parti@@ san pas@@ sions , and then they die down .
That is good . &quot;
On some issues , particularly those on the agenda for the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k session , Republi@@ cans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution .
The Bush tax cuts exp@@ ire at the end of the year , and nobody favor@@ s that .
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them , permanently or temporarily .
Similarly , compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits , if only because Republi@@ cans can &apos;t afford to look like they favor tax cuts for the weal@@ thy while den@@ ying j@@ ob@@ less workers unemployment compensation .
After Tuesday &apos;s meeting at the White House , there is greater optim@@ ism for a possible deal on these issues during the l@@ ame duc@@ k session , along with ratification of the New ST@@ ART pact .
But William Gal@@ ston of the Bro@@ ok@@ ings Institution cau@@ tions that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k session will not necessarily lead to continued bi@@ parti@@ san@@ ship when the new 1@@ 12th Congress conven@@ es in January .
Instead , he said , a period of dis@@ agreement is likely , even inevitable .
&quot; After things that have to get done get done , the psych@@ ology in the short term will rever@@ t to one of confron@@ tation , &quot; he said .
W@@ eh@@ ner , too , expressed skep@@ ticism - which is widely shared - that civili@@ ty will lead to real cooperation .
&quot; I view most of what happens between now and 2012 as an under@@ card , or shadow bo@@ xing , to the main event in 2012 , &quot; he said .
The reasons have much to do with the ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p of the new Republi@@ can majority in the House and the tea party voters who were instru@@ mental in creating it .
However min@@ d@@ ful Republi@@ can leaders are of the dangers of over@@ playing their hand , they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut government spending and repe@@ al the new heal@@ th-@@ care law .
Those parti@@ san lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission recommendations , which include reform@@ ing the tax code and raising some taxes , raising the retirement age and cutting spending .
Co-@@ chairs Alan Simp@@ son and Er@@ sk@@ ine Bow@@ les have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have , in their own estim@@ ation , forced the issue of the deficit onto the public agenda in ways that can &apos;t be ignored .
But they need 14 votes on the 18-@@ member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation , and they have been stru@@ ggling to get anywhere close to that number .
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel , sugge@@ sting that on fiscal issues there is , today at least , little grounds for or desire for compromise .
Gal@@ ston predic@@ ts two phases in the batt@@ les between the White House and con@@ gres@@ sional Republi@@ cans .
The first will come next year in the form of parti@@ san clas@@ hes , as Republi@@ cans challenge Obama on the budget , taxes and health care , followed later by a period of greater bi@@ parti@@ san cooperation .
What would cause the shift ?
Public opinion .
There is considerable evidence that , despite the parti@@ san@@ ship of the recent election , a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together .
If confron@@ tation leads to stal@@ em@@ ate , as it did in 1995 , then both parties will be carefully watching the public reaction .
W@@ ho@@ ever is judged to be losing is likely to shift course and seek compromise .
That , however , may be an optimistic view .
Parti@@ san@@ ship and pol@@ ari@@ zation are greater today than they were in the mid-@@ 1990s , and there appears to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and con@@ gres@@ sional Republi@@ cans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republi@@ cans then .
At the same time , activists in both parties see 2010 as mere pre@@ lu@@ de to a more consequ@@ ential election in 2012 .
Given that reality , the civili@@ ty on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans .
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them .
Le@@ aked U.S. document portra@@ ys Moscow as haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a &quot; kle@@ p@@ to@@ cracy , &quot; and it passes on a portion of the bri@@ bes and protection money it collec@@ ts all the way to the Krem@@ lin , the U.S. Emb@@ assy in Russia reported in a mem@@ o in February .
Both the police and the Federal Security Service run huge protection ra@@ ckets that help account for the high cost of living in Moscow , it said .
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but from organized criminal groups as well .
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister V@@ ladimir Putin has ter@@ med the &quot; vertical of authority &quot; - takes its cut as the money moves up the lad@@ der .
The mem@@ o , which was sent to Washington under the name of Amb@@ assador John Be@@ y@@ r@@ le , was posted by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks on its Web site Wednesday .
The mem@@ o is based on sources whose names have been red@@ acted .
It was written while Y@@ ur@@ i Lu@@ zh@@ kov was still Moscow &apos;s may@@ or , and it bl@@ ames him for much of the corruption .
He was fi@@ red in October by President D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev , but there has been little evidence of a clean@@ up since then .
Lu@@ zh@@ kov and his wife , Y@@ el@@ ena Bat@@ ur@@ ina , who own@@ s a prominent construction firm , have consistently denied corruption accus@@ ations over the years , and he has won several li@@ bel suits over such accus@@ ations .
In September he told a Russian television station , when asked about a documentary sugge@@ sting he was corrupt : &quot; It is mad , it is fil@@ th , it is a m@@ ess . &quot;
Russians overwhel@@ m@@ ingly believe that thei@@ rs is a corrupt society , p@@ olls have shown .
But it is unusual to find the partic@@ ul@@ ars sp@@ elled out as they were in the emb@@ assy &apos;s report , and it is un@@ heard of that it should be diplom@@ ats from a foreign country doing so .
&quot; The Moscow city government &apos;s direct links to crimin@@ ality have led some to call it &apos; dy@@ s@@ functional , &apos; and to asser@@ t that the government operates more as a kle@@ p@@ to@@ cracy than a government , &quot; the mem@@ o says .
&quot; Criminal elements enjoy a &apos; k@@ ry@@ sh@@ a &apos; ( a term from the criminal / ma@@ fia world literally meaning &apos; roof &apos; or protection ) that runs through the police , the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ministry of Internal Affairs ( M@@ V@@ D ) , and the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , as well as throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy .
&quot; An@@ alyst@@ s identify a three-@@ ti@@ ered structure in Moscow &apos;s criminal world . &quot;
&quot; Lu@@ zh@@ kov is at the top . &quot;
&quot; The FS@@ B , M@@ V@@ D and mili@@ tia are at the second level . &quot;
&quot; Finally , ordinary criminals and corrupt inspec@@ tors are at the lowest level . &quot;
&quot; This is an in@@ efficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city is not providing some services . &quot;
The report says that the FS@@ B ra@@ kes in money from the biggest firms , and that the police target small businesses .
One source , it said , &quot; explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the M@@ V@@ D and FS@@ B ( rather than organized crime groups ) since they not only have more g@@ uns , resources , and power than criminal groups , but they are also protected by the law . &quot;
&quot; For this reason , protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand . &quot;
The mem@@ o notes that , while the collection of money is comprehensive , the protection itself can be spot@@ ty ; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest .
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses shut down on one pretext or another .
Med@@ ve@@ dev has talked several times about fighting corruption but has admitted that he has made little head@@ way .
The emb@@ assy mem@@ o rela@@ ys reports of men taking su@@ it@@ cases , pre@@ sum@@ ably stu@@ ff@@ ed with cash , into the Krem@@ lin itself .
&quot; In his fight against corruption , Med@@ ve@@ dev has to rely on bureau@@ crats , &quot; Geor@@ gy Sat@@ aro@@ v , director of the Moscow think tank Indem , said in a recent interview .
&quot; But he is a part of this bureaucracy . &quot;
&quot; He is not part of a political class , because a political class doesn &apos;t exist in Russia anymore . &quot;
Without politics , without an opposition , without a separation of powers , he said , corruption is inevitable .
Nation@@ wide , Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $ 300 billion a year .
The country was ran@@ ked 15@@ 4th in a recent survey on global perc@@ ep@@ tions of corruption by the non@@ governmental organization Transpar@@ ency International ( countries are ran@@ ked from least to most corrupt ) .
The dis@@ closure of the U.S. Emb@@ assy mem@@ o , which didn &apos;t occur until late evening Moscow time , is sure to sti@@ r disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure within the Russian government , although to the extent that Lu@@ zh@@ kov can be bl@@ amed for Moscow &apos;s fail@@ ings , it might be an opportunity for the Krem@@ lin to argue that it is solving the problem .
Inter@@ viewed for CN@@ N by Lar@@ ry King , Putin suggested that the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks documents may be fabri@@ c@@ ations and re@@ acted an@@ gri@@ ly to a dis@@ closure that U.S. diplom@@ ats had called him Bat@@ man to Med@@ ve@@ dev &apos;s Rob@@ in .
&quot; The truth of the matter is , this is about our interaction , which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country , &quot; he said .
&quot; But to be honest with you , we didn &apos;t suspect that this would be done with such arrogan@@ ce , with such a push and , you know , being so un@@ eth@@ ically done . &quot;
Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge veter@@ ans forced to confront the past
In a di@@ mly ligh@@ ted concrete class@@ room with smu@@ dged and pe@@ eling walls , the principal of An@@ long Ven@@ g High School rec@@ alled the man who had built it , the late Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge leader T@@ a Mo@@ k .
&quot; Everyone here lo@@ ves T@@ a Mo@@ k . &quot;
&quot; He was a good leader , and he c@@ ared about his people , &quot; said S@@ ren@@ g K@@ or M@@ a , 42 .
Kno@@ wn as &quot; the But@@ cher &quot; for his brut@@ ality during Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge rule , the comm@@ ander remains popular in this remote former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge stron@@ gh@@ old in nor@@ th@@ western Cambo@@ dia , where he built hospitals , bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of the organization &apos;s former soldiers still live .
But this year , 12 years after the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge sur@@ rendered to the government , long-@@ held loy@@ alties are finally being challeng@@ ed in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
In April , a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime .
In June , the government distributed a high school text@@ book here that for the first time te@@ aches the history of the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge to the children of its former soldiers .
And in July , a joint U.@@ N@@ . and Cambo@@ dian tri@@ bunal handed down its first conviction of a former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge member , sent@@ encing the one@@ time chief of the not@@ orious Tu@@ ol S@@ len@@ g torture center , Ka@@ ing K@@ he@@ k I@@ e@@ v , better known as Du@@ ch , to 35 years in prison .
With each of those developments , anxi@@ ety has grown among An@@ long Ven@@ g &apos;s Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge veter@@ ans , complic@@ ating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to re@@ integrate into Cambo@@ dian society .
&quot; There is res@@ ent@@ ment and fear among the former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge , but they are power@@ less to do anything , &quot; said Ch@@ hang You@@ k , head of the Docum@@ entation Center of Cambo@@ dia , an independent organization that resear@@ ches the regime .
&quot; For them , life under the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge was gl@@ orious , but the regime has become symbolic of evil . &quot;
&quot; It is creating divisions within families . &quot;
During the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge rule of Cambo@@ dia , from 1975 until 1979 , an estimated 1.@@ 7 million people were executed or died from star@@ vation , disease or over@@ work .
When the Vietnam@@ ese inv@@ aded and top@@ pled the Po@@ l Pot@@ -@@ led government in 1979 , rem@@ n@@ ants of the regime and its military fl@@ ed to Cambo@@ dia &apos;s border with Thailand .
There they launched an insur@@ gency that endu@@ red until the last of the movement sur@@ rendered in December 1998 .
As Po@@ l Po@@ t , Nu@@ on Che@@ a and I@@ eng S@@ ary directed the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ lla war from their bases in western Cambo@@ dia &apos;s mountains and jung@@ les , T@@ a Mo@@ k cultiv@@ ated a following in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
But in the mid-@@ 1990s , after a U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ spon@@ sored peace agreement led to the country &apos;s first democratic elections in 1993 , large groups of Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge figh@@ ters began def@@ ec@@ ting to the government , cul@@ min@@ ating in the sur@@ ren@@ ders of I@@ eng S@@ ary in 1996 and Nu@@ on Che@@ a and K@@ hi@@ eu S@@ amp@@ han in 1998 .
Po@@ l Po@@ t died of natural causes in 1998 , and T@@ a Mo@@ k , who had held out , was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dan@@ gre@@ k Mountains .
He died in a Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h prison in 2006 while awaiting trial .
With their bene@@ factors no longer providing for them , most former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge figh@@ ters have desc@@ ended into the gr@@ in@@ ding poverty common in rural Cambo@@ dia , and many remain no@@ stal@@ gic for the movement .
Although a few elite Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge officials kept their local government posts in exchange for laying down their arms , the rank and file remain poor , un@@ skilled farmers .
&quot; These people have benef@@ ited very little following the sur@@ render , &quot; said So@@ k Le@@ ang of the Center for Justice and Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation , which holds public forums throughout Cambo@@ dia , including in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
&quot; They are embedded with the ut@@ op@@ ian ag@@ r@@ arian ideology of the regime . &quot;
&quot; They were brought up with no concept of doing business . &quot;
S@@ or L@@ im , 55 , who joined the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge as a teen@@ ager in 1974 , fought in the jung@@ le around An@@ long Ven@@ g before sett@@ ling down to life as a poor rice far@@ mer in 1998 .
&quot; Life under the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge was good , &quot; he said .
&quot; T@@ a Mo@@ k fed everyone . &quot;
&quot; But now , life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves . &quot;
The ongoing Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge tri@@ bunal has also provo@@ ked wor@@ ries here .
Early next year , the court is expected to begin trying Nu@@ on Che@@ a , K@@ hi@@ eu S@@ amp@@ han , I@@ eng S@@ ary and his wife , I@@ eng Th@@ i@@ ri@@ th , another former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge minister .
The court &apos;s mandate is to prosec@@ ute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes , but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four .
This has done little to calm fears in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
Rec@@ ent media speculation has c@@ entered on Im Cha@@ em , 64 , who was a district chief in Ban@@ te@@ ay Mean@@ ch@@ ey province during Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge rule in the late 1970s .
In 2007 , she told researchers from the Docum@@ entation Center of Cambo@@ dia that she had superv@@ ised construction of the Tra@@ pe@@ ang Th@@ ma dam , a project in which thousands of forced labor@@ ers are thought to have died .
On a s@@ wel@@ tering recent evening , Im Cha@@ em returned from working in the fields to her wooden sti@@ lt house on a di@@ rt road outside An@@ long Ven@@ g .
As the sun cast long sha@@ dows across the par@@ ched grass , Im Cha@@ em dec@@ lined to discuss her past in the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge .
If the court sum@@ mon@@ ed her , she said , she would refuse to go .
&quot; Cambo@@ dia is at peace and stable , &quot; she said .
&quot; If there are more prosec@@ utions , there will be war . &quot;
Prime Minister H@@ un S@@ en , who def@@ ected from the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge in 1978 , has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court pursu@@ es more sus@@ pects , although experts and hist@@ ori@@ ans dispute that .
&quot; Cambo@@ dia must dig a hole and bury the past , &quot; he has said .
But confron@@ ting the past is just what Cambo@@ dia must do to move forward , said Ch@@ hang You@@ k , of the documentation center .
&quot; Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation in Kh@@ mer terms is re@@ connecting the broken pieces , &quot; he said .
&quot; It &apos;s our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand . &quot;
The center produced the first govern@@ ment-@@ approved text@@ book about the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge , the 7@@ 5-@@ page &quot; A History of Democratic Kamp@@ u@@ che@@ a . &quot;
It distributed it in An@@ long Ven@@ g in June as a supplement to the Education Ministry &apos;s high school history text@@ book , which contains fewer than four pages about the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge .
As in much of Cambo@@ dia , An@@ long Ven@@ g &apos;s young people know few details about the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge , despite the town &apos;s connection to the regime .
Touch Val@@ e@@ ak , 19 , a student at An@@ long Ven@@ g High School , said the new text@@ book was helping students understand an important part of their history .
But his parents re@@ acted with skep@@ ticism when he took the book home to study .
&quot; My family re@@ jects many parts of the text@@ book and the tri@@ bunal , &quot; he said .
&quot; They are suspi@@ cious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosec@@ ute . &quot;
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult , So@@ k Le@@ ang said .
But the public forums , the text@@ book and the tri@@ bunal are beginning to have an impact , he said .
Still , the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge re@@ tains a powerful all@@ ure here .
Up in the Dan@@ gre@@ k Mountains , a path over@@ grown with we@@ eds and stre@@ wn with dis@@ car@@ ded plastic bags leads to a rec@@ tan@@ gle of black so@@ ot covered by a ru@@ sted tin roof .
Po@@ l Po@@ t &apos;s body was bur@@ ned here on a pi@@ le of ti@@ res after his death in 1998 .
Nu@@ om So@@ the@@ a , 31 , a road@@ side cell@@ phone vend@@ or , said she didn &apos;t know much about the man who was cre@@ m@@ ated there .
&quot; But he has a strong spirit , and many local people go there to pra@@ y to him , &quot; she said .
It was Nu@@ om So@@ the@@ a &apos;s birthday , and later that day she planned to walk to Po@@ l Po@@ t &apos;s final re@@ sting place , where she would leave a b@@ unch of ri@@ pe ban@@ anas in hopes of bringing good luck .
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium
In a surprise victory for President Obama &apos;s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide , the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stock of highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium , a critical component of nuclear weapons .
The deal was dis@@ closed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Ro@@ d@@ ham Clinton met with Belar@@ us@@ an Foreign Minister Ser@@ ge@@ i Mar@@ ty@@ no@@ v on the sid@@ el@@ ines of a security summit here .
The U.S. government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium and seemed to have hit a road@@ block last spring .
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 18@@ 7 po@@ unds of weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium from a Belar@@ us@@ an research facility .
That set the stage for Wednesday &apos;s agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 po@@ unds &apos; worth , according to one official , who spoke on the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity because of the sensitivity of the matter .
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of Obama &apos;s 4@@ 7-@@ nation Nuclear Security Summit in April , which excluded Belarus .
And it was apparently good enough to secure the former Soviet re@@ public &apos;s invitation to the follow-up summit , in 2012 .
&quot; I was really fascin@@ ated by the fact they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit . &quot;
&quot; That proves to me this process is working , &quot; said K@@ en Lu@@ on@@ go , president of the Partnership for Global Security , a group promoting nuclear security .
Clinton called the agreement &quot; a very significant , important step &quot; by Belarus .
Obama ple@@ dged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years .
Since then , the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium .
Belarus would be the sevent@@ h .
A do@@ zen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration .
At the time of Obama &apos;s Nuclear Security Summit , Belar@@ us@@ an President Alexander Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko had declared that the nation would never give up its ur@@ anium .
&quot; We have kept highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium - hundreds of ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of what is basically weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade and lower@@ -@@ enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium , &quot; Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko said then .
&quot; This is our commodity ... We are not going to make dirty bom@@ bs , and we are not going to sell it to anybody . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re using it for research purposes , is all . &quot;
Belarus appro@@ ached the United States a few months ago , however , indicating interest in reaching an agreement .
The first undertaking to remove Belarus &apos;s ur@@ anium , in October , was especially complicated because the material had been slightly ir@@ radi@@ ated , officials said .
It was loaded onto a special train that travel@@ ed more than 1,@@ 300 miles to a Russian facility for storage and disposal , officials said .
The second operation concluded Monday and was done by plane , according to the officials .
The U.S. government spent $ 13 million on the efforts , much of it to supply Belarus &apos;s research facility with low-@@ enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium , which is not suitable for nuclear weapons .
&quot; This was very carefully coordinated and orchest@@ rated to build up the trust &quot; that led to the agreement signed by Clinton , said Andrew Bi@@ en@@ i@@ aw@@ ski , an Energy Department official working on Global Th@@ re@@ at Re@@ duction .
The James Martin Center for Non@@ proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 88 po@@ unds of weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium , as well as hundreds of po@@ unds of highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium .
Belarus will aim to eliminate its stock@@ pi@@ le by 2012 , according to the joint statement .
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been stra@@ ined for years , primarily because of Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko &apos;s harsh repression of human rights .
But Wednesday &apos;s statement suggested a potential th@@ a@@ wing .
&quot; Wel@@ coming progress on these global security issues , the United States and Belarus acknowledged that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations , and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens , &quot; it said .
The Spanish Government did not raise objections regarding the flights of CIA
The Spanish Government did not raise objections regarding the flights of CIA with Taliban prisoners and of Al Q@@ ae@@ da that were going to Guantánamo via Spanish territory , according to the the USA amb@@ assador in Madrid &apos;s tele@@ gram .
Thus is reflected through the fil@@ tered documents ( c@@ ables ) by Wiki@@ le@@ aks to the newspaper El Pa@@ í@@ s , where it is added that the first vic@@ e-@@ president of the Government at that time , Maria Ter@@ esa Fern@@ an@@ dez of the Veg@@ a , asked that the Spanish Executive was informed in order &quot; to be able to demonstrate that they had carried out appropriate monitoring procedures on the foreign aircraft that cross Spain . &quot;
In June 2006 , after a report of the European Council where there were accus@@ ations of complic@@ ity in practices against human rights in a do@@ zen countries , among which is Spain , a meeting took place between the ex@@ - North American amb@@ assador E@@ du@@ ardo A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re and Fern@@ an@@ dez de la Veg@@ a .
The vic@@ e-@@ president recognized that the council &apos;s report &quot; had taken the Government of Zap@@ ater@@ o outside the game &quot; and insi@@ sted that Spain did not have anything to hide regarding this matter .
&quot; De la Veg@@ a emphasi@@ zed that Spain does not raise objec@@ tion for the intelligence flights over Spanish territory . &quot;
&quot; They simply want to be informed &quot; in order to avoid being &quot; caught by surprise , &quot; A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re relates in a tele@@ gram .
Also the ex-@@ Minister of External Affairs , Miguel An@@ gel Mor@@ at@@ inos , indicated to the amb@@ assador that the Spanish Executive &quot; wanted to give this issue as little attention as possible , although being in the hands of the judges , the Government had a limited influence . &quot;
On the other hand , in January 2007 , the public prosec@@ utor Vic@@ ente Gonzá@@ lez transmitted to the Emb@@ assy that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge of requesting the dec@@ las@@ si@@ fication of documents of the National Center of Intel@@ ligence ( CN@@ I ) and of the mini@@ stry of Def@@ ense regarding the flights of the company &quot;
This information does not contain any inc@@ ri@@ min@@ atory element nor any sensitive information , &quot; explained the Emb@@ assy after speaking with the public prosec@@ utor .
Nevertheless , the USA reflected on its pre@@ occupation for &quot; the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , &quot; more than the dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied information of the CN@@ I or the mini@@ stry of Def@@ ense .
&quot; This coordination between independent investig@@ ators will complic@@ ate our efforts to handle discre@@ et@@ ly the case between Govern@@ ments &quot; ; says A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re .
In March 2007 during a lunch between the amb@@ assador of the USA and minister of the Internal Affairs , Al@@ fre@@ do Per@@ ez Rub@@ al@@ cab@@ a , this one comm@@ ented to him that &quot; although the Spanish judges are ra@@ bi@@ dly je@@ alous of their independence and will do what they consider to be right , &quot; he had given instructions to his collabor@@ ators &quot; to avoid comm@@ ent@@ aries of infl@@ amed rhetoric , in an attempt to reduce the temperature . &quot;
The amb@@ assador also expresses his pre@@ occupation for the action of the PP in this matter .
&quot; In spite of his pro American general orientation , our experience suggests that the PP won &apos;t doubt in capitali@@ zing any indication that the Government of Zap@@ ater@@ o toler@@ ated or deliberately ignored actions of the USA that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights , even if these re@@ vel@@ ations have negative consequences for the Government of the USA , &quot; indicates .
The par@@ ri@@ cide compla@@ ined of the the &quot; burden &quot; of being a mother
The young lady spoke of the baby when he was already dead and she kept a blog : &quot; Terror of the Gali@@ cian &quot;
M@@ ó@@ n@@ ica Ju@@ an@@ at@@ ey Fern@@ an@@ dez is &quot; Mu@@ ki &quot; in the network .
With this nick@@ name , that she has used since since she was young , she communic@@ ated with a cou@@ sin , and at least one friend , both of them from No@@ ia , the town of Cor@@ ua where she was born .
The messages are from 2008 .
In order to understand them , it is necessary to know the personal life that AB@@ C re@@ construc@@ ts through her relatives &apos; testim@@ oni@@ als .
The young lady from Gali@@ cia , 30 years , initiated a relation in 1998 with I@@ v@@ án T@@ ú@@ ñ@@ ez , an industri@@ alist .
This affair la@@ sted one year .
They decided to split , soon after they found out that she was pregn@@ ant .
He wanted to know if the baby was his , but his ex never allowed him to take the DNA test .
So@@ on after that she found someone else .
The man she chose was was Alber@@ to , a man from Lou@@ same , a neighbor@@ ing municipality .
She remained with him for a long period of time .
Ca@@ es@@ ar lived with them .
When the girl went to the Bal@@ e@@ ari@@ c Islands to test the labour market , the child remained with her au pair that accompanied her for one week in Palma .
But in the content of her messages , one can see that their roman@@ ce had ended , it was broken up .
In March 2008 in Men@@ orca , single , she writes : &quot; Alber@@ to is very wei@@ rd and up@@ set , because I have come here to work . &quot;
&quot; When I told him this he seemed to be happy , sure , but now he reali@@ zes how hard it is to stay with the child all day long and not to have the freedom of doing what he wants &quot; ;
Then , she speaks of a message received on her mobile phone that reads : &quot; I want you to come this month or give me an address to which I can send you the child . &quot;
She adds : &quot; If he doesn &apos;t like leaving the child with my mother , I will take him when I get back . &quot;
In May , she speaks about her return to town : &quot; I will go there this week , but I will only stay until the 19th , because on the 20th I must present myself at work . &quot;
She clari@@ fies that if everything goes well , she will keep her first-@@ born child .
&quot; From now on he will stay with whom he must stay , meaning with me and I will never in my life leave him again with somebody else except for my mother &quot; doub@@ tful intention given her bad relationships .
In July , there is another post .
When she writes it , it is assumed that the boy , who arrived at the island on the 1st of that month , and supposedly was assass@@ inated on 10th , is already dead .
&quot; Ca@@ es@@ ar is in cont@@ ented on the one hand , but not on the other hand . &quot;
On the one hand he is with me and he likes the location , but on the other hand he is going to classes almost every day . &quot;
She speaks of a transfer to Mallorca .
&quot; He will go to summer classes there , and thus I can save some money . &quot;
On the 17th , there are memories and complaints .
&quot; Hu@@ gs from Ca@@ es@@ ar , who asked me when you &apos;@@ l come back . &quot;
&quot; Alber@@ to says that he sent I do not know what videos to the email and as you can see when he wants he can find me . &quot;
On the 30@@ th , another one : &quot; The boy is well ; he goes to summer classes to learn Catal@@ an . &quot;
About Vic@@ tor , there is one : &quot; He gives me money . &quot;
On the Internet there are messages of her in blo@@ gs dedicated to animation .
She even had one of her own in My@@ Space universe , where she called herself &quot; Mu@@ ki the ex prison@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Terror of the Gali@@ cian woman ( ins@@ cription ) . &quot;
The last man , who lived with her , decla@@ res his grie@@ f for feeling guilty .
He does not want to think that everything has happened for not having told him that she was a single mother .
M@@ ó@@ n@@ ica entered yesterday in the provin@@ cial prison of Palm , coming from the center of judicial prisoners of Men@@ orca .
Carlos M@@ ace@@ da , the appointed lawyer , explained that he does not remember how the facts occurred , &quot; nor that he had the intention to cause any minor pain . &quot;
Before , yes she conf@@ essed that she had dro@@ wn@@ ed Ca@@ es@@ ar in the bath@@ tub and deposi@@ ted his cor@@ pse in a su@@ it@@ case .
The defence and the public prosec@@ utor asked for a psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c test .
The popular would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PS@@ C would lose 9
With the results of the 28@@ -@@ N , the PP could be decisive in the municip@@ alities of L@@ éri@@ da , Tar@@ rag@@ ona and Barcelona
After the important increase in the votes and experienced de@@ pu@@ ties in the recent autonom@@ ic elections , the Catal@@ an PP is already thinking to the general elections , is there and advance or not ? , the outlook is more than positive , since the number of votes that this formation ob@@ tains in those elections usually doub@@ les the ones received during the Catal@@ an elections .
Thus , the popular Catal@@ ans obtained 6@@ 10.@@ 4@@ 73 votes in the general elections of 2008 , whereas in the autonom@@ ic ones of 2006 , the number dropped to to 3@@ 16.@@ 2@@ 22 .
Last Sunday , the P@@ PC obtained 38@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 91 votes .
If this up@@ wards tendency ensures a transfer of votes PS@@ C votes and the loyalty of the elec@@ torate of the PP . An@@ alyst@@ s of this formation have calculated that , if general elections took place , the P@@ PC could get from 8 to 12 de@@ pu@@ ties in the Congress , whereas CI@@ U would also gain four ( now it has 10 ) and the PS@@ C would lose nothing less than 9 de@@ pu@@ ties ( it has 25 ) .
These calculations would observe that the Catal@@ an area is fundamental for PP and PS@@ O@@ E .
According to the opinion p@@ olls , ER@@ C would lose a dep@@ uty - it currently has thre@@ e- whereas IC@@ V would remain with a dep@@ uty or would gain one .
But , if the electoral calendar remains established , the immediate appointment will take place in May of 2011 with the municipal elections , where the popular seats can also be decisive in the aim of the socialist he@@ gemon@@ y in the four capit@@ als of the province and their change to the front of the Delegation of Barcelona , one of the administrations that hand@@ les the biggest budget - 6@@ 61 million Euros for 20@@ 11@@ - .
Nation@@ alists &apos; as much as popular ones coinci@@ de in the possibility that the PS@@ C loses the city coun@@ cils of Barcelona , Tar@@ rag@@ ona , L@@ éri@@ da and Ger@@ ona , where the Socialists would not obtain the majority nor the possibility of appealing to their traditional partners , ER@@ C and IC@@ V .
Given the republi@@ can fi@@ as@@ co , it would not be a surprise for this formation to lose its representation in the Town hall of Barcelona - it is needed to obtain 5 % of the votes .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capit@@ als and could be a decisive force in Barcelona , L@@ éri@@ da and Tar@@ rag@@ ona .
The nation@@ alists are convinced of being able to carry out the up@@ set in the capital of Tar@@ rag@@ ona , where they governed with the PP before the present socialist may@@ or , Jose@@ p Feli@@ x B@@ alle@@ ster@@ os .
In L@@ éri@@ da , the PP has been placed only to 500 votes of the PS@@ C , whose may@@ or , Á@@ n@@ gel R@@ os , maintains very good relations with Mari@@ ano Ra@@ joy - during this last campaign , they met in several occasions .
The popular ones have also grown in other important municip@@ alities like Bad@@ al@@ ona , Castell@@ def@@ els or Re@@ us .
At the moment , the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catal@@ onia and aspi@@ res to form lists in the maximum number of populations .
The Catal@@ an group facilit@@ ated thousands of pas@@ sports to Al Q@@ ai@@ da
Besides the seven prisoners in Barcelona , in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakist@@ an@@ is and the Nig@@ eri@@ an one stopped by agents of the General Barcelona police intelligence formed a ji@@ ha@@ di@@ st group that , directed from Thailand , facilit@@ ated pas@@ sports to different groups of Al Q@@ ai@@ da , among them &quot; The T@@ ig@@ ers for the Liber@@ ation of Tam@@ il@@ m Territ@@ ory &quot; ( LT@@ TE ) and &quot; Las@@ k@@ ar and Tai@@ ba &quot; ( Let ) , author this last one of the attacks of Bom@@ bay that caused the death of 10@@ 6 people in 2008 .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has paid attention to these investigations , until the point of ass@@ uring that with &quot; Kamp@@ ai &quot; operation ; it has been &quot; weaken &quot; the appar@@ atus of fal@@ si@@ fication of Al Q@@ ai@@ da at an international level and , &quot; therefore , its operative capacity . &quot;
The investig@@ ators calcul@@ ate that the cell , during the two years that has been active in Catal@@ onia , has been able to send thousands of pas@@ sports to Thailand , where they were fal@@ si@@ fied and soon distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galax@@ y Al Q@@ ai@@ da so that its &quot; comb@@ at@@ ants &quot; can cross the European borders and the ones of other western countries with total imp@@ unity .
The disman@@ tled cell is not the only one that the ji@@ ha@@ di@@ st network had in Europe , for this reason in the investigations there have participated , besides the Thailand services , other European police units , reason why it does not disc@@ ard that in territory of the EU occur similar events to the one developed the night of Tuesday in Barcelona .
In coordination with this operation ( The Pakist@@ ani Jun@@ aid Hu@@ may@@ un , A@@ tiqu@@ r Reh@@ man , J@@ ab@@ ran As@@ gh@@ ar , M@@ ali@@ k I@@ f@@ tik@@ h@@ ar Ah@@ mad , Moh@@ am@@ mad S@@ addi@@ que Kh@@ an Beg@@ um , Tan@@ ve@@ er Ar@@ s@@ had and the Nig@@ eri@@ an Bab@@ at@@ unde A@@ gun@@ bi@@ ade were all stopped ) , in Thailand another one had developed with the capture of the Pakist@@ an@@ is Mu@@ ham@@ mad Ath@@ ar But@@ t and Ze@@ es@@ han Eh@@ san But@@ t and the Thai Si@@ ri@@ kan@@ la@@ ya Ki@@ j@@ b@@ um@@ rung .
The group se@@ ated in Spain and other European countries was directed from Bang@@ cock
The Catal@@ an network - part of it was struck in 2009 - mainly rob@@ bed pas@@ sports to tourists who fulfilled the requirements marked by the call &quot; World@@ wide Islamic front . &quot;
That is to say , the documents had to be in the name of men among 25 and 45 years , with validity of several years and without printed visas .
In the means of investigation it is emphasi@@ zed that , for the moment , no data has been found related to the persons arrested in Catal@@ onia regarding the attack of Bom@@ bay , although the author of this attack , &quot; Las@@ k@@ ar e Tai@@ ba &quot; , has been one of the receiving groups of the pas@@ sports rob@@ bed in Spain and soon fal@@ si@@ fied in Thailand .
However , it should be mentioned that days before this committed attack , from Catal@@ onia there were sent through an agency of transfer@@ ences about some thousands of dollars that were &quot; invested &quot; in the purchase of mobile phone cards that soon were used by the members of the &quot; comm@@ ando &quot; that ended the life of 10@@ 6 people .
The Po@@ lic@@ emen have captured a lot of documentation .
The PP asks M@@ as to postp@@ one the fiscal concert
The leader of the P@@ PC , Ali@@ cia San@@ che@@ z-@@ Cam@@ ach@@ o , had yesterday was able to personally present her conditions for supporting his investi@@ ture as president of the Catal@@ an Autonom@@ ous Government to Ar@@ tur M@@ as , identical to ones already raised during the campaign and that resume themselves in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and giving up phy@@ lo@@ -@@ sovereignty , as it is the economic concert that the nation@@ alist leader wants to raise in the line of his mandate .
The president of the popular Catal@@ ans went to the Ar@@ tur M@@ as meeting with the security of having obtained 18 de@@ pu@@ ties in last Sunday &apos;s elections , a number more than sufficient to be assumed popular , since the candidate of Ci@@ U needs that at least one of the form@@ ations that will force the opposition to absta@@ in in the investi@@ ture voting .
On the possible agreement with the PP depend the future alli@@ ances that the nation@@ alists want to remain in the Congress when general elections are held , but , at the moment , the convers@@ ations that M@@ as maintains with the rest of the political leaders in Catal@@ an is key .
As regards the president of the PP , for supporting an investi@@ ture &quot; she will have to make all the sovereign and independent speeches , &quot; as well as the economic concert - similar to the one of the Basque Country - that the conver@@ gent leader tries to put under referendum .
Both leaders have their gam@@ ble of using a very infl@@ ated autonom@@ ic administration and eliminating the succ@@ essions and donations tax .
Of the details of the negotiation on the investi@@ ture of which M@@ as will take care , on behalf of the P@@ PC , Jord@@ i Cor@@ net and Dol@@ ors Mont@@ ser@@ rat .
M@@ as has already met Jo@@ aqu@@ im N@@ ad@@ al ( PS@@ C ) - who promised a hard opposition , Jo@@ an Herr@@ era ( IC@@ V ) and today he will do the same with Jo@@ an Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s ( ER@@ C ) , Albert Ri@@ ver@@ a ( Ci@@ ut@@ ad@@ ans ) and Jo@@ an La@@ port@@ a ( Catal@@ an Solidar@@ it@@ at ) .
The ger@@ i@@ atri@@ cian affir@@ ms that the deaths were caused by &quot; lack of means &quot;
The owners of the center of O@@ lot do not disc@@ ard that their atten@@ d@@ ant killed more than 11 elderly people
The people in charge with the ger@@ i@@ atri@@ c hospital La Car@@ it@@ at de O@@ lot ( Ger@@ ona ) offered a press conference yesterday in order to underline the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Jo@@ an Vil@@ a D@@ il@@ m@@ é , the nur@@ se who while there killed at least ele@@ ven elderly people that he had under surveillance .
The director of the residence , Jo@@ an Sal@@ a , appeared accompanied by the centre &apos;s lawyer , lawyer Jo@@ an Canada , and announced that &quot; the intention of La Car@@ it@@ at would to pin the blame on the individual responsible for of the deaths but &quot; leg@@ ality and responsibility forces us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible people . &quot;
And that besides the social loss of pre@@ stige that the organization can encounter for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the wat@@ ch@@ man , the great threat for the Car@@ it@@ at has now takes the shape of of a substantial in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication that is already calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims .
Jo@@ an Vil@@ a D@@ il@@ m@@ é has conf@@ essed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that since then he didn &apos;t stop killing .
The judge already mentioned in the document that ordered the ex@@ hum@@ ation of eight bodies - old patients of the ger@@ i@@ atri@@ c hospit@@ al@@ - whom she suspec@@ ted that in many cases no doctor personally explo@@ red the dead bodies but , taking into account the age and the path@@ ologies of the patients , the procedure was made by phone .
La Car@@ it@@ at , through its director , fully denied this end yesterday and mentioned that &quot; the lack of measures couldn &apos;t have been at any moment the cause of what had happened . &quot;
The lawyer of La Car@@ it@@ at added that &quot; in the cause there is no indication that there has been an imp@@ ru@@ dent action on the part of any other person who is not the guilty one . &quot;
The one b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed as &quot; An@@ gel of De@@ ath &quot; conf@@ essed 11 mur@@ ders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on the 29@@ th of August of 2009 and a month and a half later , killed another grand@@ mother .
In this case an over@@ dose of insu@@ lin brought her the death ; unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of se@@ d@@ ative tab@@ lets .
The director of the Car@@ it@@ at says that it is complicated to control that the personnel of the center have access to medicines .
The over@@ dose of insu@@ lin and the se@@ d@@ ative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nur@@ se , in his eag@@ ern@@ ess to allevi@@ ate the suffering of the patients , used or killing them .
But the tests that are being carried out in the laboratory will have to clarify if Vil@@ a is not lying and tried to assure for his first victims a less cru@@ el death or if , on the contrary , bur@@ ned them internally by giving them ly@@ e as he already conf@@ essed that had done with the three women that he killed between the 12th and the 17th of October .
In La Car@@ it@@ at they do not give credibility to the appearance of the wat@@ ch@@ man , nor to the number of conf@@ essed mur@@ ders , that they do not refu@@ te being superior , and justi@@ fies his attitude in the different versions that Vil@@ a has given in his visits to the court and the non@@ sense of changing his method of killing after having successfully committed , eight mur@@ ders .
This is why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the reach of this event .
The B@@ CE threatens
The investors suddenly re@@ acted yesterday to the threat of T@@ rich@@ et that noticed that &quot; the markets do not have to under@@ estimate our ability to react . &quot;
The differenti@@ als of peripher@@ als have closed by force and the rates of the European banks have raised more than 5 % .
However , we do not have to under@@ estimate the capacity of the B@@ CE in being mist@@ aken and the Euro has just di@@ pped again which is a wor@@ ris@@ ome signal .
What happened yesterday is characteristic of a non liquid market that collap@@ ses and reco@@ vers but motivated by the closing of short and very specul@@ ative positions .
The institutional investors will take time in reg@@ a@@ ining confidence .
A month ago the B@@ CE called us today to reti@@ re liquidity measures and will spend time tomorrow to reti@@ re by fourth time in two years and those that are left .
The Bundes@@ bank demanded to fin@@ alize the plan of purchase of ineffective national debt and to eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit , leaving only limit@@ less access by week .
After the Irish crisis we hoped that they pro@@ long the present measures of liquidity &quot; at least until March &quot; and maintain the quar@@ terly auction with limit@@ less access by the end of the tri@@ me@@ ster in order to guarantee the liquidity at least until June .
We also hope that they continue with their program of vou@@ chers purchase and give signs of intensi@@ fying it .
If they do not fulfil the generated expectations they will transform the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue being blin@@ ded by reti@@ ring liquidity measures , Good Lord !
As happened during the meeting of May when they affir@@ med that they had not con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated the vou@@ chers purchase and collap@@ sed the markets , tomorrow history could repeat itself .
The B@@ CE must be credible and persistent .
In May announced the ba@@ z@@ oo@@ ka on Monday and on Wednesday said that it had already bought too much , bringing about a new collapse of the market .
The auction of b@@ ills organized once a year in Portugal were very poor yesterday .
The Treas@@ ury only distributed 500 million to 5,@@ 28 % , ver@@ sus 750 million to 4.@@ 81 % of the previous auction .
Even so the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in the entire cur@@ ve , reflecting clearly a change in the market feeling after the words of T@@ rich@@ et .
In Ireland , the Al@@ lied and Bank of Ireland deficit figu@@ red had been made public .
The considered numbers are about 10.000 million in the short term and another 15@@ .000 are potenti@@ als . Until February they have to obtain private capital or will be nation@@ alized .
Although Ireland does not have any credibility for not having detected the problem in July with the economic stress test , the numbers are acceptable within the Plan of Aid and help in reducing the level of uncertainty .
However , the next Tuesday , the Government will have to secure the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still doesn &apos;t have sufficient support , reason why Ireland continues being an uncertainty center .
Angela Merkel has moder@@ ated the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension facing the next Summit of Presidents and Government on the 14th of December where it is necessary a political commitment that could demonstrate that we are a union and that goes in the same direction .
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wag@@ ner and the rest the hy@@ m@@ n of joy of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven .
In Spain , the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the set of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Cab@@ inet .
The Re@@ formation of pensions , transparency in independent communities and financial organizations , reduction of the deficit , liberalization , privati@@ zation , measures for re@@ activ@@ ating jobs sound in the ears of the investors as the four seasons of Vi@@ val@@ di .
The double effect of T@@ rich@@ et and Z@@ P explain that the Spanish sto@@ ck-@@ market has raised 4,@@ 5 % , double compared to the rest of European sto@@ ck-@@ markets .
Unlike February , the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and for@@ ceful and we are benef@@ iting from the surprise effect .
Today there is a key auction of a vou@@ cher to three years that will be having the T@@ rich@@ et effect , reason why we hope that it will be solved with increased demand and will help dis@@ si@@ p@@ ating the doubts on our capacity of re@@ financing .
For Spain asking for a Plan of Aid would be a self sacrifice .
They would give us a line of liquidity that we did not need , the Treas@@ ure has more than 4@@ 0.000 million available in liquidity the triple compared to March , to the most expensive types and clo@@ ses the access to the markets in@@ definitely .
However , the strategy must continue being the one of the woman of Ca@@ es@@ ar , &quot; besides being , looking like . &quot;
Come on , we can do it .
The president of E@@ ulen will contest the meeting of Veg@@ a Sici@@ lia requested by his children
The storm does not moderate the Al@@ v@@ are@@ z family conflict , propri@@ et@@ ors of E@@ ulen and El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o .
David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z , founder of the group , will oppose , by considering &quot; n@@ ull and void , &quot; the judicial meeting of En E@@ ne@@ br@@ o of the 16th , required by five of his seven children and when they try to impose their majority and take control of the management organs of the company that own@@ s the V@@ aga Sici@@ lia ware@@ houses .
David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z and his children Jesus David and Maria J@@ ose are taking into consideration the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their li@@ tig@@ ation for the control of part of the group .
The founder of the greatest holding company of enterprise services does not seem willing to give up in his li@@ tig@@ ation in order to be present in the control systems of El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o .
From his council of administration he was taken off by five of his seven children who appointed themselves administr@@ ators in the council of shareholders on 18th of January of this year and whose opposition is written down in the Mer@@ can@@ tile Regi@@ stry .
The judicial meeting of El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o arranged for the 16th , sum@@ mon@@ ed by the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate of Mer@@ can@@ tile Affairs Num@@ ber 2 of Madrid , has caused ha@@ vo@@ c yet again in the Al@@ v@@ are@@ z family .
The appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is , until the conflict is solved , the single legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting &apos;s convention .
The last actions of Juan Carlos , P@@ ab@@ lo , Em@@ ili@@ o , Mar@@ ta and El@@ vi@@ ra Al@@ v@@ are@@ z Me@@ z@@ qui@@ ri@@ z , is described by David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z as a &quot; desper@@ ate appeal by the representatives of his five children who , by means of procedural sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty , clearly inf@@ ring@@ ing the Law and ab@@ using the right , try to confirm and change the meeting of the 18th of January as n@@ ull , &quot; according to his official spo@@ kes@@ men .
This argum@@ entation will be the basis on which to establish that : once the meeting has been held , he will reject considering it &quot; n@@ ull and void . &quot;
The same pro@@ tagon@@ ists , who maintain a discre@@ et silence , have already tried without success to have the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate sum@@ mon a meeting in June .
In El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o , patri@@ mon@@ ial society holder of the W@@ are@@ houses Veg@@ a Sici@@ lia , among others assets , the seven children of David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z control the 100 % of the capital .
The founder of the service group claims , nevertheless , the us@@ u@@ fru@@ ct on 51 % of the capital , according to the familiar protocols .
This subject is the basic aspect that has to be decided by the judge once celebrated the meeting on the demand of opposition , for which the date is no indicated yet .
Red Bul@@ l tri@@ um@@ phs in F@@ 1 with its secret weapon : Siemens .
There is software that can design improvements to the cars in real time .
Since Red Bul@@ l entered the world of Formul@@ a 1 in 2004 , its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success .
Initi@@ ally nobody considered the options of a team that just arrived , in spite of the as@@ c@@ ending tra@@ jec@@ tory of the last seasons , last November , in the final race of the champ@@ ionship all bet on the tri@@ umph of Fern@@ ando Al@@ on@@ so &apos;s Ferrari .
Without losing part of his reputation as champion driver , the German Sebastian Vet@@ tel , nor the power of the Renault motor that drives his car , in the world of Formul@@ a 1 &quot; the secret weapon that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bul@@ l in order to turn it into a winning team has become a legend .
In fact it is powerful simulation software that the German company mark@@ eted in 2007 with aims very far away from the high automobile competition .
Den@@ om@@ inated PL@@ M , this powerful computer science instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories , energy plants , instruments of high precision .
The objective is to re@@ produce , to fai@@ th@@ fully simul@@ ate the product or the process before construc@@ ting it in a real mode , avoiding this way failures and avoid@@ able expenses .
Pl@@ m has facilit@@ ated the development of the cameras of Canon , the air@@ planes of Su@@ k@@ ho@@ i or the most famous utili@@ t@@ arian cars of N@@ iss@@ an .
Sie@@ g@@ fried Russ@@ wur@@ m , person in charge of the Siemens industrial division , explains that the use of this computer science instrument in his F@@ 1 factory has allowed Red Bul@@ l to design and make &quot; in a few hours , almost in time real , &quot; the modifications , changes and improvements that are needed during the races and tests .
Russ@@ wur@@ m explains that the team in 1992 had an average of 10 technici@@ ans who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season .
Red Bul@@ l has 180 professional young people with high qualifications working today who , equipped with powerful computer science equipment , analyse and project all kind of modifications to the cars .
The Siemens manager explained that the software PL@@ M is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bul@@ l cars except for the engine , which is the entirely the responsibility of Renault .
The materials , fuel , aer@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics and elements of security are being modified .
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simul@@ ator to the reality in 24 hours , thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and auto@@ cla@@ ves of high tech .
The only limitation of this spar@@ k of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formul@@ a 1 can spend at the most every season in order to facilitate the competition .
Red Bul@@ l has build a high-tech factory for designing and producing its cars in a loc@@ ality about 50 K@@ M from London .
There are two buildings in which visits are restricted , especially for journalists .
Everything that occurs there is considered &quot; Top Secre@@ t . &quot;
The factory has 5@@ 80 employees , including its two drivers , the champion Vet@@ tel and Mark Web@@ ber .
The Red Bul@@ l her@@ o , without any doubt , is the recent champion Sebastian Vet@@ ell .
Among the immense technological resources that the energe@@ tic drink brand has put to the service of its participation in the circu@@ its , other pro@@ tagon@@ ists hide whose contribution is in@@ estim@@ able and their not@@ ori@@ ety un@@ recognised .
The head of technology at the factory , Steve Nev@@ ey , affir@@ ms that five years ago it was possible to affir@@ m that the advances of I + D in the cars contributed to 50 % to the vic@@ tories and the drivers were responsible for the rest .
Today these percent@@ ages have varied and the technology adds 85 % of the success , while the drivers contribute with 15 % to the added value .
Nev@@ ey recogn@@ izes that neither Vet@@ tel or Web@@ ber will never be replaced by computer science since &quot; they are indispensable gla@@ di@@ ators . &quot;
HP will open in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
He@@ wle@@ tt@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) inau@@ gur@@ ated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner P@@ ont Re@@ yes .
This it will be first of the network of 20 stores having among 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational anticip@@ ates to open in Spain during the next two years .
The company will make compatible this initiative with the 16 areas already present in big centers as PC City , Car@@ re@@ four , Satur@@ n and El Cor@@ te In@@ g@@ les .
The vic@@ e-@@ president of HP Spain , Hel@@ ena Herr@@ ero , gave as example the re@@ mod@@ elled store located in the Barcelon@@ an Gran Via , property of P@@ ont Re@@ yes , with whom she collabor@@ ated for 30 years .
The North American group has prepared a plan to open 200 points of sale in Europe in 2013 , strategy which includes the 20 Spanish establishments .
The first ones to open were in Buch@@ arest ( Rum@@ ania ) and Bel@@ grade ( Serbia ) the last week , being Barcelona .
Herr@@ ero did not want to reveal the following possible open@@ ings , although she recognized that Madrid could be the following dest@@ iny .
Also the director of HP on personal systems assured that the philosophy to open the stores will be always the same , based on a local distribut@@ or with experience and knowledge of the sector .
The North American group provides consultancy services and is in charge with the exclusive furniture design of the stores ( with products that can be touched of interactive form ) , that in Europe will have an identical image .
In addition , HP covers the formation of the personnel of the establishments .
Hel@@ ena Herr@@ ero denied that it was a system of fran@@ chise and emphasi@@ zed that the exclusive network of commerce tries &quot; to improve the service towards the client and the SMEs in the purchase , the attention , post-@@ selling and even packing . &quot;
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pione@@ ering pilot program at a world-@@ wide level that is in charge with solving the possible problems of a computer science equipment of HP still with guarantee .
An online service connects a technical center located in the Maastricht ( Holland ) .
&quot; Thus , in 10 minutes we can resolve problems that sometimes can last up to two days . &quot;
&quot; This system is especially designed for SMEs and users , since the great companies already have contrac@@ ted services of technical atten@@ dance , &quot; mentioned Hel@@ ena Herr@@ ero yesterday .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell bets on &quot; ste@@ aling &quot; one million clients from its ri@@ vals in three years
More optimistic than other managers , the deleg@@ ated advis@@ or of Sab@@ ad@@ ell Bank , J@@ aim@@ e Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank , but dis@@ cards initially a new crisis of liquidity and predic@@ ts the end of the war of li@@ abilities .
In spite of it , he anticip@@ ates a collapse of the mar@@ gins of interests that will try to partly compensate with raised c@@ ommis@@ sions and the price of the credit .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell hopes to catch in three years a million particular clients .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell has found a way of explo@@ iting the next three years and being able to survive in very complicated economic surroundings .
The bank will start up in 2011 a new director plan that will have a validity of three years .
The objective , besides survi@@ ving without nee@@ ding to appeal to the public aid of F@@ RO@@ B , is to gain market quota by getting a million of new particular clients -@@ 7@@ 00@@ .000 if are dis@@ counted those that might leave the bank , pending on assign@@ ment , since until now they spo@@ iled more the SMEs and companies than the retail client .
This year has caught 25@@ 0.000 particular clients and 5@@ 0.000 companies .
Its market quota of individuals is of 3,5 % , whereas in companies sur@@ passes 10 % .
Another base of the plan 20@@ 11-@@ 2013 is the bet on productivity , meaning , of austerity , with reduction of costs as objective , and whose challenges will be exhi@@ bited by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise .
Fe@@ w banks dare during these times to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has changed all of the plans for the global bank .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell , in fact , will close this year its director plan Optim@@ a , hi@@ red four years ago , although initially it was for three , but the market conditions forced him to extend it into one more year .
The clients who give up savings will be his main objective .
During a breakfast organized by the AP@@ IE , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola insi@@ sted that 2011 &quot; is going to be a difficult and tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ental year . &quot;
The executive , in fact , thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain &quot; will be slow . &quot;
In addition , in two or three years there will be &quot; very difficult to create jobs , &quot; something fundamental for the survival of the banking business .
And , although he thinks that the war of the li@@ abilities - that pen@@ ali@@ zes the mar@@ g@@ ins@@ - is being reduced , the price of the risk subsidies that banks are paying for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity are already moving to the cost of the credit to compensate the fall of the mar@@ gins .
The subject of liquidity and financing is fundamental , and is going to be a pressure factor on credit .
&quot; We haven &apos;t closed the f@@ au@@ c@@ et , but the differenti@@ als are more important , &quot; recognized Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
Ban@@ esto already issued orders on Thursday to his network to limit the long term credit and to raise the price of the differenti@@ als - See Cin@@ co@@ D@@ í@@ as from 2@@ 2nd and 27@@ th of November .
Also he recognized that the tendency of the bank now &quot; it is to raise the c@@ ommis@@ sions , &quot; but &quot; within a competitive frame . &quot;
The director plan of Sab@@ ad@@ ell is based on the organic growth , although , as always , the group does not disc@@ ard corpor@@ ative operations .
Not in v@@ ain , assu@@ res that in Spain &quot; major sizes are going to be required . &quot;
&quot; Next year everything will move , &quot; he assured .
He affir@@ ms that capital needs have &quot; risen too much &quot; and it does not disc@@ ard that some Spanish financial organization enters within red numbers .
And he men@@ tions that the F@@ RO@@ B can replace the market in fund@@ raising before new rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ z@@ ations .
After ass@@ uring that Sab@@ ad@@ ell can survive the temporary closing of the markets , he pays attention to which some ban@@ kers already predic@@ ted as a new crisis of liquidity .
He says that there cannot be emit@@ ted , but unlike to what had happened in June , is possible to obtain short term financing through agreements , which sof@@ tens the crisis .
The C@@ EC@@ A dis@@ cards a second big wave of fu@@ sions in the saving banks
The chief of a main direc@@ torate of the C@@ EC@@ A , J@@ ose Antonio O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta , dis@@ car@@ ded yesterday that a big wave of fu@@ sions of savings banks is going to take place and insi@@ sted once again on the speed with which the reconstruction of the sector is being made .
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started , the there were several organizations that assured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be expect the second round .
Nevertheless , the chief of a main direc@@ torate of the Spanish Con@@ federation of Sav@@ ings banks ( C@@ EC@@ A ) , J@@ ose Antonio O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta , dis@@ car@@ ded yesterday that this new big wave of operations is going to take place .
I believe that the greatest part of the fu@@ sions has occurred , the incorpor@@ ation of Ca@@ j@@ as@@ ol to the group of Ban@@ ca Civi@@ ca cannot be called a second round , there are only adjustments .
&quot; The biggest part is completely done ; perhaps instead of 17 we could have 13 or 14 but all the great processes have been done under the surveillance of Bank of Spain , that has collabor@@ ated very many to this matter , &quot; pointed the manager .
In declarations during a breakfast of the Manager Association and Exec@@ u@@ tives of Ara@@ g@@ ón ( AD@@ EA ) , O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken &quot; with the greatest possible speed , and we must be very satisfied of how this happens in the terms that at the time , not now , were marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain , &quot; he emphasi@@ zed .
To go from 45 saving banks with an average of 28@@ .@@ 500 million volume of assets to 17 with 7@@ 5.@@ 500 million is a process that does not have comparison in history , reducing the number of organizations to a 62 % so that they are much bigger to fulfil Basi@@ le@@ a , he under@@ lined .
O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta recognized that there is &quot; a series of opinions rather p@@ essimis@@ tic on the slow@@ ness of the process &quot; that demonstrates &quot; a lack of seri@@ ousness and reason , &quot; because &quot; what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must fulfil the term before the end of year . &quot;
The chief of a main direc@@ torate of C@@ EC@@ A , J@@ ose Antonio O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta , assured yesterday that Spain has the more rigorous financial system of all Europe and &quot; probably &quot; of the whole world , and he attributed to those who call into question the &quot; lack of knowledge . &quot;
The manager showed that , within the present economic con@@ jun@@ c@@ ture , &quot; we can be very relaxed &quot; with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks , a system that has undertaken a &quot; very important &quot; concentration process and that &quot; goes with the greatest possible speed . &quot;
Also he remembered that the Spanish bank came out very well with the stress tests that the B@@ CE made in July .
Zap@@ ater@@ o and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to maintain the Euro , but has established the conditions for all the Union .
The market tensions have brought about a double governmental response .
On the one hand , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez Zap@@ ater@@ o has suggested new measures of adjustment , from fiscal reductions to the SMEs , regulation of private agencies of positioning or sup@@ pression of the 4@@ 26 Euros of aid to unemployed without contributions , to the privati@@ zation of 49 % of A@@ EN@@ A , the management of the airports of Bar@@ aj@@ as and El Pra@@ t and of 30 % of Lot@@ ter@@ ies of the State .
On the other hand , Vice-@@ president E@@ len@@ a Sal@@ g@@ ado , with the support of the ex-@@ president Feli@@ pe Gonzá@@ lez , has added to the critics to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Angela Merkel her responsibility in un@@ t@@ ying the present crisis .
How can those movements be interpreted ?
She continues that the position of Merkel is not an error in her communic@@ ative policy .
On the contrary , it is another bol@@ t tigh@@ tening in the difficult process of re@@ definition of the Euro .
And there Germany has a radi@@ cally new vision on how its future must be like , that contradi@@ cts the one of maintaining the old traditions of its main partners .
Against the European resistance , in Germany there are specul@@ ations on three possible ex@@ its from the crisis .
First , a strong Euro , integrated by itself , Austria and Holland , among others countries , while the south would leave the monetary zone .
Second , the recovery of the German mark , although now seems to be science fiction , with a very favourable current of opinion , near 50 % of the population .
Third , a re@@ design of the Euro , according to the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control , budgetary rig@@ or , fines to the trans@@ gress@@ or countries , possible suspen@@ sions of payments to some of them and extension of the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments .
The German position is clear and comes defining itself over a long time , so there are no exc@@ uses .
Firstly , in 2009 , when as much the IMF as the European Commission stimul@@ ated the deficits , the German Government presented a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from 20@@ 16 .
This was the first signal of diver@@ gence between what Germany thought it had to do ( plans of fiscal stric@@ tness and stability in the public finances ) , and what its European partners were doing , including France .
The second head@@ ache for the Central European country was when Merkel lab@@ ori@@ ously extended the decision of rescu@@ ing Greece .
Then it was the object of fer@@ o@@ cious cri@@ tic , but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece .
Finally , during the last days of October , Merkel emer@@ ges again with a clear position , demanding the reform of treaties of the Union , in order to make possible the rescue of a country and , at the same time forcing , the private mon@@ ey@@ len@@ ders to run with part of the cost .
This position has been interpreted as anti-@@ European , since it has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the Irish crisis and all the rest .
But her proposal , although somewhat swe@@ et@@ ened , has been approved and , in the next months , we would have to attend the process of reform of the Union that makes possible those measures starting with 2013 .
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not warrant crossing .
And it is saying to us all that , although now it has to take measures with which perhaps it does not agree , starting with that date the old functioning of the Euro , will have been finished .
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area , in which the viol@@ ating countries will be severely sanc@@ tioned , can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and , in that case , the private sector also will support part of the cost .
Germany is telling us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of saving and investment , moder@@ ation in consumption , improvements in productivity , competitiveness and positive balances .
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction , with enormous deficits in the balance of payments , as the one faced by Spanish growth during the years of the boom , will not be toler@@ ated .
The offer is clear .
We should better understand it .
It is not about trying to lead back the public deficit to 3 % in 2013 .
What they ask us is much harder .
And the worst thing than we could do in these circumstances is to k@@ id ourselves .
I hope that the present tur@@ bul@@ ences would open the path to a greater tranqu@@ illi@@ ty
and that we take advantage of the time that they have given us , until the spring of 2013 .
It seems that president Zap@@ ater@@ o has understood it the same way and its double mani@@ fest ( the reforms promised after the meeting of the last Saturday with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures ) suggests that , in spite of the critics to Merkel , has laid way to the the@@ sis according to which one should put order in the house .
But the red line that Germany has drawn up there it is , and it does seem that is going be moved .
And , among the possibilities that are con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated , the one of leaving a monetary zone of little serious countries cannot be excluded .
Then , Germany will always tell us that it had warned us .
Sport and fraud law
Tri@@ cks such as those of Al@@ on@@ so and Ram@@ os before the A@@ j@@ ax demonstrate wi@@ tt@@ iness but not the will to get remove of a san@@ ction .
The exp@@ ul@@ sion pre@@ sum@@ ably for@@ ged by two players of Real Madrid ( X@@ ab@@ i Al@@ on@@ so and Ser@@ gio Ram@@ os ) in the game played on the 23@@ rd of November against A@@ j@@ ax in Champ@@ ions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behaviour is or is not un@@ spor@@ ts@@ man@@ like and if , both players should be sanc@@ tioned by U@@ EFA .
As we all know , a few minutes before the end of the game ( that their team had already won ) , both players deliberately wa@@ sted time which made the refer@@ ee show the second yellow card to both of them .
This way , and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group , both players will fulfil the prescri@@ bed san@@ ction during the next game of le@@ ague , against Au@@ x@@ er@@ re , and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase .
Finally , the committee of discipline of the U@@ EFA has sanc@@ tioned with two games the tra@@ iner of the team , J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , and with different economic amounts the imp@@ lied players .
The pro@@ vocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice , but rather frequent in the world of football .
It is so extended that it part of the e@@ thos , of the un@@ written rules , but followed nonetheless by this sport .
Part of the debate ar@@ isen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the Real Madrid organization ( that in its hy@@ m@@ n pre@@ sum@@ es of no@@ bility and honour , and that has fined its players for analo@@ g@@ ous acts ) and by the dramati@@ zation orchest@@ rated , apparently , by M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , who adds one more to his expanded history of hi@@ stri@@ onic and provo@@ king technici@@ an .
Any@@ way , the debate deals with if that type of behaviour not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradi@@ cts the principles of the sport , that is to say , if with these actions fraud is committed ; then , indeed , they are respec@@ tful actions with the sport regulation , but they seem to el@@ ude its sense .
The matter exam@@ ines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit .
One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players , aspect that with these actions wasn &apos;t put into danger , that is to say , there was no violent game .
Another of these advantages to which it is all@@ u@@ ded to with the f@@ are@@ -@@ play is to avoid that the team of the law break@@ er players takes advantage un@@ ju@@ stly of the opposite team , which did not happen either .
However , the parado@@ x@@ ical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally character@@ ize as legal fraud , because the violation of the rules was not made secre@@ tly as to try to avoid the san@@ ction , but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the refer@@ ee .
They wa@@ ited for and accepted the san@@ ction with no complaints .
Another question is what type of advantage the viol@@ ators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out .
Here it seems necessary to state that it isn &apos;t a disadvanta@@ geous situation for ri@@ val nor is an obtained benefit in the same game , because evi@@ dently the result of the action sup@@ poses leaving their own team with less players .
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game , because the club will not be able to count on those players .
The advantage , obviously , consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game .
But it is about a long term advantage , with a certain degree of inde@@ termination , because the team can be eliminated first of change , and in addition with this action the players fulfil a san@@ ction game and go to the second cycle of cards , in which the suspension by card accum@@ ulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle .
So that , by passing rounds , it is not so clear that it is an advantage .
Those actions are really against the sporting spirit , which is part of the strategic decisions that favour taking advantages allowed by the rules .
Regarding this assumption , the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the san@@ ction ( this would have been a clear case of legal fraud ) , but rather chosen when to o@@ bey it .
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment .
Although the border between the wi@@ tt@@ iness and the law fraud is diff@@ use , in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wi@@ tt@@ iness .
The contro@@ vers@@ y seems to arise from two factors : because it was about two auto exp@@ ul@@ sions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them .
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic .
Offen@@ sive of supplies to catch Christmas d@@ inners of groups in B@@ C@@ N
The way the days fall this year , there is a concentration of reservations on the 16th and 17th .
The celebrations of the employees , who want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros .
As nou@@ g@@ at and lo@@ tter@@ y , once with December the group d@@ inners before Christmas return , that continue being an gas@@ p of fresh air for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona , that because of the crisis has ended with an offensive of price fix@@ ing in order to be able to catch the majority share of customers : almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros on d@@ inners or meals , agree the managers and associations in the inter@@ viewed sector .
In order to finish complic@@ ating the accounting , the calendar of this year ( for falling the New Year &apos;s E@@ ve on Friday ) concentrated the requests in the week of the 13th of December , with the result until that date of an av@@ al@@ anche of reserves of d@@ inners for weekend ( 16 and 17 ) and hardly movement for the previous week .
As was happening from 2008 , when the stage of cost-@@ cutting began , there were many companies that have eliminated collective d@@ inners for budgetary reason .
For not ru@@ ining the tradition , many workers maintain it by paying it out of their own po@@ cket .
Whatever con@@ jun@@ c@@ ture , everyone demanded a price war , confirms the president of the Gre@@ mi Re@@ stor@@ ation of Barcelona , Ga@@ iet Far@@ rs .
The representative of the emplo@@ yer &apos;s association , today , does not dare to predi@@ ct whether the@@ e will be celebrations this month . &quot;
&quot; People consider it long before making the reservation . &quot;
&quot; They want to go out but they have in mind the price situation , &quot; he men@@ tions .
The business will go &quot; well for those who give quality for good price and with good atten@@ dance , &quot; he adds , and remin@@ ds that the clients tend to come down one step once with the crisis , so that the strip around the 25 Euros has become a demand for the majority .
In a pol@@ l made in diverse cent@@ ric establishments one can see the collapse of reservations for the night of the 17th .
So@@ ter@@ as group indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday , with the pre@@ tension of spending no more than 30 Euros , to which they have responded by adapting its menus with formul@@ as of 25 and 35 Euros .
In another of the most powerful groups , An@@ di@@ lana , with 16 establishments in the city ( Host@@ al de la R@@ ita , Market , La Fon@@ da and others ) , the pec@@ uli@@ arity of the calendar has involved more anticipated reserves , even since the beginning of November .
&quot; We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices of the year last , with menus for all the tastes from 19.@@ 95 to 30 Euros , &quot; they detail .
In AN Gru@@ p , which involves El Mus@@ sol , At@@ tic , Qu@@ Q@@ u , and up to a total of 23 bars , they remain optimistic after dete@@ cting an increase of the invo@@ ic@@ ing from the second sem@@ ester and some good , although concentrated , perspective of business for Christmas .
S@@ ources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyper@@ active day concerning friend groups that celebrate the holidays .
To their six menus of the group they have added a Christmas one , with 30 Euros or more as star budget and the perception that there is a pre@@ dis@@ position to spend 10 % more than last year in exchange for demanding more details , if necessary .
They also see green bu@@ ds in some companies that invite their employees and the gr@@ ater the volume the better .
On behalf of the F@@ ec@@ as@@ arm emplo@@ yer &apos;s association ( that includes organizations like the Association of Bars , Restaurants and Lei@@ sure of Barcelona ) , its vic@@ e-@@ president , En@@ ric Gom@@ à , believes he is beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel and considers that altogether the reserves are &quot; che@@ er@@ ful , &quot; although the clients &quot; negotiate &quot; as much as possible .
Indeed , the illu@@ sion of celeb@@ rating has not decre@@ ased for wh@@ o@@ ever pays , indicates this one .
The Pakist@@ ani nuclear program generates great rest@@ less@@ ness in the USA
Islam@@ ab@@ ad produces atom@@ ic weapons at &quot; a rate faster than any other country . &quot;
The fil@@ tra@@ tions of Wiki@@ le@@ aks confirm the bonds between the Taliban people and Pakistan .
The content of the correspon@@ dence between the American emb@@ assy in Pakistan and the Department of State of the USA fil@@ tered by the Wiki@@ le@@ aks portal confirms the enormous rest@@ less@@ ness which the Pakist@@ ani nuclear program brings about in Washington .
Besides the en@@ ligh@@ tening and substantial details that are offered on the content of the convers@@ ations and the thoughts of the credited North American diplomatic representatives in Islam@@ ab@@ ad , the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in the matter of atom@@ ic security , instead of increasing , &quot; decre@@ ases , &quot; and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons with &quot; a rhyth@@ m faster than any other country . &quot;
The pec@@ uli@@ arity of the Pakist@@ ani nuclear program - that the arms are not assembled but they remain stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack@@ -- it constitutes one of the main causes for concern in Washington .
Thus is en@@ um@@ er@@ ated by the amb@@ assador in Pakistan , An@@ ne W. Pat@@ ter@@ son , in a report previous to the visit of the ex@@ - advis@@ or of National Security , James Jones : &quot; The proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under Taliban attack , the rum@@ oured disp@@ er@@ sion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atom@@ ic materials transportation . &quot;
The high number of people imp@@ lied in the nuclear ar@@ sen@@ als and the missi@@ les programs is being taken into consideration , not only by the USA , but also by Russia , such as the reason for maintaining its guard .
&quot; Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious belie@@ fs in order to protect the nuclear power plants ; given the poor educ@@ ative and cultural levels , the extrem@@ ist organizations have more opportunities to recru@@ it people to work in the nuclear programs or of missi@@ les , &quot; said the expert Y@@ ur@@ i Car@@ ole , from the Russian Ministry of External Affairs , in a meeting with his Americans hom@@ olog@@ ous .
The newest information on the documentation fil@@ tered by the portal of Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange is the decre@@ asing cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakist@@ ani rate of nuclear weapon production .
An office of the emb@@ assy in May , that describes as &quot; fru@@ str@@ ating &quot; the communication with Pakistan , says that : &quot; The transparency is frequently non@@ exist@@ ent ; the offers of aid remain without an answer or are refused . &quot;
In another message , Peter La@@ voy , civil serv@@ ant of the National Intel@@ ligence for the south of Asia , states that &quot; in spite of the economic catastrop@@ he , Pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhyth@@ m faster than any other country of the world . &quot;
The amb@@ assador Pat@@ ter@@ son also asks Washington , during a visit of the head of the Army , General Ash@@ fa@@ q Ka@@ y@@ ani , to give clear orders to the person in charge that &quot; the Army of Pakistan must end the tac@@ it support to the terrorist groups . &quot;
Hun@@ ting of the head of Wiki@@ le@@ aks
Obama ap@@ points a person in charge of the anti@@ terrorism fight in order to avoid new fil@@ tra@@ tions .
Inter@@ pol em@@ its a red alert with the purpose of following the movements and locating Ass@@ ange where he might is .
All that is related to Wiki@@ le@@ aks and its founder , Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange , forms a complicated lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th in which it is difficult to have certainty on any of the facts .
Yesterday Inter@@ pol emit@@ ted one &quot; red alert &quot; in order &quot; to locate and follow the movements &quot; of Ass@@ ange .
Nevertheless , this isn &apos;t a traditional order of arrest .
In addition , it isn &apos;t new , because it dates from the 20th of November .
And has nothing to do with the last fil@@ tration of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents per@@ taining to the USA but with the accus@@ ations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden .
In addition , the lawyer of the cre@@ ator of Wiki@@ le@@ aks , Mark Steph@@ ens , assu@@ res that &quot; the police knows where and how to get into contact with Mr. Ass@@ ange . &quot;
It was day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Ly@@ ons ( France ) issued the order at the request of Sweden , but did not reveal it until yesterday , after receiving authori@@ zation from the authorities of that country .
Given the facts , the 18@@ 8 countries of Inter@@ pol have indications for identifying or locating to Ass@@ ange &quot; with respect to his provi@@ sional arrest and extra@@ dition . &quot;
Although the Inter@@ pol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert , many of the Member States , as the organization explained , consider the call network notice free way for making an arrest --@@ that has to undertake the national body of police , - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extra@@ dition , as it is the case of Sweden and England , where Ass@@ ange might be .
The movement ir@@ rit@@ ated the lawyers of Ass@@ ange , who published yesterday a letter den@@ oun@@ cing that the founder of Wiki@@ le@@ aks , 39 years old , declared being willing to take part in a video conference in order to answer any questions from the Swedish authorities .
They also recall that Ass@@ ange asked and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the public prosec@@ utor in his case , whom they compare with the myth@@ ical Lav@@ r@@ enti@@ y P@@ av@@ lo@@ vi@@ ch Ber@@ ia , head of security of Stalin .
&quot; This seems to be hunting , not a legal persecution , &quot; den@@ oun@@ ces the letter .
While the world was searching for him - and from Australia his mother def@@ ends the inno@@ c@@ ence of her son@@ -- Ass@@ ange follows in unknown where@@ ab@@ outs , but not in silence .
On Monday gave from an unknown place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype , a conversation in which he requested the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Secretary of State of the USA , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; If it is possible to show that she was responsible for ordering American diplom@@ ats to sp@@ y in the ON@@ U viol@@ ating international treaties that the USA has signed , she should re@@ sign , &quot; he said .
His opinion was insul@@ ted yesterday by the press secre@@ tary of the White House , Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs , who described as &quot; ridicul@@ ous and absurd &quot; the re@@ sign@@ ation request .
&quot; I don &apos;t know why we should pay any attention to the opinion of a man with a web page &quot; declared the CN@@ N .
Obama himself has ordered to a high person in charge with the anti@@ terrorism fight , Rus@@ ell Tra@@ vers , to prevent new document le@@ aks .
The attempt by the spo@@ kes@@ man of President Barack Obama to reduce the attention paid to Ass@@ ange contra@@ sts with opinions that politicians and comm@@ ent@@ ators now proc@@ la@@ im .
Peter King , the con@@ gress@@ man who from January will pre@@ side over the Committee of National Security in the House of Represent@@ atives , has asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wiki@@ le@@ aks in the list of terrorist organizations &quot; in order to take part and his funds and to persec@@ ute anyone who give them any contribution or help . &quot;
Furthermore went Tom Flan@@ agan , an adv@@ iser of the Canadian president Stephen Har@@ per , who had to withdraw his opinion after saying that Ass@@ ange would have to be murdered . &quot;
&quot; Obama should turn him into an objective and use a non man@@ ned aircraft or something . &quot;
Who did not ap@@ ologi@@ ze was Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st minister , ex-@@ govern@@ or of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as and possible candidate to the presidency .
&quot; W@@ ho@@ ever he is in the Government the one who le@@ aked the information is guilty of treas@@ on and anything that is not the execution would be a too much gentle punishment , &quot; declared for Fox .
Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s looks for peace in ER@@ C with win@@ ks to those who have the same opinion as Car@@ od
The republi@@ can leader will allow the party a secret voting regarding his continuity .
Hu@@ gu@@ et proposes a more plu@@ ral executive and the end of the full meeting system .
Jo@@ an Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s seems to have found the pres@@ cription for negotiating for the ump@@ teenth time the internal revol@@ t in the ER@@ C , without a sight for the loss of 11 de@@ pu@@ ties and half of the votes .
The president of the party is conscious that his threat of re@@ sign@@ ation is insufficient for the supporters of the ex@@ - leader Jose@@ p L@@ lu@@ í@@ s C@@ aro@@ d-@@ Ro@@ vi@@ ra , but he also knows that the influence of that sector today is so di@@ l@@ uted as his own ment@@ or and can cause the him wor@@ ries that he had with other ext@@ inc@@ t curr@@ ents .
For this reason , the leader of E@@ squ@@ er@@ ra will try to gain the new critics with win@@ ks that allow him to be protected until the municipal elections .
In order to begin , Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s announced yesterday that more than 200 national advis@@ ors of ER@@ C could pron@@ ounce priv@@ ately on his continuity .
By means of tickets , and not by raised hand .
If the supporters of Car@@ od want to carry certain vote of punishment to the president , they can do it without fear to re@@ tali@@ ation .
In fact , the head of the ranks wants to avoid the division image as much as the one of submission to him .
In several interviews , he affir@@ med that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes , but added , without mentioning the percentage , that w@@ ouldn &apos;t be good either a result &quot; a la Bulgarian . &quot;
The close supporters of Car@@ od demand the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the milit@@ ancy , a gest@@ ure that is not worth when Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s controls the most important organ between con@@ gresses .
But for not having the majority sufficient to force re@@ sign@@ ations , they are going to try to decide with the executive a direction from now until May .
For this , they hope to participate in the elabor@@ ation of the document of strategic re@@ orientation that the direction will put under voting of the national advice on day 18 .
Its intention is to speak for Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s in exchange for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011 , something that the c@@ up@@ ola considers already done .
The ER@@ C leader recognized that &quot; poly@@ ph@@ ony &quot; har@@ ms stability and that its objective is to make , once and for all , the organization able to w@@ ash the dirty ra@@ gs inside .
In this line , is symp@@ tom@@ atic the article that coun@@ s@@ ell@@ or in functions Jose@@ p Hu@@ gu@@ et posted on his blog .
Consi@@ dering the ide@@ ologist Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s , the holder of Innov@@ aci@@ ó considers a fulfilled act that the leader will be authentic@@ ated &quot; in exchange of diverse objectives . &quot;
And he en@@ um@@ er@@ ated five , of which two are emphasi@@ zed .
First , &quot; re@@ com@@ pose &quot; the executive so that it represents at least 90 % of the milit@@ ancy , that is to say , to include new faces that come from the sector compatible with Car@@ od .
The second can be the great ne@@ wn@@ ess .
Hu@@ gu@@ et proposes that ER@@ C elimin@@ ates the assembly as an operation mechanism .
Thus , proposes a reform of the stat@@ utes that allows celeb@@ rating the con@@ gresses through deleg@@ ates chosen by suff@@ rage .
En@@ ding with the assembly model , an exception in the Spanish system of parties has been an ob@@ session of the team of Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s that already batt@@ led in this sense in both last con@@ gresses .
In fact , the conv@@ ul@@ se conc@@ la@@ ve of the 2008 let the mission of direction review of the assembly in a specific congress of reform of stat@@ utes .
This meeting wasn &apos;t held yet , because the internal flood of the last years advised against confron@@ ting the subject .
Now , without critical sectors on the matter , could be a good moment to re@@ take it and try to close it for always .

China maintains the objectives of reducing gases of greenhouse effect
The representative of that country at the CO@@ P@@ 16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts for reducing the carbon track and detailed that he maintains his offer of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 % by 2020 .
China maintains its offer of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by the year 2020 , assured S@@ u We@@ i , China &apos;s representative to the CO@@ P@@ 16 .
In his first public appearance in the 16th U@@ J Conference on Clim@@ atic Chan@@ ges ( CO@@ P@@ 16 ) , S@@ u We@@ i assured that his country has made enormous efforts for reducing the carbon track and re@@ conver@@ ting its industry .
In fact , during the last four years his country has invested 2@@ 45 million dollars in dimin@@ ishing its greenhouse gas emissions .
Nevertheless , he made it clear that China will not modify its objectives , but will continue working jointly with the international community in that matter .
He added that the Chinese strategy regarding the matter of clim@@ atic change is divided into four parts : dialogue ; construction of capacities ; construction of institutions and endor@@ sement to pilot programs .
In all those parts , advances have been made , including the approval , last year , of a new Energy law , with objectives regarding the reduction of gas emissions , he explained .
On the other hand , he emphasi@@ zed that in China , the federal authorities have been working of a coordinated way with and the state and local ones , in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving , use of efficient energy and reduction of emissions .
In addition , there are in being developed or are already concluded diverse multiannual plans , as much financed by the Chinese government , such as by the governments of other countries .
For example , he referred to the Program of Eff@@ ici@@ ent Use of Energy , that was implemented during the last the five years and that received investments from the Organization of the United Nations ( ON@@ U ) , the government and the private initiative .
There is also being developed a provin@@ cial project of clim@@ atic change , another one for the change of inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent centres by econom@@ iz@@ ers and another of mitig@@ ation and adaptation , he detailed .
At the same table , Martin K@@ rol , scientific adv@@ iser of the government of that country in the matter of clim@@ atic change , assured that the China &apos;s efforts have been greater than generally perceived .
For example , he states , the greenhouse gas emission per capita in China is six tons by person , whereas in the United States is of 100 tons ; China is responsible for the 9 percent of the historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions .
Also , it efforts without precedent in the use of the energy , in increasing by 20 percent its energy efficiency over the last five years and anticip@@ ates to do the same towards year 2020 , he added .
Bo@@ unded to the leg@@ ality exp@@ ul@@ sion of Esp@@ ino : Ca@@ es@@ ar N@@ ava
The national leader of the P@@ AN detailed that the ex-@@ bak@@ er leader is within his right to go to the Commission of National Order to protest according to his rights .
The national leader of the P@@ AN , Ca@@ es@@ ar N@@ ava V@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ ez , assured that the exp@@ ul@@ sion of Manuel Esp@@ ino Barri@@ ent@@ os was become attached to the leg@@ ality and that the ex@@ - leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to protest according to his rights .
In a previous interview to the protest of Gab@@ ino Cu@@ é Monte@@ agu@@ do as govern@@ or of the state , he said that anyway the exp@@ ul@@ sion of Esp@@ ino is a decision made in the local area .
&quot; It is about an independent decision by the Commission of the Order of Son@@ ora . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Esp@@ ino has the right to go , where appropriate , via a claim made to the Commission of Order of the National Council , being a decision taken in the scope of an authorized organ , &quot; he wrote .
On the other hand , he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that never was there in the negotiation table an alliance for the presidential candi@@ d@@ acy .
N@@ ava V@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ ez was convinced that the National Action will get forti@@ fied in the internal election of 4th and 5th of December , where will be chosen his successor . &quot;
This ( an alliance in the 2012 ) is a subject that was never discussed at the negotiation table , or at least not thus far , it was an ex@@ position for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective , &quot; he referred to .
The leader under@@ lined that P@@ AN is supported by 71 years of dialogue , the reason why &quot; we are not afraid of the internal competition ; on the contrary &quot; we enjoy it and makes us stronger . &quot;
He said that without any doubt that the council will know how to choose the best leader than the National Action would require for the next three years , for that reason he will give the office &quot; to whom the council choo@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; I have that absolute tranqu@@ illi@@ ty and openness ; to anyone of the five I would be proud to give the office of the president of party . &quot;
He fore@@ told that the rise the party registered during the past elections on the 4th July will be reflected in the next fi@@ ghts , although &quot; it is not the time yet for thinking about 2012 . &quot;
&quot; So far it is about accompanying Govern@@ or Gab@@ ino Cu@@ é in this duty . &quot;
In this framework , it stood out that the three governments of alli@@ ances in O@@ ax@@ aca , Pu@@ eb@@ la and Sin@@ alo@@ a will be the reason for observation in the entire country , for that reason &quot; many hopes , year@@ nings are put in them , and I am sure that Gab@@ ino will be equal to the challenges . &quot;
While being inter@@ ro@@ gated on the critics of the PR@@ I to President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ ón for his speech within the framework of the four years of his government , Ces@@ ar N@@ ava asked the PR@@ I members to reflect on the 6 years terms of the former pre@@ sidents Er@@ ne@@ sto Z@@ edi@@ llo and Carlos Sal@@ inas de Gor@@ tar@@ i .
If the PR@@ I thinks that the governments of Z@@ edi@@ llo and Sal@@ inas were better than those of Fox and Cal@@ der@@ ón ; they should begin defending them ; and leave the clo@@ set , he affir@@ med .
He considered that the holder of the federal Executive can say expressions as the ones he said during his speech in the National Audi@@ ence , because in the country there is no ga@@ g or c@@ ensure .
Promo@@ te Obama in Twitter law in favour of un@@ documented students
If you agree to the approval of the law Dre@@ am Act , calls your sen@@ ators and make them approve this legislation , twi@@ tter@@ ed the American president on the popular social network .
President Barack Obama has joined today the national mobili@@ zation supporting the law Dre@@ am Act , for leg@@ alizing un@@ documented students , with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter .
If you agree to the approval of the law Dre@@ am Act , calls your sen@@ ators and make them approve this legislation , t@@ we@@ eted Obama .
His brief message maintains open a cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ tic link with an am@@ pler document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the sen@@ ators , since the vote of the legislation is im@@ min@@ ent .
If a expected vote is made soon , now is the moment for your voice to be heard , he indicates .
The message was dis@@ closed after the 42 republi@@ can sen@@ ators threatened to block the vote of any legislation , unless it is approved the extension of cuts of taxes of the Bush era and the financing of the government .
Such block@@ ade , announced in a letter signed by the 42 republi@@ can sen@@ ators , could affect the vote on the law Dre@@ am Act and other projects as the ratification of the new treaty ST@@ ART with Russia against the nuclear weapon proliferation .
A@@ sk@@ ed about the republi@@ can block@@ ade of the law Dre@@ am Act and other projects , the presidential spo@@ kes@@ man Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs tru@@ sted that once the fiscal matter has been solved , a schedule for the rest of the projects could be established .
&quot; I think there is plenty of time ... &quot;
&quot; We all agree that the fiscal issue should be resolved before the end of the year ... &quot;
&quot; I believe that we can obtain an agreement in this matter and later we can plan the sequence of the rest , &quot; he said .
The leader of the democratic Sen@@ ate majority , Harry Rei@@ d , announced on Tuesday that they would request a &quot; vote of closing of debate &quot; for the law Dre@@ am Act , the reason why the initiative of leg@@ alizing un@@ documented students could be voted next Thursday in the Sen@@ ate , although next week is more prob@@ able .
The sen@@ at@@ orial version of the Dre@@ am Act or law of the American Dre@@ am would leg@@ alize about 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16 ; they have remained in the country the last five years and entered either higher education institution or the army .
But those in favour require 60 votes for appro@@ ving the initiative , thus requiring the participation of re@@ public@@ ans , when the supporting organizations of the project carry out intense lob@@ b@@ ying to guarantee its approval .
The demo@@ crats , most of which support the Dre@@ am Act , count on 58 seats .
Nevertheless at least one of them , the sen@@ ator Ben N@@ elson from Neb@@ ra@@ ska , has said that he will vote against , and only a republi@@ can has expressed his support to the law , Richard Lu@@ gar from Indi@@ ana .
For this reason , those in favour of the Dre@@ am Act require gathering several re@@ public@@ ans in case other demo@@ crats decide to turn the back to the initiative .
Among the most assisted re@@ public@@ ans are the sen@@ ators of Ma@@ ine , Olymp@@ ia S@@ no@@ we and Sus@@ an Col@@ lins , as well as the sen@@ ator George Lem@@ ie@@ ux , of Florida , who completed the mandate of the sen@@ ator M@@ el Mart@@ ine@@ z .
Other re@@ public@@ ans who supported the Dre@@ am Act in the past are Or@@ r@@ in H@@ at@@ ch , from U@@ ta@@ h , and K@@ ay Ba@@ i@@ ley H@@ ut@@ ch@@ inson , from Texas , but they have declared that they will not turn their back again .
Another republi@@ can who was in favour , John Mc@@ C@@ ain , has not defined his position at this moment .
Although the House of Represent@@ atives has a different version , an@@ alyst@@ s agree that the Dre@@ am Act faces the major obstacles in the Sen@@ ate .
With Liter@@ ature they can put their finger on it
The second round of The pleas@@ ures of language was a walk over which the participants en@@ acted the nar@@ ration
That of sex in language I understand that but ... the finger on it ? What am I expected to do ? , in@@ qui@@ red the writer Lu@@ is@@ a invited Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela invited to open the second round of The pleas@@ ures of the language , event that celeb@@ rates Liter@@ ature in Spanish and which this time used the sub@@ title of her question ( in another way the round table was dedicated to sex in the language , she explained ) .
The finger on it ... &quot; it puts us in a difficult position , &quot; told swe@@ et@@ ly straight out the Argent@@ ine writer to the public , mainly of young people , who met in the International Fair of the Book of Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara ( F@@ IL ) to listen to this round table moder@@ ated by Mar@@ is@@ ol Sh@@ ul@@ tz and participated Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela , Ser@@ gio Ram@@ i@@ rez , May@@ ra Monter@@ o and Lu@@ is Gar@@ cia Monter@@ o all participated .
Lu@@ is@@ a Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela read a text that she dedicated to Gonz@@ al@@ o Cel@@ ori@@ o and that Sh@@ ul@@ tz would define later as a great story , with Lu@@ is@@ a in first person as the pro@@ tagon@@ ist who in search of knowledge known as &quot; it , &quot; goes from doctor to doctor , from whom she does not obtain answers although gets stuck in the same nar@@ rative thread .
She leaves the doctor convinced : &quot; perhaps pati@@ ence is not my for@@ te , maybe it is my s@@ ore . &quot;
In the end , after a fru@@ str@@ ating approach with the trau@@ ma doctor who who clari@@ fies that s@@ ore isn &apos;t a scientific term ; it is the psycho@@ analy@@ st who un@@ ra@@ vels the myst@@ ery : &quot; the s@@ ore is the real open thing ; the symbolic thing is the scar . &quot;
The pro@@ tagon@@ ist si@@ gh@@ ed allevi@@ ated and concluded &quot; on the s@@ ore I only managed to know that the real thing is open and that it does not exist , &quot; but convinced that the pleas@@ ures and the tri@@ cks of the language have to be mixed .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela , the writer , played with both .
The Nicar@@ agu@@ an Ser@@ gio Ram@@ i@@ rez also exhi@@ bited a delightful nar@@ ration that ti@@ tled Pra@@ ise of the in@@ vention , where the finger on the s@@ ore isn &apos;t named but is discovered .
In broad terms of magical re@@ alism , he tells the story of a famous wi@@ tch , who by tou@@ ching clou@@ ds , brought back men who had gone far away or repa@@ ired the virtu@@ es lost by a ma@@ id , nar@@ ration that turned into speaking about America , a great novel which didn &apos;t lack from the very beginning its own chron@@ ic@@ lers who told it and mentioned Bern@@ al Di@@ az del Cas@@ ti@@ llo who critici@@ zes the exc@@ esses of the things told by the con@@ qu@@ ering cap@@ tains .
Cer@@ v@@ antes who invented us all ( the writers ) lau@@ gh@@ ed of the false witn@@ esses who appeared in hist@@ ories presented as real , but otherwise he would have never told the history of America with imagination which lack sh@@ y@@ ness .
Nevertheless , he emphasi@@ zed &quot; cra@@ zy people and li@@ ars are those who best imagine things &quot; and it is where reality and fal@@ seh@@ ood are mixed , where one knows if the nar@@ rated thing belongs to one side or another , where the fic@@ tional Liter@@ ature reaches its apo@@ gee .
In fact it is named &quot; Cer@@ v@@ antes tradition .
&quot; For its philosophy of : we are what &apos;s told of us . &quot;
As for her , the writer May@@ ra Monter@@ o saw and applau@@ ded the variety of interpre@@ tations that the invitation of F@@ IL causes with her round table The finger on the s@@ ore .
The Cub@@ an-@@ Puerto R@@ ican pointed her own towards the great s@@ ore of the social violence that cro@@ sses her country - and divi@@ des Latin America -@@ product of the disputes on traffic and drug sale .
I believe that good Liter@@ ature , good po@@ etry , good songs lock up a tac@@ it commitment that of course is not pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated , indicated , after mentioning that the reality of Liter@@ ature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that sett@@ les down between author and readers , and that is one &quot; chemical reaction &quot; of this last one .
The night was closed by the Spanish po@@ et Lu@@ is Gar@@ cia Monter@@ o whose intervention also put emphasis &quot; that the finger on the s@@ ore of the writer committed to writing . &quot;
He considered that in a world that lives in a hur@@ ry , also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that it has effects in do@@ gmati@@ s@@ ms , for@@ getting &quot; that behind each affir@@ mation there is a small no and behind each neg@@ ation there is small yes . &quot;
&quot; In order to be owners of our thought and reality we must clarify : and clarify often means to put the finger on the s@@ ore and to bo@@ ther those people who are much more comfortable thinking about the car@@ to@@ on , in black and white , in ideas established without a sha@@ de and also bo@@ ther@@ ing to the powers that prefer a black and white world , &quot; he said , inviting to recover the sense of writing .
Rom@@ ano goes towards his first title
Rub@@ én Roman O@@ mar counts with three defe@@ ats in the fin@@ als , having during his career ups and down@@ s , but he knew how to reach in three occasions the decisive series .
With the du@@ el of San@@ tos Lag@@ una and Monter@@ rey in the final , in addition two different styles marked by their technici@@ ans &apos; face , who find each other with a contrast marked by results .
Rub@@ én Roman O@@ mar counts with three defe@@ ats in the fin@@ als , having during his career ups and down@@ s , but he knew how to reach on three occasions the decisive series , although until now he ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t reached the target and this is why this opportunity is very special for him .
The Argent@@ in@@ ean has ended up being con@@ sol@@ ed with the me@@ dal of run@@ n@@ er-@@ up , and remained one step behind the winners and pec@@ uli@@ arly with similar equipment he has played consec@@ utive fin@@ als .
San@@ tos arrived to his first final as tra@@ iner in the Open@@ ing Mat@@ ch of 2002 , when he took the re@@ ins of Mo@@ reli@@ a with which he fell to 4-@@ 2 before Tol@@ u@@ ca ; later , in the C@@ losing Event of 2003 he also arrived at the decisive du@@ el and he lost also it at 3-@@ 1 and indeed before Ra@@ y@@ ados .
Already with San@@ tos Lag@@ una , in the B@@ ic@@ ent@@ enni@@ al Mat@@ ch of 2010 , again before Los Di@@ ab@@ los , Rub@@ én suff@@ ers again a reverse , since his team finished equally places 2-@@ 2 before the s@@ aus@@ age makers after 2@@ 10 minutes of game , but in the turn of penalties put himself in advantage by 3-@@ 1 with two opportunities to seal the title but finally three players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the change 4-@@ 3 .
Rub@@ én already lost two fin@@ als with Di@@ ab@@ los Ro@@ jo@@ s and one with Monter@@ rey , its ri@@ val in turn , therefore he doesn &apos;t want to end@@ ure the same fate , he wants to celebrate a title for the first time , and he affir@@ ms that the most important thing for him is the institution .
I want be a champion , I do not want break any stati@@ stic , this is for a club , for a passion and consequently the title will come to me , but the previous thing is more important , comm@@ ented the hel@@ m@@ sman when being ques@@ tioned about the numbers he has against by playing fin@@ als .
Very effective he has the previous final , from which , he assu@@ res , has learned much , &quot; the only lesson we can learn is that until the refer@@ ee signals the end we cannot celebrate , we prepare ourselves as well as the players because the previous time , with two penalties we were about to leave and I believe that is an lesson to be learned , we cannot celebrate until the game ends . &quot;
Kno@@ wing that this series could be defined in penalty ki@@ cks , something that doesn &apos;t trouble him , because he tru@@ sts his players : &quot; One should never looks for going to penalties , but rather to finish in regular time ; sometimes you don &apos;t have any alternative and it is necessary to be ready ; in the previous match we were prepared , unfortunately dest@@ iny played into our hands ; sometimes by ner@@ ves or anxi@@ ety for having the title in out hands , but we didn &apos;t reach this goal , and this left us something for this final that we hope to win . &quot;
Roman should stop being a technical run@@ n@@ er-@@ up and ta@@ sting for the first time the gl@@ ory that the titles give .
EU changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Applic@@ ants will have to go to the centres of At@@ ten@@ dance for Visa Applic@@ ants before their interview in the Consul@@ ar Section ; the cost will be smaller and so will waiting times .
From the 10th of January of 2011 the procedure of issuing a visa in the Emb@@ assy of the United States and consul@@ ates will be altered .
With the new procedure , the majority of applicants will have to go to the atten@@ dance centres for Visa Applic@@ ants ( AS@@ C , by its English ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ) prior to their interview in the Consul@@ ar Section .
The AS@@ C staff will take the biom@@ etric information of the applicant , which will be reviewed by the Consul@@ ar Section before the interview .
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants , among which :
The total cost of issuing the visa will be smaller ; it will no longer be necessary to make a payment in order to get the appointment , another payment to process the visa request and another one so that the service of correspon@@ dence gives the document .
The applicant will make only one payment which will cover the three services .
The present tariff will remain un@@ changed : the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa , 150 dollars for cases of visas with request ( including visas for temporary workers ) and 3@@ 90 dollars for visas of re@@ tail@@ ers and investors .
People who wish to rene@@ w their visa won &apos;t have to go to an interview with the Consul@@ ar Official , but they will only have to go to the nearest AS@@ C where they will present their documents and will have finger@@ prints taken .
Because the biom@@ etric information will be taken in the AS@@ C , the applicants who require a second date for being inter@@ viewed in the Consul@@ ar Section will attend one less time than previously .
Also , those requesting a visa in the Consul@@ ates of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez , Monter@@ rey and Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do will no longer pay the extra tariff on service of 26 dollars .

N@@ ASA will announce the discovery ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life
The American space agency called the press tomorrow to present a discovery that will cause impact in the search of living beings in the space .
The National Administration for Space and Aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics ( N@@ ASA ) of the United States will present tomorrow , Thursday , an ast@@ ro@@ biological discovery , that could prove the theory that there is ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life .
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13 : 00 PM at N@@ ASA headquarters in Washington by experts in ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ ology ; a science described as the one that studies the origin , evolution , distribution and future of the life in the Uni@@ verse .
When calling the press , N@@ ASA assured that it will present &quot; a discovery that will cause impact in the search of ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life , &quot; which provo@@ ked speculation by experts in other countries .
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures that look like us living in hosti@@ le spaces that are thought of as un@@ inhab@@ itable , and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve their living conditions .
Appar@@ ently it is cent@@ red around a micro@@ be that was found at the bottom of the Mon@@ key Lake in the National Park Yo@@ sem@@ ite , California , where it lives in an environment that was considered too po@@ ison@@ ous for any form of life , since the lake is rich in ar@@ sen@@ ic .
Som@@ ehow , the creature uses ar@@ sen@@ ic as a means of survival and out of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other plan@@ ets that do not have our bene@@ vol@@ ent environment .
According to ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ ologists , if these organisms use ar@@ sen@@ ic in their met@@ aboli@@ sm , it will be demonstrated that &quot; indeed there is another form of life , a second form of life , different from the one we know . &quot;
The space agency will present the full extent of the dis@@ cover@@ ies in the press conference of tomorrow Thursday .
P@@ am@@ ela Con@@ rad , who studies the possibility of life in Mars ; and the bi@@ ologist Ste@@ ven B@@ enn@@ er , one of the scientists who study Titan ( the greater Satur@@ n moon ) , under the perspective that its chem@@ istry is similar to the one of the Earth will both attend the conference .
Gest@@ a PR@@ D , PT , Conver@@ gen@@ cia and Pat@@ ron oppon@@ ent &quot; block &quot;
With reforms to the Organ@@ ic law of Congress , a &quot; two-@@ party system &quot; emer@@ ges , they say .
The 60 Leg@@ islat@@ ure wasn &apos;t settled when a competing block aro@@ se in congress , headed by the de@@ pu@@ ties of the PR@@ D , PT , Conver@@ gen@@ cia and Jesus Manuel Pat@@ ron Mon@@ tal@@ vo , who declared himself as independent , and the four ques@@ tioned one thing : the arrival of the &quot; two-@@ party system &quot; to the Cam@@ era .
Before beginning the session establishing the 60 Leg@@ islat@@ ure , Feli@@ pe Man@@ z@@ an@@ are@@ z Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , from Conver@@ gen@@ cia ; E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Re@@ y@@ no@@ so E@@ spar@@ za , from the PT ; J@@ avier Cor@@ ver@@ a Qu@@ ev@@ edo , from the PR@@ D ; and Pat@@ ron Mon@@ tal@@ vo , were against the reform of the Stat@@ utory law , given that it excluded them .
With this reform , they reiter@@ ated , will begin &apos; the two-@@ party system , &quot; because now there will be two representatives and an equal number of parties , that will control the Congress .
These four de@@ pu@@ ties , along with Gl@@ oria Mar@@ gar@@ ita San@@ tos A@@ guil@@ ar , coordin@@ ator of the PR@@ D , were the only ones to vote against the Directive Table , headed by the P@@ AN suppor@@ ter Salvador L@@ op@@ ez Bri@@ to and Lu@@ is Antonio Car@@ den@@ as Fon@@ sec@@ a , in his character of vic@@ e-@@ president .
Cor@@ ver@@ a Qu@@ ev@@ edo , detailed that these reforms institution@@ ally constitute the political margin@@ ality from the PR@@ I and P@@ AN .
He detailed that in the near future they will speak with the representatives of P@@ AN and PR@@ I to modify the scheme , starting from a political will , and if they do not have it , then they will be dominated once again by both parties and in this way the competing coalition was brought to a close .
How far they have got ( the competing coalition ) , is what I see , because we are excluded , from any decision , they don &apos;t even have the political de@@ ference of considering the opinion of the rest .
Feli@@ pe Man@@ z@@ an@@ are@@ z Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , from Conver@@ gen@@ cia , mentioned that with the PR@@ D , PT and Pat@@ ron , there are coinci@@ den@@ ces and for that reason they are forming a plu@@ ral group .
It is not possible to allow , he continued , that the Congress after having been monopoli@@ stic , now is a &quot; two-@@ party system . &quot;
&quot; It is not the spirit of the reform the law that has an e@@ ternal two-@@ party system in the Congress . &quot;
In order to begin , this group is initi@@ ating with 5 legislat@@ ors , and is talking with other compan@@ ions so that they could be more , added the conver@@ gent .
E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Re@@ y@@ no@@ so E@@ spar@@ za , from the PT , explained that at the moment the Congress became a &quot; pl@@ under &quot; between two , with reference to P@@ AN and PR@@ I . &quot;
Before it was only one party , now it is being divided between two . &quot;
Pat@@ ron Mon@@ tal@@ vo , asked for the personality of the dep@@ uty to be respected and to give him his place at the negotiation tables . &quot;
Not for leaders &apos; agreements , should be left outside 5 and probably we are going be 9 de@@ pu@@ ties , right now the five that we see , separated into different fra@@ ctions , we have decided order to look for a slot in the negotiation table , that is the subject of the reforms reform that they have decided , we are outside and we do not agree to that reform . &quot;
200 $ thousand more for the provider
The City council of Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án pays another check to the ques@@ tioned propri@@ et@@ or of the company of electrical equipment .
One more check of more than 200 thousand p@@ es@@ os in favour of Lor@@ ena Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e Cam@@ ach@@ o Pal@@ a@@ zu@@ el@@ os was issued by the City council .
With this , the amount that has been paid in this second sem@@ ester to the propri@@ et@@ or of the electrical equipment company , as@@ c@@ ends to 1 million 200 thousand p@@ es@@ os .
In agreement with the Municip@@ ality transparency document , this last check number 9@@ 25@@ 8@@ 4@@ 47 was issued on 16th of November , with the amount of 200 thousand 14@@ 4,@@ 56 p@@ es@@ os , under the concept of &quot; liqui@@ dation of accounts to be paid . &quot;
The Treas@@ urer Lu@@ is Miguel L@@ op@@ ez Mor@@ eno had previously said that they were being paid more money by the Municip@@ ality in favour of this supplier , that was observed by the Superior Audi@@ t of the State for selling to a higher price .
What wasn &apos;t reported is the total that still has to be paid and , therefore , how many checks have to be issued to Cam@@ ach@@ o Pal@@ a@@ zu@@ el@@ os .
Nothing has been bought , they simply pay the supplier the owned amounts , as the rest of providers , said in an interview .
The last checks &quot; appeared once again &quot; in the last quar@@ terly of the year : 24 of September , two issued on 15th of October , 19th of October , 29@@ th of October and this last one , on 16th of November .
Although the supplier has@@ n &apos;t been published yet in the Official Newsp@@ aper of the State , as the Law asks when a company is ques@@ tioned by ASE , in order to avoid that other governments use its services , the Treas@@ urer assured that they didn &apos;t use its services anymore .
Before , after the 25@@ th of July , when the Nor@@ o@@ este published a revision of the checks that the City council issues for its suppliers , in which it was revealed that , from March 2008 until 9th of July of 2010 , the tri@@ enni@@ um of the Mayor Jor@@ ge A@@ bel L@@ op@@ ez San@@ che@@ z , the Municip@@ ality paid to Cam@@ ach@@ o Pal@@ a@@ zu@@ el@@ os more than 10 million p@@ es@@ os , through 42 checks .
It also concluded transactions with Ju@@ ma@@ p@@ am , where received checks for more than 3 million p@@ es@@ os .
It is urgent that the tourist sites are taken care of
The tourist industri@@ alists feel sorry for the accident of the foreign tourist caused by bad conditions of the Gl@@ ori@@ eta San@@ che@@ z T@@ abo@@ ada in Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án .
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the down@@ -@@ fall of Gl@@ ori@@ eta San@@ che@@ z T@@ abo@@ ada , the tourist sector of Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án asked the authorities to pay attention to the zones and sites that are in a bad state and that offer a bad image of the port .
Salvador Bar@@ ra@@ za Rub@@ io , president of the Association of Ret@@ ail@@ ers of the Zone Dor@@ ada , remembered that in different occasions they have den@@ ounced that the image of the dest@@ iny should be taken care of and to change the bad perc@@ ep@@ tions that the tourists might find with new activities or routes .
He said that the bad conditions of the streets and the si@@ de-@@ walks have affected because the tourists come to take a walk and see the dis@@ order and they avoid the complementary businesses .
The politicians do not know what it means to close for one day and do not have any idea about the amount of money that is lost , or otherwise they w@@ ouldn &apos;t do the jobs this way in such a long period of time and without previous planning .
The hotel@@ keep@@ er J@@ ose Ram@@ on Man@@ gu@@ art San@@ che@@ z said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the part of the City council .
&quot; The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and to avoid this happening again , by giving preventive maintenance and not doing only the correction , &quot; he said .
We look forward to enjoying a clean city , because not only must the area be given the maintenance , but as inhabitants who deserve a clean site to live on ; the City council must change its strategy in order to maintain good living and visiting conditions .
There are other sites that are also negle@@ cted and incomplete , he said , as for example El Es@@ cu@@ do and the Ven@@ adi@@ to de Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án .
&quot; Nowadays , for the tourist to come does depend only by the promotion , we must have a good product , a city that has clean beaches and aven@@ ues , permanent maintenance of the attraction areas , &quot; he said .
&quot; There wasn &apos;t enough attention paid and this under@@ lines something that is well-known by all , that maintenance is a must . &quot;
Rau@@ l L@@ ler@@ a Mart@@ ine@@ z , secre@@ tary assi@@ stant of Tourist Pro@@ motion , expressed that the rescue of tourist sites of Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án is urgent , because they are not enjoyed of a correct manner and they project a bad image .
He spoke of a series of places that has to ali@@ gn altogether with the municipality and to be a priority having the city always , clean , ordin@@ ate and attractive because it is a tour@@ istic city .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be put in order first of all , cleaned and made attractive in order to be able to add them in the inventory when promoting the city .
IP requests results from the Congress
E@@ du@@ ardo D@@ á@@ val@@ os , president of the C@@ EC , proposed that the de@@ pu@@ ties assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sin@@ alo@@ a by the diverse challenges that faces .
A Leg@@ islat@@ ure of decent works and free from agreements between parties and the Executive state is being demanded by the enterprise sector of Maz@@ at@@ l@@ án , because there is a conv@@ ul@@ sed Sin@@ alo@@ a that faces great problems .
Yesterday the 60 legislat@@ ure was voted in , integrated by seven political forces , 19 de@@ pu@@ ties of the PR@@ I , 13 of the P@@ AN , three of the Party Nu@@ eva Ali@@ an@@ za , two of the PR@@ D , one of the PT , one of the Conver@@ gen@@ cia and one more of the PV@@ EM , meaning a total of 40 popular representatives .
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the S-@@ state it is mentioned that they come to fulfil a clean management of commitment to the society and the different sectors that require a responsible legislative work .
E@@ du@@ ardo D@@ á@@ val@@ os Z@@ am@@ ora , president of the Enterprise Co@@ ordin@@ ating Council , proposed that the just released 40 de@@ pu@@ ties of the Congress of the State assumed the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sin@@ alo@@ a by the diverse challenges that faces .
We hope that the de@@ pu@@ ties will really exert their right , free from agreements between the parties because it is a custom to make agreements in order to guard by their own interests and they become a character in a car@@ ni@@ val of the govern@@ ors and leaders of the parliamentary fra@@ ctions .
For that reason he spoke about certi@@ fying the commitment in order to establish the necessary bridges that could help the Govern@@ or to go ahead .
We hope that they come to do a worthy work and mainly committed to the society and the sectors because the habit@@ ants of Sin@@ alo@@ a were those who gave them the vote of confidence during the last elections .
J@@ ose Ram@@ on Man@@ gu@@ art San@@ che@@ z , president of the Association of Hotels T@@ res Is@@ las , considered that one of the greatest challenges for the 40 popular representatives is the one of pushing and adding forces in search of the economic growth of the state , because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated .
The most important thing is to push economic growth , that generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will form a new generation of jobs .
As for the tourist activity , he demanded that the new legislat@@ ors give the weight revised within the state budget in order to forti@@ fy the Secretary of Tourism .
As I have understood this is the second department of the state with fewer budgets and is in@@ con@@ gru@@ ous an important and economic activity generating currencies and investment and that directly compet@@ es with the ag@@ ro industry .
Apart from requiring labelling resources the de@@ ton@@ ating tourist projects that help giving security to the state and update the Al@@ co@@ hol Law that has not been able to solve in the previous legislat@@ ures .
A ma@@ gi@@ cian is looked for
D@@ olls , cars and bicy@@ cles , among others toys , are the year@@ ning of the children of the family Cor@@ on@@ ado from Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
For his parents , the next Day of K@@ ings will be difficult to please his illu@@ sions , since their home is made out of no more than 12 people and a go@@ at .
Nevertheless , Adel@@ ai@@ da , Isa@@ bel , Jesus , J@@ ose Al@@ fre@@ do , Maria Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e , Isa@@ ias , J@@ ose Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Mel@@ cher , G@@ asp@@ ar and Bal@@ th@@ az@@ ar will give them the toys and clothes they so much wish .
The family lives in a hum@@ ble house of the Col@@ ony Salvador All@@ ende and lives in poor conditions because the father does not have a job .
Sometimes it is very hard for us because my husband does not have a job , but we sell mand@@ arin and d@@ ad@@ dy ... in the afternoon I leave with the kids to sell in the street , &quot; said Ca@@ y@@ et@@ ana Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela An@@ dra@@ de , mother of the children .
Adel@@ ai@@ da , 4 years old , wants a dol@@ l or a bicycle , while her sister Isa@@ bel , 3 years old , would like a Bar@@ bie dol@@ l .
On the other hand , J@@ ose Al@@ fre@@ do , 10 years old , has wished for a very long time to have a &quot; mon@@ ster &quot; car and for his brother Jesus , 8 months old , Ca@@ y@@ et@@ ana suggests clothes suitable for a one year baby .
He told me ( J@@ ose Al@@ fre@@ do ) , I would like this mon@@ ster , &quot; but I said &quot; we will see son &quot; because it was very expensive , &quot; remembered Ca@@ y@@ et@@ ana with s@@ ad@@ ness .
For the el@@ der children that were at school clothes and shoes would be perfect .
Maria Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e , 11 years old , is size 12 ; Isa@@ ias , 10 years old , is size 10 , whereas Miguel , 8 years old , uses size eight .
J@@ ose Juan , 14 years old , needs tennis , reason why a pair of size five and a half or six would helpful to him .
If you want to make this dream come true for the children of the Cor@@ on@@ ado family from Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela you can participate in the campaign as there is a need for a Magi@@ cian , by don@@ ating a to@@ y or cash at the reception of the Nor@@ o@@ este .

&quot; Ap@@ proxim@@ ately 750 cann@@ ab@@ is plants , 4 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ mes of h@@ ash@@ ish , money and equipment which served for production were sei@@ zed &quot; stated K@@ Lou@@ is-@@ Phili@@ ppe Ru@@ el , spo@@ kes@@ man of the Que@@ bec S@@ û@@ ré@@ té .

C@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine migration can be pursued without pro@@ be@@ ms
According to the government , the con@@ servatives &apos; draft law should solve the problem of bo@@ at@@ loads of illegal migrants , but will in all prob@@ ability be defe@@ ated , since the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it .
&quot; I strongly rely on the Charter . &quot;
&quot; I support ther party , which created the gran@@ ite bene@@ ath your feet &quot; declared the liberal chief Michael Ign@@ ati@@ e@@ ff , surrounded by de@@ pu@@ ties after the weekly cau@@ cus meeting .
The liber@@ als claim that the draft law in its present form which would an@@ able any person from a ship identified as carrying c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine immigrants , would viol@@ ate the Canadian charter of rights and liber@@ ties .
The chief of the Que@@ bec Block , Gil@@ les Du@@ cep@@ pe has also said that he could not support the draft law , because its aim is wrong .
&quot; We are opposed and it appears that all the opposition parties are opposed and we will now see what the government does &quot; declared M. Du@@ cep@@ e
The cri@@ tic of N@@ P@@ D concerning immigration , Oli@@ via C@@ how , has rejected the out of hand the criticisms stati@@ gn that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants .
&quot; the neo-@@ demo@@ crats approve the taking of steps against persons handling illegal immigrants and this is what we are doing by means of another draft law , the C-@@ 35 &quot; stated M@@ me C@@ how .
&quot; We do not support the Con@@ servatives &apos; draft law because it attacks refugees and im@@ pris@@ ons their children for at least a year , &quot; explained M@@ me C@@ how .
The Minister of Imm@@ igration . Jas@@ on Ken@@ ney , accused the opposition parties of playing politics and of ignor@@ ing the will of Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Canadi@@ ans are telling de@@ pu@@ ties loud and clear that they will not toler@@ ate this kind of illegal immigration , these criminal operations which target Canada and which treat the country like a door@@ m@@ at . &quot;
&quot; They expect Canada to adopt firm measures &quot; was the reaction of Minister Ken@@ ney .
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on the draft law , which could bring about elections in the event of its rejection .
A Con@@ servative has however told the Q@@ M@@ I Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposed dep@@ uty shall explain his reasons to his elec@@ tors .
The new unity does not create unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Cha@@ rest of the possible creation of a permanent unit for combating corruption and col@@ lu@@ sion , numerous observers continue to demand the creation of a commission of public inquiry into the subject .
The Minister of Public Security , Rob@@ rt Du@@ til , asser@@ ts that this idea is not new : Que@@ bec consulted the New York Department of Investi@@ gation on the subject last January .
The metro@@ polis has had a permanent anti-@@ corruption unit since 18@@ 70 .
Nevertheless , the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one person .
It must be said that at a m@@ meeting of the Que@@ bec permanent police council last 29 October this step was never discussed , not@@ with@@ standing the presence of Robert Du@@ til .
It did not need any more than that the public security cri@@ tic Steph@@ ane Ber@@ ger@@ on should call this announcement a &quot; rab@@ bit produced out of the hat &quot; and as &quot; a solution thrown together on the corner of a table &quot;
Minister Du@@ til rep@@ lied to those f@@ ear@@ ing that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unit .
&quot; You will see the result when it is announced , he cont@@ ented himself with affir@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; One is aware of that problem . &quot;
As far as the president of the CS@@ Q , Ré@@ j@@ ean Par@@ ent is concerned , nothing can replace the launch of a public inquiry .
&quot; The more obst@@ in@@ ately M.@@ Cha@@ rest ref@@ uses to create this commission of inquiry , the more people will think like you and I that there is something to be hidden , &quot; he explains .
&quot; The only way to get a commission of inquiry is for Jean Cha@@ rest to re@@ sign &quot; explains Y@@ ves Bo@@ is@@ ver@@ t , Professor of Eth@@ ics and Government at the E@@ col@@ e Nationale d &apos;@@ Administration Publi@@ que
In order to get out of this im@@ pas@@ se he therefore suggests that Que@@ bec should give a special mandate to the General Ver@@ i@@ fier for the latter to in@@ qu@@ ire into col@@ lu@@ sion and corruption .
&quot; One must be able to bro@@ aden the mandate of the General Ver@@ i@@ fier , &quot; he decides .
He also feels that Que@@ bec could con@@ fer on the Ver@@ i@@ fier the same powers as those of a commission@@ er , allowing the former to comp@@ el people to t@@ esti@@ fy .
The creation of a permanent group of people is not the only project on the Cha@@ rest government programme .
Que@@ bec would also ask Ot@@ ta@@ wa to modify the criminal code , to make it more suitable for this type of crime .
This request would come from the prosec@@ utor of the Mar@@ teau operation , who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-@@ Marc Four@@ nier that precedent is not explicit on this type of inquiry .
The Federal Minister of Public Security , V@@ ic To@@ e@@ ws confirmed that his colleague at Justice , Ro@@ b Nichol@@ son is currently inc@@ lined to introduce certain amendments .
At the time of the Spring 2001 operation , which targeted groups of motor cy@@ cli@@ sts , even though the criminal code had not been adapted , 18@@ 1 persons were arrested ..
Ot@@ ta@@ wa subsequently ruled to adopt the law on gang@@ ster@@ ism
Ri@@ vers under close surveillance
Several water courses continue to be under close surveillance due to the heavy ra@@ ins falling in several regions of the province since Tuesday
A land slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Sha@@ win@@ ig@@ an in Mauri@@ tia .
Two houses were ev@@ acu@@ ated as a precau@@ tion .
In the evening another land slide occurred at Saint-@@ Lin@@ -@@ Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ des in Len@@ audi@@ ère .
A road collap@@ sed .
Between Tuesday and Wednesday evening heavy rain ( from 40 to 70 milli@@ metres ) fell in several regions .
Between 20 and 40 milli@@ metres of additional rain were expected between now and Thursday evening depending on region .
Sec@@ tors north of the river and in Out@@ a@@ ou@@ ais alley were worst affected .
They received a total of up to 100 milli@@ metres of rain .
Since these falls will be added to the th@@ a@@ wing of snow already lying in certain sectors , the over@@ f@@ lowing of several rivers is fe@@ ared .
F@@ lood al@@ er@@ ts were issued on Wednesday evening by Que@@ bec Civil Security for the rivers Ou@@ are@@ au and Ach@@ ig@@ an in Len@@ audi@@ ère .
The rivers Nord in Saint Jer@@ ô@@ me , in the Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ des and Ch@@ è@@ ne in Lot@@ b@@ ini@@ ère were the object of flood war@@ nings and remained under surveillance .
In the Lan@@ audi@@ ère region , heavy ra@@ ins caused the over@@ f@@ lowing of certain lakes at Sa@@ inte@@ -@@ Juli@@ enne , Sa@@ inte@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ ine-@@ de-@@ Kil@@ dare , as well as at Ra@@ w@@ don .
At Sa@@ inte@@ -@@ Cali@@ x@@ te , a provi@@ sional bridge was swe@@ pt away by heavy ra@@ ins .
Ten d@@ well@@ ings had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated as a precau@@ tion .
In the Out@@ a@@ ou@@ ais , the over@@ f@@ lowing of certain lakes ent@@ ailed the closure of several roads , in particular in the municipality of Man@@ s@@ fiel@@ d-@@ et-@@ Pon@@ te@@ fra@@ ct .
An@@ nik Bou@@ ch@@ ard , a security consul@@ tant , stated that Civil Security continued to be in a state of alert and was monitoring the situation closely .
On Wednesday , Que@@ bec F@@ lood Fo@@ rec@@ ast Centre issued flood war@@ nings in respect of several rivers , in particular Mas@@ kin@@ ong@@ é , As@@ som@@ ption , Ou@@ are@@ au , L &apos;@@ Ach@@ ig@@ an , B@@ atis@@ can and Lou@@ p .
Dup@@ ont partly bl@@ amed
The Que@@ bec radio anim@@ ator St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Dup@@ ont suffered a partial reverse before the Canadian Radio and Tele@@ vision Standards Council ( C@@ CN@@ R ) on the subject of social assistance and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , as well as on that of his co@@ ar@@ se language whilst on air .
T@@ ne CN@@ N@@ R feels that M. Dup@@ ont and his team of CH@@ O@@ I 9@@ 8,@@ 1 F@@ M had the right to express their views , but that certain topics contained &quot; in@@ exact information on social assistance , un@@ duly negative statements concerning Ha@@ iti@@ ans and co@@ ar@@ se language not suitable for day@@ time broad@@ casts . &quot;
The Council also concluded that a discussion about suicide including the broadcasting of the names of two persons who had committed suicide , did not infrin@@ ge broadcasting codes .
The C@@ CN@@ R had received several complaints on the subject of comments made during bra@@ d@@ casts between 2008 and 2010 .
The first decision was given following a complaint by the Que@@ bec Common Front of persons receiving social assistance .
The group compla@@ ined that the sums quoted in the broad@@ casts were not accurate .
The anim@@ ators must present solid , not dec@@ ep@@ tive information .
Conc@@ erning suicide , the anim@@ ator Steph@@ ane Dup@@ ont felt that suicide was the action of a co@@ ward .
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the message conve@@ yed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution of life &apos;s problems .
&quot; The majority of the Committee feels that the ep@@ iso@@ des in question of &quot; Dup@@ ont mid@@ day &quot; appro@@ ached a delicate subject in a balanced and appropriate manner . &quot;
Accordingly , no blame attached to him .
The last dispute concerned the declarations which followed the Haiti earthquake .
St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Dup@@ ont and Jean-@@ Ren@@ é Du@@ fort then had a fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face media discussion , which gave rise to a lot of reactions .
The CH@@ O@@ I anim@@ ator declared that he had not made any contribution to help the Ha@@ iti@@ ans , because one could not be certain that the people in need really would receive the money .
The Committee believes that the comments were not impro@@ per , but that their cum@@ ul@@ ative effect concerning Ha@@ iti@@ ans was un@@ duly negative .
&quot; I have already served my three-@@ day suspension there . &quot;
&quot; My record has now been clean for eigh@@ teen months , &quot; declared the anim@@ ator .
In all its decisions the Committee condem@@ ns the broadcasting of co@@ ar@@ se language .
The broad@@ cast@@ er CH@@ O@@ I@@ -F@@ N collabor@@ ated &quot; beyond the call of duty &quot; in all cases .
The consequences are minimal for the station which must , inter al , announce these decisions once during the hours of maximum audience within three days .
The king of k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu in Montreal
The Montreal resident of Alger@@ ian origin , N@@ ac@@ er@@ ed@@ dine Z@@ em@@ mal , has an extremely individual programme .
The athle@@ te , who exc@@ els at &quot; s@@ anda &quot; ( &quot; full contact &quot; k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu ) , at ki@@ ck@@ bo@@ xing and at Thai bo@@ xing , is entering the tat@@ ami and the rings of the world in search of fresh ch@@ all@@ an@@ ges .
&quot; I started practi@@ sing mar@@ tial arts such as k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu and ki@@ ck@@ bo@@ xing 12 years ago in Algeria , &quot; explained Z@@ em@@ mal who has lived in the capital since 2008 in order to train with professionals .
&quot; In my case I look for fi@@ ghts everywhere , since for those who do not like the floor fi@@ ghts present in mixed mar@@ tial arts , competitions in North America are rare . &quot;
Recently , the man working as security agent for the UPS company , had bad news for his ri@@ vals , having gained two gold me@@ d@@ als in the am@@ ateur world champ@@ ionship of the World Kar@@ ate and Ki@@ ck@@ bo@@ xing Association ( W@@ K@@ A ) held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh in Scotland .
&quot; I won in the classes of full contact ki@@ ck@@ bo@@ xing and Thai bo@@ xing , &quot; he explained .
&quot; I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Sh@@ ou World Cup . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ peti@@ tors who finished among the first four zt the prec@@ eding world champ@@ ionship in each class , were invited . &quot;
&quot; In Tor@@ onto in 2009 I won the bron@@ ze me@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; In Vietnam in 2005 , I finished eig@@ th . &quot;
&quot; I finished fifth in the 2007 tournament in China and third in Tor@@ onto in 2009 , &quot; he added .
&quot; What is interesting is that I did better at each competition . &quot;
&quot; At this rate I will be first this year , or next ! &quot;
The &quot; san sh@@ ou &quot; or &quot; s@@ anda &quot; is an original Chinese contest , where pun@@ ches and ki@@ cks , as well as thro@@ wing to the ground is authorised .
The fi@@ ghts take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring .
The most famous pu@@ gi@@ list from this form of combat is the American of Vietnam@@ ese origin , C@@ ung Le , well known in the world of mar@@ tial arts .
If N@@ ac@@ er Z@@ em@@ mal is asked to recall only one event of his career , it will surely be his participation in the &quot; King of S@@ anda &quot; tournament in the k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu Super Bow@@ l .
&quot; This competition is the most often mentioned and the most prestigious in China , &quot; explained the agre@@ eable , stra@@ pping young man .
&quot; It is the equivalent of the L@@ ump@@ ine@@ e Stadium , ( the largest stadium in Thailand ) . &quot;
&quot; It was a super experience . &quot;
Z@@ em@@ mal won his first fight , a semi-@@ final in his class ( 80 kg ) , before losing in the fin@@ als .
&quot; The man who beat me was a real professional &quot; he analy@@ sed .
&quot; There are four figh@@ ters in each class ( 80 kg , 85 kg , 90 kg and 95 kg ) &quot;
&quot; The winners of the semi-@@ fin@@ als fight one another in the fin@@ als of their class . &quot;
&quot; The winners in each class fight one another for the title of a si@@ gle champion , the king of k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu . &quot;
450 mili@@ on &apos; worth of contracts without calls for tender
Hydro@@ -@@ Que@@ bec awarded 450 million dollars &apos; worth of contracts to engineering companies for the E@@ ast@@ main@@ -@@ 1-@@ A@@ -S@@ ar@@ cel@@ le-@@ Ru@@ per@@ t hydro@@ electric project .
At the core of this av@@ al@@ anche of over 100 contracts is a con@@ sortium formed by the companies B@@ PR . Des@@ sau , S@@ N Group and A@@ x@@ or , which secured the most important one , that of managing the project for the sum of 2@@ 95 million dollars without a call for tender .
The con@@ sortium called Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce was formed in 2004 , leaving it to Hydro@@ -@@ Que@@ bec at its option to pass its responsibility for managing this important hydro@@ electric project worth 5000 million dollars to the private sector .
At the beginning of 2005 the Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce con@@ sortium secured this lu@@ cra@@ tive contract without a prior public call for tender .
As far as the Que@@ bec Party is concerned , rec@@ ourse to company con@@ sor@@ tia poses a serious problem , that of elimination of competition and of an increase of price .
&quot; This is the new way of col@@ lu@@ ding and defe@@ ating competition . &quot;
&quot; This means that rather than be@@ having secre@@ tively , people now be@@ have openly , &quot; declared the Que@@ bec Party dep@@ uty Sil@@ v@@ ain Sim@@ ard at a Press conference .
Ear@@ lier during the morning M. Sim@@ ard raised the question in the National Assembly , because he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in that way .
Re@@ plying in the afternoon , the Minister of Natural Res@@ ources N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au , denied vigor@@ ously any col@@ lu@@ sion in connection with this contract .
&quot; I am starting my journey , &quot; she stor@@ med , maintaining that the Que@@ bec Party had been &quot; dish@@ on@@ est &quot; and &quot; lacking rig@@ our . &quot;
She said that &quot; it would be the least thing &quot; for the Que@@ bec Party to excuse itself .
The formula of the con@@ sor@@ tia is current practice throughout the world .
What is usually involved is an alliance limited over time , which allows two or more companies to combine their respective exper@@ ti@@ ses in order to respond to a call for tender for a complex project .
The E@@ ast@@ main project comprises a high level of complexity , taking into account the extent of the works .
The site is in progress and must extend until 2012 .
The contract was awarded without involving competition ; there were negotiations .
Likewise , the formula of con@@ sor@@ tia is no longer an exception in Que@@ bec , even in respect of relatively simple projects .
As was dis@@ closed last week by Le De@@ voir , the formula of con@@ sor@@ tia in the engineering consultancy sector is the subject of a government inquiry .
A brief inspection of the register of Que@@ bec companies shows the exist@@ ece of over 200 con@@ sor@@ tia , some of which appear to be permanent .
So , for example , the Des@@ se@@ au company works in partnership with the majority of its principal competitors , including C@@ IM@@ A + , G@@ é@@ ni@@ var , S@@ N@@ C-@@ Lav@@ alin and others such as Ro@@ che and T@@ ec@@ su@@ lt .
Every combination and there are tens of them , comes back to one and the same company , namely Des@@ se@@ au .
As far as the Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce con@@ sortium is concerned , Minister Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au stressed that &quot; the territory of the Ba@@ ie James comp@@ lies with the specific labour dynamics and that Hydro@@ -@@ Que@@ bec has complied with them specifically since the nine@@ teen se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
The head of the E@@ ast@@ main project , Ré@@ al La@@ porte of the Soci@@ été d &apos;@@ én@@ ergie de la Ba@@ ie James ( SE@@ B@@ J ) gave an explanation , which raised ey@@ eb@@ rows about the fact that the project management contract had been awarded by mutual agreement .
&quot; If you launch a call for tender and if there are few ten@@ der@@ ers , your prices will be too high . &quot;
&quot; You have two options ; either you accept the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price . &quot; or you take the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfac@@ ti@@ ory alliance and a good price . &quot; we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price . &quot;
&quot; But the idea is that it is not the price which is imp@@ port@@ ant , but people &apos;s skills &quot; stated M. La@@ porte .
This contract awarded to the Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce con@@ sortium , forms part of a long list of contracts of over 50 000 $ secured by the Que@@ bec P@@ s@@ r@@ ty .
The contracts were awarded by Hydro@@ -@@ Que@@ bec or SE@@ B@@ J for the E@@ ast@@ main@@ -@@ 1-@@ A@@ -S@@ ar@@ cel@@ le-@@ Ru@@ per@@ t project .
Following verification , Le De@@ voir counted 10@@ 9 engineering consultancy contracts a@@ we@@ ar@@ ded between 2002 and 2010 to companies or to their subsidiaries , especially soil labor@@ atories .
S@@ N@@ C-@@ Lav@@ alin gra@@ b@@ bed 22 contracts , G@@ é@@ ni@@ var 16 , T@@ ec@@ su@@ lt 14 and Des@@ sau 10 , not counting its participation in E@@ ergie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce .
All the contracts were negotiated .
They total 4@@ 49 7@@ 83 3@@ 44 $ , including the contract awarded to Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce worth 2@@ 95 13@@ 1 5@@ 64 $ .
Sy@@ lv@@ ain Sim@@ ard let it be known that the four companies comp@@ r@@ sing the con@@ sortium ( B@@ PR , Des@@ sau , Group S@@ N and A@@ x@@ or ) are &quot; well known to Que@@ bec Liberal Party . &quot;
Minister Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au let sli@@ p that the Que@@ bec Party is also linked to these companies who &quot; finance &quot; it , before stating that it was rather its directors , who were involved .
Bar@@ ometer of the responsible consumption - the &quot; green &quot; label does not insp@@ ire confidence .
Gre@@ ener , but frank@@ ly scep@@ tical .
The Que@@ bec consumer has little confidence in du@@ rable development players , but also in equ@@ itable brands and in certificates claimed to be ecological , to guide his choice .
Wor@@ se , if he immer@@ ses himself in the universe of the media where messages in favour of more respon@@ si@@ be consumption pul@@ l@@ ulate , he deplo@@ res the lack of reliable information , a piece of negle@@ ct which he even describes as a bra@@ ke on his commitment , indicates the Bar@@ ometer of responsible consumption whose first reading took place today .
Even if they brought about an increase of consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010 , Que@@ bec inhabitants appear to have little faith in those who are trying to sell it to them .
T@@ wo@@ -@@ thirds among them say in effect that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies , or their green publi@@ city dis@@ closing the tool of measurement drawn up by the responsible consumption ob@@ servatory of Sher@@ bro@@ o@@ ke University .
Another finding : Hal@@ f of consumers enter@@ tain doubts concerning the reliability of official certi@@ fications appearing on so-called equ@@ itable products , but also concerning the credibility of products and brands marked as eco-@@ responsible , indicates the Bar@@ ometer .
In the same v@@ ein , the talk of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.@@ 6 % of Que@@ bec inhabitants .
Nevertheless , information concerning responsible consumption appears to be fundamental for the stim@@ ulation of this kind of current consumption by two-@@ thirds of Que@@ bec inhabitants .
In fact , the vacuum and the doub@@ tful nature of the information would cool the ard@@ our of 46 % of consumers .
It is the second most important bra@@ ke after the higher price of these products identified by the Bar@@ ometer .
Moreover , two-@@ thirds of Que@@ bec inhabitants say that they mi@@ str@@ ust the alleged perform@@ am@@ ce of &quot; green &quot; products or services which are being placed in their hands .
On another note , in 2010 almost half the consumers had to change th@@ ir hab@@ its and most importantly to change the brand of one or more of their products , to reflect their conviction .
Up to 61 % of them thus favoured buying from their local shops and preferred foodstuffs grown in their region , indicate the Bar@@ ometer .
Gre@@ ener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Que@@ bec hom@@ o consum@@ us likes to appear as the king of recycling trying to reduce its environmental im@@ print by worrying about the protection of animals .
But its social and ecological conscience nevertheless appears to be restricted to the outside of its vehicle , indicates the Bar@@ ometer : in 2010 , scar@@ c@@ ely 28 % of Que@@ bec inhabitants stated that they used public transport or recommended its use in order to defend their green interests .
Walking and cycling were also supported by 19.@@ 1 % of participants in this huge ba@@ ha@@ vi@@ ou@@ ral inquiry .
A State loan for the purchase of the e@@ X@@ cent@@ ris .
The Que@@ bec government which was asked to become financial involved in the purchase of the e@@ X@@ cent@@ ris cinema complex by the An@@ gu@@ s and Par@@ allel company , agrees to collabor@@ ate , but only in the form of a loan .
The An@@ gu@@ s and Par@@ allel development company which hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to purchase from Daniel Lan@@ glo@@ is the cinema complex e@@ X@@ cent@@ ris on bou@@ levard Saint-@@ Lau@@ rent , restoring to it its full cin@@ em@@ ap@@ hi@@ le vocation , will not secure what they are asking for .
The government agrees to become involved , but on its own conditions .
Rather than the expected donation , the Qu@@ ebe government is offering a loan which will be less than initially expected and which could be a viable solution on advanta@@ geous conditions , at least according to State sources .
A first plan of action and a request for 12.@@ 8 million were already rejected by Que@@ bec last spring , but the requests have since been revised down@@ wards .
A proposal am@@ d an action plan were sent to Minister St@@ -@@ Pierre by the chairman of the Soci@@ été de@@ Dé@@ vel@@ opp@@ ement des Ent@@ re@@ prises Cul@@ turel@@ les ( SO@@ D@@ EC ) Franç@@ ois N@@ ac@@ er@@ ola , who is pi@@ lo@@ ting the e@@ X@@ cen@@ r@@ tic file .
He sent him a final report ten days ago .
But the counter@@ proposal of the cab@@ inet arrived at SO@@ D@@ EC on Tuesday .
Parall@@ è@@ le and An@@ gu@@ s have until 31 December to reply to it .
It nevertheless appears that the assumption of a donation must really be abandoned .
Let us recall that the Associ@@ a@@ it@@ ons of Que@@ bec O@@ wn@@ ers of Cin@@ em@@ as and C@@ ine@@ parks opposed direct State investment to assist the purchase of e@@ X@@ cent@@ ris , argu@@ ing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects , which it did not do for other cin@@ em@@ as .
But several local players , on the other hand , claimed substantial economic help .
Daniel Lan@@ glo@@ is , the pre@@ vi@@ o@@ su owner , supported the author &apos;s cinema on the complex premises after having himself financed its construction , which was able to justify a wai@@ ver by the Treas@@ ury .
There is a cr@@ ying lack of halls for showing independent films in Montreal and e@@ X@@ cent@@ ris knew how to gain the loyalty of its customers .
The An@@ gu@@ s Company and the Par@@ allel , headed by Christian Y@@ acc@@ ar@@ ini , are pi@@ lo@@ ting a private financing campaign , hoping to collect 700 000 $ to make the acqui@@ si@@ ton possible .
Since spring 2009 , one of the three screens , the Par@@ allel , continues to broadcast e@@ X@@ c@@ et@@ ris films .
The aim of future purch@@ as@@ ers is that of re@@ opening the three halls on 27 February , showing the very beautiful film by X@@ avier Beau@@ vo@@ is entitled &quot; Men and Go@@ ds . &quot;
But C@@ ris@@ tian Y@@ acc@@ ar@@ ini has not called back Le De@@ voir and it is not known what he and his Group think about the proposals for a reduction , which have been made to them .
The v@@ eil li@@ fted on a complex Canada ....
The new American diplomatic c@@ ables di@@ vul@@ ged by Wiki@@ le@@ aks have li@@ fted the v@@ eil on what the United States consider to be an in@@ fer@@ i@@ ority complex of Canadi@@ ans towards Americans , but they also betra@@ y a su@@ peri@@ ority complex of the later towards Canada .
Thus , American diplom@@ ats are aston@@ ished that every Canadian elec@@ tor does not have Can@@ ad@@ o-@@ American relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by President Obama helped the Con@@ servative government to have its 2009 budget adopted !
The four new communications between the American emb@@ assy in Ot@@ ta@@ wa and Washington published yesterday , give more sp@@ ic@@ y details to get one &apos;s teeth into .
A cable dated 22 Se@@ tember 2008 , in the very middle of the federal election campaign , tells to what extent the United States form part of the st@@ akes being debated by political leaders .
To the great aston@@ ishment of the American amb@@ assador in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , David Wil@@ k@@ ins .
Mr. Wil@@ k@@ ins offers some explanations of this situation .
&quot; An almost inherent Canadian in@@ fer@@ i@@ ority complex is perhaps in@@ duc@@ ing Canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal st@@ akes , rather than blame this election on the United States ( as during the free exchange campaign of 1988 ) .
The United States therefore are , he concludes , &quot; the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al el@@ eph@@ ant of this election : om@@ ni@@ present , but potentially too threatening to be talked about . &quot;
The amb@@ assador understands this &quot; de@@ af@@ ening silence &quot; all the less , since the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship .
&quot; Lo@@ gi@@ cally , &quot; he feels , &quot; the ability of a candidate , of a party and even more of a party leader to m@@ am@@ age this essential relationship must be a key factor , which the voters have in mind when voting . &quot;
The other expression of this important sen@@ timent is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Ter@@ ry Bre@@ ese , char@@ g@@ é d &apos;@@ aff@@ aires in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ot@@ ta@@ wa .
&quot; Your journey will help ensure the government &apos;s survival of the vote of confidence at the start of February on the federal budget , which will post Canada &apos;s first deficit for over ten years due to a rela@@ unch plan of 30 to 40 thousand million dollars , &quot; writes Mr. Bre@@ ese .
No@@ where can be found any mention that the government had to ad@@ jour@@ n parliament before Christmas to avoid being defe@@ ated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed rela@@ unch plan .
Another communication dated Jan@@ au@@ ry 2008 and signed by amb@@ assador Wil@@ k@@ ins , war@@ ns Washington about the increasingly negative image of the United States conve@@ yed by drama series broad@@ casts by C@@ BC .
The amb@@ assador is worried by broad@@ casts such as B@@ order , Little Mo@@ s@@ que on the Pra@@ i@@ ri@@ e , Intelli@@ ge@@ ce and H@@ 2@@ O , which contain un@@ sub@@ tle references to Mah@@ er Ara@@ r , to the &quot; No F@@ ly List &quot; or again to ki@@ dn@@ app@@ ings for rigorous inter@@ ro@@ gation by the CIA .
Another cable tells that during their first bilateral meeting , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton asked her French opposite number Bern@@ ard K@@ ou@@ chner , whether Europe was ready to receive certain Guant@@ an@@ amo prisoners .
M. K@@ ou@@ chner rep@@ lied &quot; yes , &quot; but on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis .
At the end of the meeting , he wrote , &quot; he handed a paper to the Secretary of State on the subject of O@@ mar K@@ ha@@ d@@ r , a Mo@@ sle@@ m aged 15 of Canadian origin . &quot;
&quot; The Secretary agreed to review the case . &quot;
It should be noted in conclusion that tem@@ pers became heated about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
Tom Flan@@ agan , an former adv@@ iser very close to Stephen Har@@ per , declared on C@@ BC waves that the person responsible for this massive le@@ ak should be &quot; as@@ ass@@ inated . &quot;
He echo@@ ed Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e in the United States .
A worldwide plan for rene@@ wing lighting .
Yesterday at Can@@ cu@@ n UNO put forward a plan of renovation of domestic , commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to securing a reduction of greenhouse gases ( G@@ ES ) corresponding to almost one-@@ third of the additional reduction needed to stabili@@ se the planet &apos;s climate by 2020 .
This ambitious plan is one of a number of concrete projects , which UNO hopes to have adopted at Can@@ cu@@ n to offset the absence of mandatory reduction undertakings by industri@@ alised countries .
According to the plan tabled yesterday , if inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs , which still hold 50 to 70 % of the market , were replaced by flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs , or better still , by elec@@ trol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent dio@@ de bul@@ bs ( D@@ EL or LED in English ) , the bulk of the 1.@@ 8 thousand million tonnes of G@@ ES emit@@ ted on the planet to provide ill@@ um@@ ination for human beings , would be avoided .
I@@ ll@@ um@@ ination is responsible for 8 % of worldwide emissions .
This is the equivalent of 70 % of the emissions by the world &apos;s motor vehicles .
Last year at Copenhagen the high emissions countries such as the United States , China , Europe and others including Canada , adopted voluntary plans of reduction to bring down global emissions of G@@ ES from 53 G@@ t to 49 G@@ t .
But it will be necessary to sub@@ tract from this figure a further 5 G@@ t to stabili@@ se the increase of climate warming by 2020 at 2 ° C in order to avoid loss of control .
In inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs 95 % of energy is dis@@ si@@ p@@ ated in the form of heat and only the remaining 5 % produce light .
With flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs , the dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation of energy is reduced by 75 % and with the new D@@ EL bul@@ bs , the energy requirement is addi@@ tionally reduced by double that amount .
Flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs last on an average between 6@@ 000 and 10 000 hours .
The new D@@ EL bul@@ bs such as those launched by Phili@@ ps this week , Phili@@ ps having mo@@ re@@ po@@ ver participated in a UNO study , have a life expec@@ tan@@ cy of 25 000 hours and consu@@ me 80 % less energy than inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs , giving an idea of the saving , which would be possible in a plan of replacement applicable to 100 countries .
These entirely novel bul@@ bs can also work with r@@ he@@ o@@ stat@@ s , emit@@ ting very little heat .
And they contain no mer@@ cury .
Several specialists have voic@@ ed rever@@ v@@ ations concerning flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs , because they contain mer@@ cury and because it is necessary to dis@@ pose of them as dangerous waste , which is not always possible in developing countries , unless the manufacturers issue instructions .
But , states the report , the principal source of mer@@ cury emission on the planet is not the flu@@ o@@ comp@@ ast bul@@ b , but rather carbon thermal emission centres , which em@@ it a lot of mer@@ cury to produce the electricity wa@@ sted in inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs .
In the United States alone , these centres em@@ it 25 000 tonnes of mer@@ cury a year .
The report details the gains , which every country would achieve through this international programme .
For example , Indonesia would save a thousand million dollars a year on purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 , the equivalent of 3.5 thermal centres , whose construction would cost 2.5 thousand million dollars .
I@@ vor@@ y Coast is ner@@ v@@ ously expecting the announcement of the election results .
The UNO Secretary-General , B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon , has called for the publication &quot; without delay &quot; of the results of the I@@ vor@@ y Coast presidential election , on the exp@@ iry of the set period .
&quot; The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provi@@ sional results without further delay &quot; stressed a spo@@ kes@@ man for the head of UNO . &quot;
&quot; He asks all I@@ vor@@ y Coast parties and institutions to show responsibility and to absta@@ in from any initiatives pending the ann@@ ou@@ cement of the provi@@ sional results . &quot;
Despite pressures exer@@ ted by certain foreign governments , the electoral commission has allowed th target date of Wednesday mid@@ night to pass , without publishing the results three days after the Sunday voting .
About for@@ ty minutes before the exp@@ iry of the set period the president of the independent electoral commission &quot; continued to work &quot; on the announ@@ b@@ cement of the results .
Throughout the world , calls became more frequent on Wednesday for the electoral commission finally to declare the name of the winner of the second round , Lau@@ rent G@@ bag@@ bo or his oppon@@ en@@ ent Al@@ ass@@ ane Ou@@ att@@ ara .
But the G@@ bag@@ bo camp is counting ont he cancellation by the Constitutional Council of &quot; frau@@ dul@@ ent &quot; votes in the north , received by the ex-@@ reb@@ els of the New For@@ ces ( F@@ N ) since the failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in September 2002 .
Pas@@ cal Aff@@ i N &apos;@@ Bu@@ ess@@ an , campaign director of the I@@ vor@@ y Coast president , stated that the man@@ œ@@ eu@@ v@@ res of intim@@ id@@ ation of elec@@ tors by the F@@ N in the north of the country had dis@@ su@@ aded the parti@@ sans of the leaving president from voting .
Any election could be ann@@ ul@@ led , if complaints by G@@ ha@@ g@@ bo are accepted by the Constitutional Council .
G@@ bag@@ bo &apos;s enemies alle@@ ge that the highest Court of the cou@@ try is not im@@ partial , since it is pre@@ sided by Paul Y@@ ao N &apos;@@ Dr@@ é , a close political ally of G@@ bag@@ bo .
Al@@ ass@@ ane Ou@@ att@@ ara , the man from the north , who den@@ ies any links with the ex-@@ reb@@ els , has described as &quot; unacceptable &quot; the delay in making the announcement of the results and has asked G@@ bag@@ bo to respect them , but has not gone so far as to claim victory .
His allies state that G@@ bag@@ bo is blocking the publication of the results , because he knows that he lost and that compla@@ ining to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from publishing the results , would be illegal .
The second round of voting in the presidential election on Sunday was thought to have cro@@ wn@@ ed the process of re@@ unification and of reconciliation of a country split in two for years .
On Wednesday UNO warned the I@@ vor@@ y Coast political class that it might be held res@@ po@@ on@@ sible for any violence .
Lau@@ rent G@@ bag@@ bo finished at the top in the first round on 11 October , with 38 % of votes against 32 % for Al@@ ass@@ ane Ou@@ att@@ ara , who received the public support of the former pres@@ dient Hen@@ ri Kon@@ an Be@@ di@@ é ( 25 % in the fir@@ ts round ) .
The rate of unemployment in France has remained stable in the 3rd quarter .
The rate of unemployment in France according to the International Labour Office has remained stable at 9.@@ 3 % in metro@@ politan France ( 9.@@ 7 % taking into account overseas Dé@@ parte@@ ments ) tr@@ n@@ spi@@ res from data corrected for provi@@ sional seasonal variations ( CV@@ S ) published on TH@@ urs@@ day by the In@@ see .
The number of unemployed is 2.@@ 6@@ 31 million in metro@@ politan France .
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.@@ 3 % of native working population and 9.@@ 7 of the DO@@ M .
Over one year , unemployment has risen by 0.@@ 1 points .
Seen more broadly , 3.@@ 4 million persons in metro@@ politan France are not working during the third quarter but wish to work , whether they are , or are not available for work within two weeks and whether or not they are looking for work .
T@@ e position of the young in the labour market has wor@@ sen@@ ed with a fresh rise in the unemployment rate to 24.@@ 2 % in metro@@ politan France ( + , 9.@@ 2 points over three months + 0.5 points over the year ) and 25 % including the DO@@ M .
In the third quarter , 6@@ 37 000 young people between 15 and 24 were unemployed ( B@@ IT ) .
Ol@@ der people experienced a slight rise of unemployment to 6.@@ 4 % in metro@@ politan France ( + 0.@@ 2 points over three months and over a year ) , equal to 4@@ 82 000 persons of 50 or over and 6.@@ 6 % for the DO@@ M .

Since 2006 , the In@@ see no longer publi@@ shes the mon@@ n@@ h@@ ly unemployment rate , following arguments about its method of calculation .
On the other hand , Eurostat , the statistical agency of the Euro@@ ean Union , continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.@@ 8 % for France ( DO@@ M included ) in October after 9.@@ 9 % in September .
Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini is under arrest
Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini , 53 , director of waste processing companies and brother of the president of General Council of Bou@@ ch@@ es-@@ du@@ -@@ Rh@@ one , was arrested and sent to Lu@@ yn@@ es prison near Ai@@ x-@@ en-@@ Provence in the context of an investigation of public contracts pre@@ sum@@ ed frau@@ dul@@ ent .
According to his att@@ or@@ ney , Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini is accused of the abu@@ sive use of company property , the the@@ ft public funds , of receiving st@@ olen goods , of active corruption and of the sale of influence .
&quot; Alex@@ ande Gu@@ er@@ ein@@ i is comb@@ ative and is willing to answer any questions which the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate may ask , but not fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es . &quot;
&quot; It is easy to acc@@ use him of a number of re@@ prehen@@ sible actions , but quite another to prove them &quot; declared his att@@ or@@ ney , Florence Rau@@ lt , to AP@@ F , before her client &apos;s hearing .
M. Gu@@ er@@ ini , brother of the strong man of the socialist party in the dé@@ partement , Jean-@@ No@@ el Gu@@ er@@ ini , passed to his judge prior to his hearing through his att@@ or@@ ney an explanatory memor@@ an@@ dum .
One of his intim@@ ates , Phili@@ ppe Rap@@ e@@ zzi was also de@@ tained on W@@ ed esday even@@ eing .
According to his att@@ or@@ ney , Me Lu@@ ci@@ en Simon , his client never did anything other than perform his duties .
Conc@@ erning the award of contracts or the destination of the related funds , he had no knowledge of them , said Me Simon .
In this matter , Daniel P@@ inn@@ a , formerly direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of servi@@ es of the Au@@ b@@ agne con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation was de@@ tained for ques@@ tioning on Wednesday concerning the the@@ ft of public funds and complic@@ ity and released on police ba@@ il , coupled with a prohi@@ bition on meeting any persons involved in the case .
&quot; My client has given explanations of the alleg@@ ations against him . &quot;
2 &quot; The examining ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate took this into account and did not depri@@ ve him of his freedom , &quot; said his att@@ or@@ ney , Me Y@@ ann Arn@@ ou@@ x .
Four other persons were de@@ tained for ques@@ tioning and released during the night of Tuesday to Wedn@@ mes@@ day , two of them on ba@@ il , said the assi@@ stant public prosec@@ utor , Michel R@@ aff@@ in .
Michel Kar@@ ab@@ ad@@ j@@ ak@@ ian , assi@@ stant direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of the clean@@ sing@@ of Mar@@ sei@@ lle Province Metrop@@ ole ( MP@@ M ) is being prosec@@ uted for &quot; sale of influence and passive corruption . &quot;
Two func@@ tion@@ aries of the Au@@ b@@ agne con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation . Mich@@ è@@ le Du@@ val and Christop@@ he Br@@ ingu@@ ier , were arrested and qu@@ ation@@ ed one concerning the &quot; the@@ ft of public property by a person responsible for public service &quot; and the other concerning &quot; complic@@ ity in the the@@ ft of public funds . &quot;
Lastly , the compan@@ ion of Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini , Je@@ anne Per@@ etti was ques@@ tioned concerning &quot; receiving st@@ olen company rop@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
Among persons confronted with M. Gu@@ er@@ ini is Steph@@ ane Brun@@ en@@ go@@ -@@ Gir@@ ard , rec@@ et@@ ly arrested in a parallel affair concerning frau@@ dul@@ ent public contracts involving Cor@@ si@@ ca .
Investi@@ g@@ ators suspect his companies of having served for large-scale money la@@ undering .
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several Court investigations of X in April 2009 following anonymous letters concerning pre@@ sum@@ ed fraud relating to public contracts , in particular for waste disposal .
According to a source close to the inquiry , the investigations concentrate in particular on the conditions of the award and functioning of a discharge of La Ci@@ ot@@ at , which collec@@ ts Au@@ b@@ agne waste as well as the waste from certain towns of the urban community of Mar@@ sei@@ lle ( MP@@ M ) .
Aff@@ air of Clo@@ thil@@ de Rei@@ ss : The Elys@@ ée has exagger@@ ated the involvement of Syria
During over ten months , from July 2009 to May 2010 , the fate of Clo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss , the young French re@@ se@@ er@@ ch worker arrested in Iran for &quot; es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , &quot; ms@@ de France hold its bre@@ ath , al@@ er@@ ted diplomacy and under@@ lined the deterioration of rel@@ ati@@ ions between Paris and Teh@@ er@@ an .
All under the careful scrutiny of United States diplom@@ ats .
American documents obtained by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks and consulted by Le Mon@@ de , reveal some of the background of this crisis .
They describe how the Elys@@ ée explained its strategy to the Americans , going so far as to give them advice on the treatment of their own &quot; ho@@ stage &quot; in Iran crises ( a small group of tri@@ p@@ pers ) .
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Fren@@ ch@@ woman was not balanced by the release of Maj@@ id Kak@@ av@@ and , an Iranian under arrest in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme .
Lastly , they place in a g@@ lar@@ ing light the way in which the French presidency tried to manip@@ ulate the media to give cre@@ dence of the idea that the Syri@@ an president , Bach@@ ar Al-@@ As@@ sad played a central part in the release of Clo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss .
In reality , he had not done anything .
A diplomatic cable sent on 12 August 2009 to Paris is entitled &quot; Iran : French comments on how to manage cases of host@@ ages . &quot;
The Elys@@ ée adv@@ iser on strategic matters , Franç@@ ois Rich@@ ier , accompanied by the director of Qu@@ ai d &apos;@@ Or@@ say for North Africa and the Middle East , Patri@@ ce Pa@@ oli , had a discussion with the American diplom@@ at , K@@ athle@@ en Ale@@ gr@@ one .
They explained to her the French method .
They advised the Americans to arrange to re@@ patri@@ ate their own nationals de@@ tained in Iran .
&quot; Make a lot of noise , &quot; they said , &quot; ham@@ mer ceas@@ el@@ ess@@ ly the words &quot; fundamental rights of man , &quot; &quot; inno@@ c@@ ence &quot; and &quot; immediate release &quot; in the media . &quot;
&quot; You must not embar@@ ra@@ ss the Iranian regime , which is sensitive to its image . &quot;
&quot; Do it all the more when the Iran@@ ians ask you not to . &quot;
Because after attempts to discuss the matter through discre@@ et channels have failed , silence will not solve anything , the Iran@@ ians being past@@ -@@ masters of dela@@ ying tac@@ tics . &quot;
M. Rich@@ ier adds that arre@@ sting foreigners is a familiar Iranian tac@@ tic , taking host@@ ages for political black@@ mail .
He announced that ther@@ ele@@ ase of Clo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss from prison ( which will take place on 16 August , the day on which she took refuge in the French emb@@ assy ) would involve paying the Iran@@ ians a large sum of money ( 230 000 E@@ ur as a caution ) .
And he advised that the Elys@@ ée expected other ho@@ stage crises , a phenomenon which would get worse .
He said that the Iran@@ ians might arrest in the near future another of some 1800 French citizens who live in Iran .
28@@ .@@ 8.@@ 09
Clo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss has been out of prison for twelve days , but is unable to leave Iran .
A piece of information was broadcast : the Iranian Maj@@ id Kak@@ av@@ and , whose extra@@ dition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic material to Iran the United States are demanding , was fre@@ ed in Paris by a Court .
According to numerous observers , the American emb@@ assy is considering this worrying coinci@@ dence .
For Washington which tracks Iranian illegal nuclear material acquisition networks , the release of Maj@@ id K@@ ha@@ k@@ av@@ g@@ and is bad news .
Has France accepted a deal ?
The release of the Iranian against that of the Fren@@ ch@@ woman ?
During the conversation with K@@ athle@@ en Alle@@ gr@@ one on 4 September , Franç@@ ois Rich@@ ier gave an assurance that this was not the case .
He said that he Elys@@ ée was not only completely surprised by the Ju@@ dge &apos;s ruling , but also tried to oppose it .
He said that there were lively exchanges bet@@ wen the French presidency and and the Gar@@ de des S@@ ce@@ aux at the time , Mich@@ è@@ le Alli@@ ot-@@ Mar@@ ie@@ . but the French government could not change the Court ruling .
M. Rich@@ ier also wants to demonstrate that Maj@@ id Kak@@ av@@ and continues under close surv@@ ei@@ l@@ ance by the French secret service .
The Elys@@ ée adv@@ iser di@@ als a number , han@@ gs up and then inform@@ s the American diplom@@ at that the Iranian is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian emb@@ assy .
During Clo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss &apos; detention in Iran , the Elys@@ ée did not control its efforts by means of comm@@ uni@@ ques and media &quot; le@@ aks &quot; to create the impression that the Syri@@ an pe@@ sident Bach@@ ar Al-@@ As@@ sad was playing the important and influential part of an intermedi@@ ary .
The Americans observe this activity without ir@@ ony and find that manipulation bears fruit because several Press articles repeat the official French version .
A tele@@ gram dated 25 August 2009 men@@ tions the media &quot; bli@@ tz &quot; by French officials .
On what is based so much &quot; gratitude &quot; e@@ pressed to M. As@@ sad , asks the Paris emb@@ assy .
Not@@ with@@ standing their declarations full of praise , French officials priv@@ ately admit that they only have the v@@ agu@@ est notion of what the Syri@@ ans really did .
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elys@@ ée put out this fiction .
It states that the intensive effort of communication tries to vali@@ date Sarkozy &apos;s policy of moving closer to Syria .
A policy launched in 2008 , which was seen by many critics in France and abroad as being pre@@ mature and without merit .
By exagger@@ ating the part played by Syria , Paris is trying to show Syria how much praise it could gain by playing a constructive part in the region .
The objective is also that of so@@ wing seeds of dis@@ cor@@ d bet@@ wen Syria and Iran .
The American emb@@ assy knows this from a reliable source .
On 11 August , Franç@@ ois Rich@@ ier confi@@ ded him that the French did not of course know whether the Syri@@ ans had done anything .. &quot; bien s@@ û@@ r , nous ne sav@@ ons pas si les Syri@@ ens ont fa@@ it qu@@ oi que ce so@@ it . &quot;
But that they still than@@ ked them .
This might at least conf@@ use the Iran@@ ians .
Clo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss returns to France on 16 May 2010
N@@ I@@ col@@ as Sarkozy receives her at the Elys@@ ée .
In a comm@@ unique , he thanks the pre@@ sidents fo Brazil , Sen@@ egal and Syria for their &quot; active role in favour of the release of our comp@@ atri@@ ot . &quot;
No on-line games for young Kore@@ ans after mid@@ night .
According to government authorities , the South Korean govern@@ em@@ t will pass a law called &quot; Cin@@ der@@ ella , &quot; which will prohi@@ bit ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents from playing on-line games after mid@@ night by means of bo@@ cking their access .
According to represent@@ a@@ it@@ ves of the Mini@@ stries of Culture and Family , a draft law will be submitted to parliament in December to ask on-line game companies to block access of ju@@ ven@@ ies under 16 to their games after mid@@ night .
A lot of children play these games all night and then experience difficulties in studying at school and in living a normal life in day@@ time .
&quot; We think that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep , &quot; declared to AF@@ P J@@ o R@@ in , the Minister in charge of pi@@ lo@@ ting the draft law .
On@@ -@@ line games will now be accessible at 6 a.m .
The Minister stated that the companies would have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law .
He added that the government would also ask the companies to limit the daily time of access to these games by young people whose parents have asked for this to be done .
He would also make available to people requesting it , free-@@ of-@@ charge software making it possible to limit time spent on Internet .
South Korea is one of the most &quot; connected &quot; countries and the newspapers regularly report various facts linked to an intensive use of the Internet .
The country is also the un@@ disp@@ uted champion of worldwide online game competitions .
In November , South Korea won four gold me@@ d@@ als at World Cy@@ ber Games in a contest of 58 other nations .
World champ@@ ion@@ ships 20@@ 18-@@ 20@@ 22 : Fi@@ fa ap@@ points organising countries .
Tor@@ ment due to suspec@@ ted corruption . On Thursday , the executive committee of Fi@@ fa will appoint countries to organise World Cup matches in 20@@ 18 and 20@@ 22 , an emin@@ ently poli@@ t@@ cal choice , where influence and lob@@ b@@ ying batt@@ les are liable to take prec@@ e@@ dence of technical criteria .
One thing is certain ; the 20@@ 18 edition of the Fi@@ fa competition will take place in Europe , the traditional bas@@ tion of the game ( 4 candidates , Great Britain , Russia , Spa@@ in-@@ Portugal and Belgi@@ um-@@ The Netherlands ; An@@ gle@@ ter@@ re , Rus@@ sie , Esp@@ ag@@ ne-@@ Portugal , Pa@@ ys@@ -B@@ as-@@ Belgi@@ que ) .
That of 20@@ 22 will be a lot more exotic , Fi@@ fa hoping to con@@ quer new territories ( Qu@@ atar , Australia ) after a first contest on the African continent in 2010 or to pursue its introduction into the USA , or the Far East ( Japan , South Korea ) .
The list of person@@ alities of the delegations ( David Cam@@ eron , Price William , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez Zap@@ ater@@ o , J@@ ose So@@ crates , Bill Clinton , the E@@ mir of Q@@ atar , the heads of the Belgian and Dutch governments , Zi@@ dan@@ e , B@@ eck@@ ham , Cru@@ y@@ ff ) give an idea of the economic and political st@@ akes of a world competition .
Behin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes bar@@ gaining may therefore last up to the last minute .
For the rest , it is difficult to establish a hierarch@@ y among the candidates .
According to a Fi@@ fa assessment report , the British , Span@@ ish@@ -@@ Portuguese ( 20@@ 18 ) and American ( 20@@ 22 ) cases advance better arguments than their competitors .
But these considerations will not wei@@ gh very heavily with the 22 members of the executive committee , when it comes to voting .
The Sunday Times whi@@ ose dis@@ clo@@ sures resulted in the suspension of two members of the executive committee ( Re@@ yn@@ ald Tem@@ eri@@ i and A@@ mos Adam@@ u ) , might thus have ru@@ ined the chances of its country , the cra@@ dle of football , which only hosted the World Cup once , in 1966 .
On Monday the BBC broadcast a documentary concerning three influential members of the executive committee , Ric@@ ardo Tei@@ zei@@ ra , Nicolas Le@@ o@@ z and I@@ ssa Ha@@ y@@ at@@ ou .
Up@@ setting Fi@@ fa and embar@@ ra@@ sing the British representatives , who engaged in intensive lob@@ b@@ ying in recent weeks , mainly through David B@@ eck@@ ham .
The head of the British government hopes to repeat the coup of his pre@@ d@@ ess@@ es@@ or Tony Blair , who in 2005 secured the choice of London as the venue of the 2012 Olympic Games .
Will this intensive activity suff@@ ice to re@@ guil@@ d the shi@@ eld of England in the eyes of the executive committee ?
Nothing is less certain , because the Spa@@ in-@@ Portugal du@@ o does not lack for advantages , with its sta@@ dia already completed , its expertise ( World Cup 82 in Spain , 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona , Euro 2004 in Portugal ) and its football culture .
But the som@@ bre economic and financial prospects of the two countries could pour cold water on their ambitions .
Po@@ s@@ sible re@@ pris@@ als against the British and doubts about the solven@@ cy of Spain and Portugal can only improve the standing of Russia , which has become a powerful out@@ si@@ der , despite its lacks ( sta@@ dia , hotels , transport ) .
But the Prime Minister V@@ ladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and den@@ ounced &quot; unfair competition in the preparation of voting &quot; in a vei@@ led reference to accus@@ ations in the British Press against members of the executive committee .
&quot; They are being sp@@ at@@ tered with mu@@ d and attempts are being made to compromise them , &quot; alleged Mr. Putin .
Conc@@ erning 20@@ 22 , the United States with exper@@ ein@@ ce of 1994 , appear the obvious favou@@ rites .
The leading world ec@@ om@@ om@@ ic power , the seat of the principal spon@@ sors of Fi@@ fa , the country appears to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea who have separately built a very fine project .
But these new candi@@ dat@@ ures appear pre@@ mature for two countries , which jointly organised the 2002 trial .
Another threat : The award of the 20@@ 26 World Competition to China , ard@@ ently desired by Fi@@ fa , which will in fact ext@@ ingu@@ ish Asian chances for 20@@ 22 .
Conc@@ erning Q@@ atar which has made great play of proposing fut@@ ur@@ istic sta@@ dia and Australia , Fi@@ fa would pursue its expansion into new regions , but these two countries offer more risk than certainty .
Like Japan and South Korea , Australia could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights of European countries , the ner@@ ve centre of the war for Fi@@ fa .
Second mandate : the evidence
De Gaulle really hesit@@ ated .
Mit@@ ter@@ and made others believe that he hesit@@ ated .
Val@@ ery G@@ is@@ card d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing and Jacques Chirac had not the sligh@@ test he@@ si@@ tation .
And Nicolas Sak@@ o@@ zy still fewer than they .
An Elys@@ ée mandate tells a different story .
Accordingly , the current head of State will be a candidate in 2012 .
But the evidence conflicts with the my@@ sti@@ que of the presidential function .
It is now necessary to pre@@ tend that the doubt had always existed .
In one sense as in the other .
In 2006 , even without belie@@ ving it , friends of Jacques Chirac pre@@ tended that a third mandate was not excluded .
On 15 November with a grave air , Nicolas Sarkozy gave an assurance that he would make his decision &quot; some@@ time in the autumn of 2011 &quot;
The fact that on Tuesday night at the Elys@@ ée before UM@@ P de@@ pu@@ ties he called up the prospect of &quot; two mand@@ ates &quot; so@@ wed some fe@@ ver@@ ish refle@@ ctions .
Was this the official ann@@ ou@@ cement of his candi@@ dat@@ ure ?
Far from it .
The president only rec@@ alled that the 2008 revised con@@ sti@@ ution limited the number of five-@@ year terms to only two .
He stated facts , but he did not make an announcement .
This is not for the first time that he hum@@ or@@ ously men@@ tions the presidential election at such meetings .
He said in July 2009 that at best they only had another seven and a half years of him .
Re@@ bel@@ ote in May 2010 : Do not believe that I only thought about it afterwards
His intentions of the day before yesterday did not make him any more or any less a candidate than those of the day before that .
If they occasion comments , the reason is tw@@ o@@ fold .
On the one hand , the acceler@@ ation of the progress of the candi@@ dat@@ ure of the socialist party .
But it is not the entry into the lists of Seg@@ ol@@ ene Royal , which pus@@ hes Nicolas Sarkozy to un@@ mask himself .
The reason is , on the contrary , that his 2012 candi@@ dat@@ ure is clearly what many members of the socialist party are calling for , an earlier plan of battle than one originally planned .
The bad p@@ olls , on the other hand .
For the first time , voters on the right preferred the candi@@ dat@@ ure of Franç@@ ois F@@ illon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy ( 45 % against 44 % , according to EV@@ A-@@ L &apos;@@ Express ) .
The ent@@ ou@@ rage of the Prime Minister immediately said that it had a candidate and that there was no debate about this within UM@@ P .
Jean-@@ Pierre R@@ aff@@ arin said that if he , the candidate , believed that defeat was a possibility , he would not be a candidate .
Ala@@ in Ju@@ pp@@ é said in the face of evidence and by way of correction that the candidate would always believe that he could win .
Euro : B@@ CE comp@@ elled to buy State securities
The last annual meeting of the board of govern@@ ors of the European Central Bank ( B@@ CE ) had to be the occasion of speci@@ fying the methods of emerging from the crisis , or at least of announ@@ cing the end of a good number of un@@ conventional monetary policy operations , which have to be completed by the year end .
The European sovereign debt crisis obli@@ ges the issuing institute in Frankfurt to ba@@ have less per@@ emp@@ tori@@ ly , on pain of ag@@ grav@@ ating the situation , which is now more than ten@@ se enough already on European markets of obligation .
The political cost would be all the higher .
Yesterday at a Press conference , the French Minister of Finance , Christ@@ ine Lag@@ ar@@ de gre@@ eted the active role played by the B@@ CE to resolve the debt crisis of European States .
She did not wish to say whether she thought that the Central Bank had to do more , for example , by increasing its programme of buying sovereign bonds .
She said that she would communicate her thoughts to her European partners .
In Brussels on the day before during his hearing before the economic and monetary affairs commission of the European parliament , the chairman of the B@@ CE , Jean-@@ Claude T@@ rich@@ et did not prove more diff@@ use about his intentions , cont@@ enting himself with saying that the programme of buying State securities in the secondary market would continue and that they would see what will be decided at the meeting on Thursday .
The only certainty : The B@@ CE would keep its principal rate of interest un@@ changed at 1 % , histor@@ ically the lowest since May 2009 .
F@@ actually , the obligatory Treas@@ ury purchases by the B@@ CE doub@@ led during last week to almost 1.@@ 35 thousand million Euros .
And , according to in@@ discre@@ tions of market operators , it made fresh purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday .
In total , Euro@@ system central banks bought 67 thousand millions &apos; worth of Euros since May 2010 .
There is no doubt among market operators about the expectations of a pursuit of purchases ( see page 29 ) .
Econom@@ ists no longer expect any marked change of cap .
Whilst loan operations at over three months have already disappeared from the B@@ CE Bank ar@@ senal , the latter continues to grant unlimited cash loans on generous terms and for periods from one we@@ ke to three months .
Econom@@ ists now expect that the facility will be extended by some months .
Michael Schu@@ bert , an econom@@ ist at Commer@@ z@@ bank cannot imagine that it will modify it pro@@ gra@@ me to any great extent .
He says that this would cause new short-term tensions .
Nor@@ best B@@ rä@@ ms , an econom@@ ist at S@@ al says that a gradual exit to be announced during the fir@@ ts quarter of 2011 appears more likely .
O@@ ppen@@ heim .
Nor@@ bet B@@ rä@@ ms adds that on the level of its interventions in the public debt market , the B@@ CE would have to make purchases of these bonds adequately large to revi@@ ve the lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e market .
Taking into account the large exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets of the Euro zone , the issuing institute has no option other than to maintain a presence in the market .
An important bonds manager said yesterday that the Bank must at all costs off@@ sat the shortage of investors in the market and prevent a boom of payments by the most vulnerable States .
Because if interest rates take off , States will be all the more anxi@@ ous to reduce their in@@ deb@@ te@@ dness , or to stabili@@ se it .
This is the price of safeguarding the Euro .
In Italy , the Berlusconi government is turning its back .
After the start of a dis@@ qui@@ eting week for Italy , the situation yesterday was somewhat easier with the re@@ flu@@ x of 10-@@ year obligatory rates .
Retur@@ n to prec@@ arious calm .
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy , the regional pre@@ sidents said that Gi@@ uli@@ o Tre@@ mon@@ ti described the situation as &quot; in@@ sol@@ ub@@ le &quot; and that he was waiting for an un@@ fore@@ see@@ able weekend , which he subsequently denied .
In any event on Tuesday the difference between German long-term rates reached a record of 2@@ 10 base points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bank@@ rupt@@ cy ( CD@@ S ) took off to reach 26@@ 3 points , producing a certain amount of pan@@ ic in Rome .
At a session of the council of ministers , Sil@@ vio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the differ@@ ential from German rates was over 400 base points .
But his right arm , Gi@@ anni L@@ etta , declared himself very worried by market tur@@ bul@@ ence and by a possible con@@ ta@@ gion from Ireland .
The good news is that Italy , the third largest economy of the Eurozone , is not like Greece and Ireland .
According to Ir@@ win Ste@@ zer , an ec@@ on@@ o@@ ist at the Hu@@ d@@ son Institute , the bad news is that it is like Portugal .
Clearly , its problem is an absence of growth and inadequate tax revenues , placing the State in in danger of no longer being able to cover its financial requirements .
The most recent forecasts from Brussels acted like a cold shower on the government .
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1 % in 2011 and 1.4 % in 2012 , wh@@ ist the budget now under scrutiny by the Sen@@ ate records 1.3 and 2.0 % respectively .
Under these conditions , the European Commission calcul@@ ates that the public deficit will be 4.@@ 3 % of the GDP next year ( ver@@ sus 3.@@ 9 % forecast by the government ) and 3.5 % in 2012 ( instead of the forecast of 2.@@ 7 % ) .
This is the reason for the rum@@ our of a new collective budget of 7 thousand million Euros , which might be drawn up after the holidays .
The economic affairs commission@@ er O@@ ll@@ i Rehn said that if necessary , new austerity measures will have to be taken .
For the moment , Italy receives support from international institutions .
Arri@@ go Sad@@ un , the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF assu@@ res that the foundations of Italian economy are sound .
P@@ ier Carlo P@@ ado@@ an , chief econom@@ ist of O@@ C@@ DE , states that there is no problem in the immediate future , in the short or in the long term , because despite its large debt ( 1@@ 19.@@ 2 % of G@@ IP in 2011 , N@@ DL@@ R ) . stabili@@ sation efforts demanded from Italy are smaller than those demanded from other countries .
There remains the question of political instability .
On 14 December , Sil@@ vio Berlusconi will face a motion of c@@ ensure in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , following which an early general election could take place at the end of March .
A period not suited to the taking of decisions in the event of a serious crisis would then begin .
Europeans are thinking about means of strengthening anti-@@ crisis devices .
Christ@@ ine Lag@@ ar@@ de ham@@ mer@@ ed the following home yesterday at a Press conference in Paris : She said that she believed Europeans showed on Sunday both day and night that they are committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone .
Although that it was only relative , the de@@ ten@@ te recorded here yesterday of interest rates on European State bonds brought water to the m@@ ills of governments and of the B@@ CE .
But one cannot yet speak about a start of normali@@ sation .
The Standard &amp; Po@@ or agency announced that it might de@@ value the Portuguese debt , the target of most of today &apos;s speculation .
The economists of Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ bas feel that as in May , there is a real lack of clarity and political transparency en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ing banking systems in particular .
All the more because political time moves much more slowly than market time .
A@@ ware of this gap and of the dangers which it conce@@ als , European countries are intensi@@ fying their discussions aimed at strengthening their existing anti-@@ crisis devices .
Inform@@ al consultations between Ministers of Finance of countries most directly concerned and more widely their G20 opposite numbers , are well advanced .
And also in the expec@@ tation of meetings of the Euro@@ group and the Eco@@ fin at the start of next week .
The B@@ CE is meeting today .
On the agenda is the fate of un@@ conventional measures of support for countries of the Eurozone in the market col@@ li@@ mat@@ or ( see above ) .
Conc@@ erning the European financial stability fund ( F@@ ES@@ F ) its executive director Klaus Reg@@ ling began a tour of Asia starting from Singapore , to inform Far East investors about the progress of the crisis i Europe .
Whilst the object of these visits is not to raise funds , it is certainly intended to prepare the ground for doing so .
The first issues of F@@ ES@@ F bonds are expected to take place next month .
Yesterday , an official American representative told Re@@ uter that the United States would support a possible increase of funds for direct supplementary involvement of the IMF .
Front line cou@@ tries such as Spain and Portugal are preparing to adopt structural reforms , particularly concerning organisation of the labour market .
Re@@ forms which are additional to measures of austerity with a more rapid effect .
Lisbon and Madrid wish to embar@@ k on a path different from that taken by Greece and Ireland .
Both are anxi@@ ous to avoid in any circumstances asking for international help , before introducing its own budgetary correc@@ tives and deciding on structural reforms essential for restoring long-term confidence .
Lastly , back@@ ers of European funds are discussing available options to speed up the process of normali@@ sation of sovereign debt markets .
In Paris on 24 November , A@@ xel Weber first put forward the idea that if the 750 thousand million Euros released by Europe and the IMF were not adequate , the Un@@ n@@ ion would not hesitate to resort to the portfolio .
Econom@@ ists at Bar@@ cla@@ y Capital , a top Eure@@ op@@ ean sovereign debt market player , feel that an increase of about 100 thousand million Euros , prefer@@ ably in the form of a direct cash injection , would suff@@ ice .
The vehicle exists : The vehicle exists in the form of the European financial stabili@@ sation mechanism , currently containing 60 thousand million Euros .
A piece of advice likely to be examined carefully in European capit@@ als .
Most importantly , if market conditions prevail .
S@@ now and ice : 24 dé@@ parte@@ ments have received an orange warning .
Ep@@ iso@@ des of snow are still causing traffic problems , especially in the secondary network in B@@ ritt@@ any and may dis@@ rupt certain economic activities .
T@@ w@@ enty-@@ four dé@@ parte@@ ments are on orange alert due to a risk of snow and ice .
E@@ ure , Eu@@ re-@@ et-@@ Lo@@ ir , D@@ eu@@ x@@ -S@@ è@@ v@@ res ad Vi@@ enne have joined the 20 dé@@ parte@@ ments already on orange alert , 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two , Dor@@ do@@ gne and Gir@@ on@@ de , later during the night .
According to Me@@ te@@ o France , continuous fl@@ ur@@ ries of snow are affecting the north of the Gir@@ on@@ de and both Char@@ entes and it is sno@@ wing ligh@@ tly over the I@@ le de France .
De@@ posi@@ ts of snow from 2 to 5 cm , 7 to 10 cm in places , are expected in the dé@@ parte@@ ments in question and 1 to 3 cm , indeed up to 5 cm in the Paris region .
The dé@@ parte@@ ments in question are Char@@ ente , Char@@ ent@@ e-@@ Maritime , Cot@@ es d &apos;@@ Arm@@ or , Fin@@ ist@@ ere , Gir@@ on@@ de , Dor@@ do@@ gne , Po@@ it@@ ou and those of the regions of Bas@@ se-@@ Nor@@ man@@ die , I@@ le-@@ de-@@ France and Lim@@ ou@@ sin .
According to Me@@ te@@ o France , snow ep@@ iso@@ des are sufficiently marked to create traffic problems and to dis@@ rupt certain economic activities .
In Cot@@ es d &apos;@@ Arm@@ or , access to vehicles of over 7 / 5 tonnes to several major roads is bar@@ red , including the Gu@@ ing@@ amp@@ -@@ L@@ ann@@ ion and the Saint-@@ Bri@@ eu@@ c-@@ Lou@@ de@@ ac roads .
Traff@@ ic on the B@@ ritt@@ any secondary network is very difficult and the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie recommends that vehicles should only be used where absolutely necessary . Traff@@ ic of certain T@@ ER vehic@@ es has been suspended for the day .
In Pic@@ ar@@ dy , all school transport on Thursday has been prohibited .
No special measures are con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated for Wednesday evening to restrict the traffic of heavy loads .
The pre@@ fec@@ ture asks all drivers to exercise the greatest possible care on roads and to adapt their driving accordingly .
The direc@@ tor@@ ate-@@ general of civil aviation ( D@@ G@@ AC ) has asked all air transport companies to cancel on Thursday 25 % of their flights to Ro@@ iss@@ y airport and 10 % to Or@@ ly airport , due to expected snow@@ fall .
The D@@ G@@ AC recommends air passengers to contact their carrier .
In Great Britain , Gat@@ wick airport in south London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland will be closed until Thursday morning .
Metro Grand Paris : First financial proposals ;
Since the time when the debate about the modernisation of transport in the I@@ le-@@ de-@@ France reached its highest point , thousands of millions of Euros have been ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ging .
In the discussion of means .
Men@@ tion is made in particular of the 23 thousand million Euros for the Grand Paris metro which the Grand Paris company is to build .
To start this S@@ GP , the State announced a contribution of 4 thous@@ ans million Euros .
In the theoretical scheme , it is this sum which will then enable the S@@ GP to bor@@ row in the market a part of the financing of its double loop .
To@@ day@@ . the first calculations have begun .
The 2010 law concerning recti@@ fication financing examined by the parliamentary finance commission this morning , contains the devices needed for finding the initial sum .
There are two of them : the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase of the tax on offices in the I@@ le-@@ de-@@ France .
The first , says article 15 of the draft law is &quot; for the establishment of the Grand Paris company . &quot;
El@@ le est chi@@ ff@@ r@@ ée : It says : The yield of this tax is 1@@ 17 million Euros annually .
The second is a rec@@ asting of a tax on offic@@ es@@ m which exists already &quot; in order to modern@@ ise , to increase its yield and to al@@ locate this increase to the Grand Paris company . &quot;
How much will this will bring in ?
M@@ yst@@ ery .
This does not figure in the text .
It falls far short of the 4 thousand million .
The ex@@ pose states that tax resources are additional to the 4 thousand million Euros of capital to be invested by the State and passed to the Grand Paris company as the project pro@@ gresses .
S@@ GP does not find this system sho@@ cking .
It is explained that from the moment the two sources of cash were created ( the two taxes , n@@ d@@ l@@ r ) it would be possible to cover the cost of three years of study and then resort to the 4 thousand million Euros .
&quot; This would be included in the budget and drawn on as the project develops &quot;
The S@@ GP estimates that the 4 thousand million Euros would be included in 2013 in the 2014 budget .
This device , in which the promised 4 thousand million Euros are already included , may give rise to a somewhat exc@@ ited parliamentary debate .
First public session on 7 December .
Ven@@ ge@@ ful h@@ ack@@ ers and sp@@ ies are waiting .
The Wiki@@ Le@@ aks affair has a double significance .
On the one hand , it is a scandal , which only looked scand@@ alous in the light of the hypo@@ cris@@ y which prev@@ ails in relations between States , citizens and the Press .
On the other hand , it announ@@ ces profound changes on international level and points to a future dominated by re@@ gression .
But let us take things in the right order .
The first aspect of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks is a confirmation of the fact that every secret service case ( of any country ) consists solely of Press c@@ utt@@ ings .
The &quot; extraordinary &quot; American re@@ vel@@ ations about the sexual hab@@ its of Berlusconi only report what it was possible to read for months in any daily ( except in those belonging to Berlusconi ) and the sin@@ ister car@@ ic@@ ature profile of K@@ ha@@ da@@ fi has long been a cab@@ are@@ t artists &apos;@@ sk@@ etch material .
The rule according to which secret files may only contain already known news is essential for secret services dynamic and not only in the present century .
If you visit a library devoted to American publications , you will see that every work repe@@ ats ( concerning the Gra@@ il , the myst@@ ery of Renn@@ es-@@ le-@@ Ch@@ ateau , the Tem@@ pl@@ ars , or the Ro@@ si@@ cru@@ cians ) exactly that which was already set out in earlier works .
And this is so not only because the author of occ@@ ul@@ t texts does not like to do previously un@@ published research ( and does not know where to look for news about what does not exist ) , but because those who devote them@@ ss@@ l@@ ves to occ@@ ul@@ tism , do not believe what they already know and which confirms what they had already learned .
This is D@@ an Brown &apos;s success mechanism .
The same applies to secret files .
The inform@@ ant is la@@ zy and la@@ zy ( or limited ) is also the head of secret service ( otherwise he could be , for all I know , an editor at Liber@@ ation ) , who does not consider to be true what he recognises .
Top secret information about Berlusconi , which the Amer@@ ei@@ can emb@@ assy in Rome sent to the State Department , was the same as that which News@@ week had published the week before .
So why did the re@@ vel@@ ations about these files make so much noise ?
On the one hand , they say that every cultiv@@ ated person already knows that emb@@ assi@@ es have , at least since the end of the Second World War and since heads of State could telephone one another or fly to meet for dinner , lost their diplomatic function and except for some little representation exercises , have become centres of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
Every spec@@ t@@ ator of investigation films knows this very well and it is hypo@@ critical to pre@@ tend that he does not .
Nevertheless , repe@@ ating it in public bre@@ aches the duty to be hypo@@ critical and only places American diplomacy in a bad light .
Secondly , the idea of a h@@ ack@@ er being able to acquire the deep@@ est secre@@ ts of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the pre@@ stige of the State Department .
The scandal affects both the victims and the &quot; exec@@ u@@ tion@@ ers &quot; equally .
But let us look at the prof@@ ou@@ d nature of what has happened .
For@@ mer@@ ly , in the days of Or@@ well , one could see all power as Big Bro@@ ther , who controlled every action of his subjects .
The Or@@ wel@@ lian pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y proved completely true , since being able to be completely controlled thanks to the telephone , the hotel visited , the motorway taken and so on , the citizen became a total victim of the eye of power .
But when one demonstrates what happens now , that even the secre@@ ts of power cann@@ at escape the control of a h@@ ack@@ er , the control report ce@@ ases to be uni@@ direc@@ tional and is able to circul@@ ate .
Power controls every citizen , but every citizen , or at least the h@@ ack@@ er as the citizen &apos;s av@@ enger , can learn all the secre@@ ts of power .
How can a power last , if it can no longer keep its secre@@ ts ?
It is true , as George Sim@@ mel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered ; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is a secret de@@ void of sec@@ rec@@ y , because it is in the public domain , but to dis@@ close , as Wiki@@ Le@@ aks has done , that the secre@@ ts of H@@ ill@@ ary Cli@@ ton were empty secre@@ ts , means taking away all her power .
Wiki@@ Le@@ aks did not inj@@ ure Sarkozy or Merkel , but did considerably inj@@ ure Clinton and Obama .
What will be the consequences of this injury inf@@ lic@@ ted on a very powerful entity ?
Clearly , in future , States will no longer be able to place on line secret information , which would be like posting it on a street corner .
But it is also clear that with current technologies it is us@@ eless to hope to be able to discuss confidential reports on the telephone .
Nothing is easier than to discover if and when a head of State has flo@@ wn away and to contact one of his / her colleagues .
How can private and confidential reports be discussed in the future ?
I know very well that for the moment my forecast is science fiction and fan@@ ci@@ ful , but I have to imagine government agents who travel discre@@ et@@ ly by routes which cannot be checked and that they have learned messages by heart , or have conce@@ aled written information in the he@@ el of a shoe .
The information will be on a single copy kept in a locked d@@ tra@@ wer ; basically , the attempted Wat@@ erg@@ ate es@@ pi@@ on@@ age was less succ@@ es@@ ul than Wiki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s. au f@@ ond , la tent@@ ative d &apos;@@ es@@ pi@@ onn@@ age du Wat@@ erg@@ ate a eu mo@@ ins de succ@@ ès que Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
I had occasion to write that technology goes forward like a cra@@ b , namely , back@@ wards .
A century after the in@@ vention of wireless tele@@ graphy revolution@@ ised communications , Internet re-@@ established wire tele@@ graphy ( telephone ) .
Video c@@ ass@@ ettes ( an@@ alogue ) had enabled cinema research workers to explore a film step@@ -@@ by-@@ step going back@@ ward and forward and discovering all the secre@@ ts of mon@@ tage , whilst digital CD &apos;s only allow j@@ umping from chapter to chapter , nam@@ s@@ ly by mac@@ rop@@ or@@ tions .
With high-speed trains one can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours , whilst going by air a total of three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours are needed .
Is it therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques rever@@ t to hor@@ se-@@ drawn carri@@ ages .
A last observation .
In other days the Press tried to understand what was happening in secret in emb@@ assi@@ es .
Now it is emb@@ assi@@ es which ask the Press for confi@@ d@@ ne@@ tial information .
Climate : How France tam@@ pers with its promises of finance .
A year after the Copenhagen agreement it is time to look at the ob@@ serv@@ ance of the promises of fast finance ( so-called fast start finance ) by developed countries .
And large-scale tam@@ per@@ ing cam to light .
According to the Copenhagen agre@@ em@@ s@@ nt , developed countries under@@ ook to furnis@@ h 30 thousand million dollars between 2010 and 2012 .
The European Union promised 7.@@ 2 thousand million Euros over three years and France 1.@@ 25 thousand million Euros ( 4@@ 20 million a year ) .
When CO@@ P@@ 16 opened , the European Union tried to persuade its partners of the authentic@@ ity of its commitment to rapid start finance , submitting a report deta@@ iling the actions of its member@@ -@@ States , Press c@@ n@@ fer@@ ences , major side events , the distribution of broch@@ ures ... rap@@ port dé@@ ta@@ ill@@ ant l &apos;@@ action de ses Et@@ ats m@@ emb@@ res , conf@@ ér@@ ence de pres@@ se , grand side event , distribution de broch@@ ures ...
The operation transparency is appreci@@ able and appreciated at its just value : developing countries and the civil society are doing the same and at the same level of preci@@ sion@@ . les pays en dé@@ vel@@ opp@@ ement et la soci@@ été civi@@ le aim@@ er@@ ai@@ ent que t@@ ous les pays dé@@ vel@@ opp@@ és f@@ ass@@ ent de m@@ ê@@ me avec un m@@ ê@@ me niveau de pré@@ ci@@ sion .
The European Union announ@@ ces having allocated in 2010 2.2 thousand million Euros , a good to@@ ken of ob@@ serv@@ ance of its promise of 7.@@ 2 thousand million Euros in 2012 .
But looking at details , things are more complicated .
This money must , according to the Copenhagen agre@@ en@@ ment , be &quot; new and additional &quot; to ensure that a supplementary effort is made without detriment to public development assistance .
Unfortunately , there is no agreement about what &quot; new and additional &quot; means .
Now that the European Commission has proposed a harmonisation , certain member@@ -@@ States including France have blocked the procedure .
Today , everyone choo@@ ses what suits him / it best .
The European Commission , for example , took for its reference the year 2009 ; international finance is maintained and it is adding 150 mili@@ ons over 3 years as fast start finan@@ ce@@ . les finan@@ cements internation@@ aux sont ma@@ inten@@ us , et elle y aj@@ ou@@ te 150 millions sur tro@@ is ans au ti@@ tre des finan@@ cements fast start .
Other countries chose similar references in terms of year , or of level of public development assistance .
On the contrary , France regards the financing of all 2010 new projects as &quot; new and additional projects . &quot;
In other words , there is no reference to the costs of the prec@@ eding years , or globally , of public development assistance .
Con@@ cre@@ tely , the total support given by France to developing countries can remain stable ( or even decrease ) , France maintains that it is ob@@ serving its commitment in re@@ sp@@ est of &quot; new and additional &quot; finance .
Another crucial element , the separation of gifts and loans .
There , again , there is no rule and everyone choo@@ ses his own method of calculation .
Some , like France , consider that a Euro l@@ ent is equal to a Euro don@@ ated .
Clearly , this is difficult to justify ; the effort is not cop@@ arab@@ le@@ . l &apos;@@ effort n &apos;@@ est pas comparable .
If the custom of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable ( often projects linked to emissions which rely on more efficient technologies ) it is fall@@ acious to call a Euro which one will rec@@ ou@@ p as a don@@ ated Euro .. In addi@@ it@@ on , only the cost of a loan to the lender country should be taken into acc@@ unt as its commitment ( equal to the rate of interest ) .
But France need only reason that it &quot; ob@@ serves &quot; it commitment of 4@@ 20 million Euros making 9@@ 1.5 % of loans ( 3@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 8 million Euros ) and 8.@@ 5 % of donations ( 3@@ 6.@@ 1 million Euros ) - see European Union document for your own veri@@ f@@ c@@ ation@@ . elle &quot; respec@@ te &quot; son engagement de 4@@ 20 millions d &apos;@@ euros en fa@@ is@@ ant 9@@ 1,5 % de pr@@ ê@@ ts ( 38@@ 9,@@ 8 millions d &apos;@@ euros ) et 8,@@ 5 % de d@@ ons ( 3@@ 6,@@ 1 millions d &apos;@@ euros ) - voir le document de l &apos;@@ U@@ E pour v@@ éri@@ fier par v@@ ous@@ -@@ m@@ ê@@ me .
It is the only country of the Union to use loans on such a massive scale .
Germany is lending 46 % , whilst Denmark , The Netherlands and Slovakia ( among others ) observe their ci@@ omm@@ itment with 100 % as donations .
In other words , when the great majority of the European Union gives 1 Euro to meet its commitment , France only gives 10 cen@@ times and regards its effort as comparable .
A nice s@@ lei@@ ght of hand !
Sum@@ ming up , France operates , in its fast start finance , double black@@ mail : on the one hand , on the evolution of the action over time and the other hand , on the reality of the financial eff@@ or@@ t@@ . d &apos;@@ une part sur l &apos;@@ é@@ volution de l &apos;@@ action dans le temp@@ s et d &apos;@@ au@@ tre part sur la ré@@ ali@@ té de l &apos;@@ effort finan@@ ci@@ er .
By only spending 3@@ 6.@@ 1 million Euros it thinks that it is generating a belief to be spending 4@@ 20 million &quot; new and additional &quot; Euros as it promised .
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance ( because it appears that it is Ber@@ cy that implemented the arbit@@ rage ) could have a doub@@ ly negative impact , both within the European Union ( why should the other member@@ -@@ States continue to give , if lending is sufficient ? ) and in the negotiations , since the developing countries are not completely du@@ ped ....
The early finance chapter is only a small , relatively short-term matter in relation to all the discussions about the climate .
But it could be p@@ one more grain of sand in the huge machine , the UN@@ F@@ C@@ CC .
Let us hope that this is not the case .
In any event , it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early finance .
First of all , France could announce a change in its method of accoun@@ tan@@ cy for 2011 and 2012 in a spirit of hon@@ ouring its commitments and of equity with other European Union countries .
But above all , France could promote the discussions about long-term financing st@@ akes ( another crucial chapter currently being discussed ) ; it is not possible to avoid the question of &quot; addi@@ tionality &quot; or of the method of accoun@@ tan@@ cy of lo@@ ans@@ . on n &apos;@@ é@@ chap@@ per@@ a pas à la question de &quot; l &apos;@@ addi@@ tion@@ ali@@ té &quot; ou du mode de comp@@ t@@ abili@@ sation des pr@@ ê@@ ts .
France could change its position to become as pro@@ gre@@ si@@ s@@ ve on these st@@ akes as it it on others .
The hope therefore re@@ sts on the new Minister of the Environment , M@@ me Ko@@ sci@@ us@@ ko@@ -@@ M@@ oriz@@ et who will arrive in Cas@@ un next week .
A surprise announcement on France &apos;s fast start and on the view of &quot; addi@@ tionality &quot; and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed for progress in these discussions .
Al@@ ert on pesticides consum@@ ed by children .
According to a study published o Wednesday by the Future Gener@@ ations association ( form@@ el@@ ry Mo@@ vement for the Rights and Res@@ p@@ ect of Future Gener@@ ations ) , a child of 10 consum@@ es in one day 81 different chemical substances .
The association which predic@@ ts that its results do not possess , in view of the small number of samples analy@@ sed , any significant statistical value , but illustr@@ ate the problem being dealt with , has bought in sper@@ markets of the O@@ ise and of Paris between July and September , the bas@@ ket of foodstuffs generally consum@@ ed in four meals by a child of ten .
These meals inc@@ l@@ du@@ ing official recommendations , five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables , three dairy products and 1.5 lit@@ res of water as well as delic@@ acies , were examined by clinical research labor@@ atories dealing with chemicals , pesticides , heavy metals and other poll@@ ut@@ ants .
The balance sheet is stag@@ gering : 81 chemical substances including 42 classified as potentially or probably car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and five classified as definitely car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic , as well as 37 substances able to indu@@ ce endo@@ cr@@ ine dis@@ orders , according to studies by several institutions such as the International Canc@@ er Research Centre .
According to the Associ@@ a@@ it@@ on , even if , in almost all cases , the legal limits of each chemical substance are not exceeded , our inquiry shows that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic contam@@ in@@ ant is worrying .
For breakfast , but@@ ter and tea with milk alone contain over ten possible and three proven car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic resi@@ du@@ es and almost twenty resi@@ du@@ es potentially able to distur@@ b the hor@@ m@@ one system .
An app@@ le from Brazil contains traces of six chemical substances inclu@@ ing a fun@@ gi@@ cide , prohibited in France .
The same applies to be@@ ans from Kenya included in a lun@@ che@@ on , in which the study found traces of a powerful in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide prohibited in the European Union .
In addi@@ it@@ on , min@@ ced ste@@ ak , cann@@ ed tuna and even a bag@@ u@@ ette and che@@ wing g@@ um contained pesticides and other chemicals .
Tap@@ water contained nit@@ rates and ch@@ lor@@ o@@ form .
For dinner , sal@@ mon ste@@ ak was the &quot; rich@@ est , &quot; with 34 chemical resi@@ du@@ es and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal in a micro@@ wave , was not exemp@@ t .
According to the study , the final risk for the consumer in this &quot; contam@@ in@@ ant cocktail &quot; is probably under@@ estimated .
For its part , the European Ec@@ ology Alliance - the Greens proposed , in view of the urgency of the situation , the introduction of a moratorium on the use of pesticides , in order to stop the growth of civilisation &apos;s diseases .
In July , a study by the European Food Safety Agency pointed to the presence of resi@@ du@@ es of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consum@@ ed in Europe including 76 in cere@@ als .
Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo , Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize , the fourth American president in history to do so .
He will receive a diplom@@ a , me@@ dal and che@@ que for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation , amongst other things .
The head of the White House will be flying into the Norwe@@ gian city in the morning with his wife Mich@@ elle and will have a busy schedule .
First , he will visit the Nobel Institute , where he will have his first meeting with the five committee members who selected him from 17@@ 2 people and 33 organisations .
The presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with King Har@@ ald V and Queen Son@@ ja of Norway .
Then , in the afternoon , the visit will cul@@ min@@ ate in a grand ceremony , at which Obama will receive the prestigious award .
He will be the fourth American president to be awarded the prize , and only the third to have received it while actually in office .
The White House has stated that , when he accepts the prize , Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan .
The president does not want to sk@@ ir@@ t around this topic , as he reali@@ ses that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries .
A few days ago he step@@ ped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan , something that his critics will be stres@@ sing .
At the ceremony , Obama will also be given a gold me@@ dal , a diplom@@ a , and a che@@ que for ten million Swedish k@@ ron@@ a ( around 24 million Czech cro@@ wns ) .
He intends to don@@ ate this money to char@@ ity , but has@@ n &apos;t decided which yet .
Their busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a ban@@ quet , which will be attended by the Norwe@@ gian king and qu@@ een as well as the ministeri@@ al chairman and another 250 invited guests .
Obama has always been re@@ tic@@ ent in regards to his prize .
He has said , for example , that he feels that he does not wholly deserve it .
He has repeatedly said that the prize isn &apos;t for him , but for everyone who up@@ holds the same values .
Right after hearing about it , he described it as a &quot; challenge to take action . &quot;
Nature protection officers accused of black@@ mail
The Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice police have accused the chairman of the Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice Nature Protection Society civil association of black@@ mail .

The chairman of the Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice Nature Protection Society is L@@ ub@@ om@@ í@@ r Stu@@ d@@ ni@@ č@@ ka .
He is now under arrest and faces up to three years in prison .
Recy@@ cling containers don &apos;t smell so good in Br@@ no
In Prague , normal people can sort their be@@ verage bot@@ tles , and , in South Mor@@ avian , villages are recycling containers on every corner .
And in Br@@ no ?
There , it will take you a good few minutes to find the right sort of bin .
I don &apos;t mean to imp@@ ly that gar@@ b@@ age isn &apos;t sor@@ ted in Br@@ no .
But it seems to me that considering we &apos;re the second largest city in the country , the authorities are not showing enough interest in this problem .
Br@@ no is falling way behind in its gar@@ b@@ age sor@@ ting , not only because people here can still only put paper , glass and plastic into these b@@ ins , but mostly because of the she@@ er lack of containers for this kind of waste .
Have you ever tried thro@@ wing a plastic bottle into a bin in the city centre ?
It &apos;s a real art form , and you need time and steady ner@@ ves .
The only place we &apos;ve managed to come across is on Mor@@ av@@ sk@@ é n@@ á@@ m@@ ě@@ st@@ í , opposite the Pot@@ ref@@ en@@ á Hus@@ a .
No off@@ ence to Mr. On@@ der@@ ka and his colleagues , but it &apos;s really not good enough .
Not to mention that it &apos;s no easy task sor@@ ting gar@@ b@@ age in other parts of the city .
Pl@@ enty of my friends don &apos;t bo@@ ther sor@@ ting their gar@@ b@@ age .
Out of la@@ zin@@ ess .
It &apos;s just too far to the bin , you see .
I don &apos;t blame them .
After a party , I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bot@@ tles .
But , on Ko@@ uni@@ co@@ va uli@@ ce , there were no coloured b@@ ins to be seen .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily , on the way to the tram , I found the right place .
But it was over@@ f@@ lowing with gar@@ b@@ age .
Come on , this is the centre of Br@@ no . Is@@ n &apos;t it supposed to look good ?
It should , but ec@@ ology and aes@@ the@@ tics don &apos;t seem to interest the Br@@ no soci@@ alists much .
They prefer to buy the city a new ho@@ ckey extra@@ -@@ le@@ ague , which puts us to shame all over the country , instead of buying a few more containers and letting us sort other gar@@ b@@ age for a clean@@ er Br@@ no .
I &apos;m glad to see that , after brow@@ sing the net for a while , my assu@@ mp@@ tions are confirmed by official statistics .
Fig@@ ures published by EK@@ O-@@ KOM show that Br@@ no really is the worst off in the whole of South Mor@@ a@@ via .
&quot; Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k &apos;s &quot; budget takes money for pensions and sick pay
The fact that the left gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions , sick pay , or building society savings .
And also not enough for interest on the national debt or to cover international judicial disputes .
This will bring problems for wh@@ o@@ ever is in office in the latter half of next year , said the Finance Minister E@@ du@@ ard Jan@@ ota .
When the social demo@@ crats and commun@@ ists raised interest rates for certain groups , they were rel@@ ying on the fact that the government would loan money for sus@@ cep@@ tible expenses , pensions , and sick pay . &quot; It &apos;s just a case of post@@ pon@@ ing the problem , laying a min@@ e@@ field , &quot; says Jan@@ ota .
High@@ er interest has to be paid on lo@@ an@@ ed money , and , at some point , it has to be paid back .
The state does not have much choice where to find it .
If it doesn &apos;t reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state , it will have to increase taxes .
For all those that the left just handed out money to : fire@@ figh@@ ters , teachers , farmers .
And later , their children , too .
People don &apos;t have to worry about pensions or sick pay , where 1.@@ 8 billion has disappeared from the accounts ; they &apos;ll get them .
Although , at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt – next year the treas@@ ury won &apos;t just be 16@@ 3 billion short , but even more .
Despite the efforts of Minister Jan@@ ota , debt will continue to increase at an ever faster rate , as will interest costs .
The state will need money to cover it , and it &apos;s no longer enough just to slightly b@@ ump up V@@ AT@@ s or reduce mat@@ ernity benefits , as the government has done in its anti-@@ deficit package .
As money has been diver@@ ted to several groups of voters , next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building high@@ ways and railways .
These are mostly sections that have been ten@@ dered out and are half-@@ finished and cannot be re@@ designed or made any cheaper .
At the most , con@@ serve what isn &apos;t free too .
This means that dela@@ ying or hal@@ ting thirty major building projects and money from European funds is also at risk , war@@ ns transport mini@@ stry spo@@ kes@@ man Karel Han@@ zel@@ ka .
The Č@@ SS@@ D has suggested that the deficit be resolved Sol@@ om@@ on-@@ style – it should draw on Č@@ E@@ Z divi@@ den@@ ds , which are mostly state-@@ owned , and use those to top up the transport fund .
The problem is that the level of these divi@@ den@@ ds is never certain , and they are certainly not a bot@@ tom@@ less resource .
Last year , 18 billion of Č@@ E@@ Z money went into the budget .
Every year , these divi@@ den@@ ds are used to pay for cle@@ aring up ecological damage , t@@ opping up the pensions account , or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms .
Moreover , according to EU regulations , this tri@@ ck increases the actual budget deficit to 5.@@ 7 percent of GDP .
But this is not the end of these transfers .
The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages o@@ wed to the victims of commun@@ ism and crime , to meet the cost of judicial disputes , and even to cover building society savings .
It is still not clear if the state can get by without this money .
It &apos;s a gam@@ ble .
If we were to lose an international dispute , we &apos;d still have to pay , claims Jan@@ ota .
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or , in the worst case scenario , reach into the government &apos;s budget reserve .
The two-@@ billi@@ on-@@ cro@@ wn State Treas@@ ury project , which is already under@@ way , is also lacking a hundred million , and what each office is spending can be followed on-line .
The first stage will start in January .
If the finance minister can &apos;t find the money elsewhere , the project will have to be abor@@ ted and sanctions will be imposed , war@@ ns Jan@@ ota .
Your next sm@@ art@@ phone will run two operating systems
The Americans are saying that , in the future , users will be able to switch between different operating systems on their mobile phones at the touch of a button .
The plans revealed so far look promising .
Just press one key and in just a few seconds you can switch from Windows Mobile to Andro@@ id .
This is the goal of the American company V@@ mware , which primarily develops computer virtu@@ alisation software .
This will let you have two user profiles at once on the same phone .
You can switch between them or have one for work and one for home .
Both of them will run at the same time , says S@@ r@@ ini@@ vas Kris@@ h@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti of V@@ M@@ ware in an interview with Computer World magazine .
It was presented last November and first demonstrated just a few days ago .
It will go on sale in 2012 .
The virtu@@ alisation of sm@@ art@@ phones is not science fiction .
V@@ M@@ ware has already given re@@ por@@ ters a demonstration of a sm@@ art@@ phone with two operating systems .
It was a modified N@@ 800 with 128 MB of RAM , running Windows Mobile and Andro@@ id at the same time .
The development of new mobile phone technology is in full s@@ wing .
V@@ M@@ ware is now working with European and American operators to test sm@@ art@@ phone virtu@@ alisation and the sets should reach customers some@@ time during 2012 .
L@@ ack of snow in mountains causes problems for ho@@ te@@ liers
It &apos;s not only Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e ski@@ -@@ lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes .
The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses .
This means vac@@ ancies are still available in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e throughout the winter , including Christmas and New Year &apos;s E@@ ve .
We &apos;re getting plenty of visitors to our site .
People are brow@@ sing the offers , checking prices , but , so far , are worried about making a definite booking .
&quot; When they call , the first thing they ask is if we think they &apos;ll see snow or mu@@ d , &quot; says Martin J@@ and@@ ura , who runs the Sp@@ ind@@ l@@ .@@ Info information web site .
Anyone who wants to spend New Year &apos;s E@@ ve in Š@@ pin@@ d@@ ler@@ ů@@ v M@@ l@@ ý@@ n just how they want , had better start thinking about booking soon .
Those prefer@@ ring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days .
Ho@@ te@@ liers in Š@@ pin@@ d@@ ler@@ ů@@ v M@@ l@@ ý@@ n are so far just offering week@@ -@@ long stays for New Year &apos;s E@@ ve .
I think they &apos;ll try to keep that up for a while , but even they will give in and offer shorter stays .
Then there &apos;ll be a sudden shortage of vac@@ ancies , &quot; estimates J@@ and@@ ura .
The V@@ r@@ ch@@ lab@@ í travel agency In@@ gt@@ ours is still offering vac@@ ancies throughout the winter .
What we ’ re interested in is Christmas week , which has@@ n &apos;t sold out yet .
Hal@@ f of our capacity is still available .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve been preparing some cheaper la@@ st-@@ minute Christmas breaks , &quot; said In@@ gt@@ ours director Pet@@ r Schie@@ fert .
The V@@ r@@ ch@@ lab@@ í travel agency can still offer New Year &apos;s E@@ ve in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e , but there are fewer vac@@ ancies .
Another good time for bookings is the first for@@ tn@@ i@@ ght in February , although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average .
This year , interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e .
People are waiting to see if any falls .
N@@ obo@@ dy wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there &apos;s no snow .
If snow falls on the slopes this week , Christmas will sell out too , &quot; says Schie@@ fert .
On the other hand , the Horiz@@ ont Hotel in Pe@@ c po@@ d Sn@@ ě@@ ž@@ k@@ ou has seen better bookings this year than last year .
We &apos;re up about 5 percent .
We have the last few vac@@ ancies for New Year &apos;s E@@ ve and Christmas .
There &apos;s a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too , &quot; explains the director of the best hotel in Pe@@ c , Karel R@@ ada .
The Om@@ nia Hotel , by the central car park in Jan@@ sk@@ é L@@ á@@ zn@@ ě , is ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ percent booked up for New Year &apos;s E@@ ve .
Yet the newest hotel in Jan@@ sk@@ é L@@ á@@ zn@@ ě still has half its beds free for Christmas .
January this year has been a nice surprise , as we &apos;re already six@@ ty-@@ percent booked up .
So February isn &apos;t looking quite so good , but as soon as it sno@@ ws , then interest in staying in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e will definitely rise , says the owner of the Om@@ nia Hotel , Eri@@ k Spor@@ y@@ sch .
For now , however , the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e ho@@ te@@ liers will have to wait for heavi@@ er falls of snow .
Col@@ der weather is forecast for Thursday , so if anything falls , it should be snow .
But it should get war@@ mer again after that , said Ji@@ ř@@ í Jak@@ ub@@ sk@@ ý of the Czech Hydro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ological Institute in H@@ ra@@ dec .
USA : Re@@ petition is the mother of wisdom
It &apos;s almost fun@@ ny to see how Barack Obama , re@@ pu@@ tedly the wis@@ est president , is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor , having himself considered him to be the most foo@@ lish .
When he finally came out with his long-@@ awa@@ ited Afghan doctr@@ ine , it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush &apos;s Iraq scenario three years earlier .
It &apos;s not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words &quot; just like in Iraq &quot; , but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush &apos;s declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration : &quot; The new way forward &quot; .
While three years ago he himself criticised Bush &apos;s idea to send fresh troops to help in the bele@@ agu@@ ered civil war in Iraq as &quot; an irresponsible decision with catastrop@@ hi@@ c consequences &quot; .
The following months , however , showed that Bush &apos;s strategy , which was recommended by his field comm@@ anders , was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq .
It didn &apos;t help Bush &apos;s reputation , but in objective terms , it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected .
Barack Obama hopes that , in Afghanistan , the mi@@ racle will repeat itself .
He was again asked to increase the military cont@@ ingent by his field comm@@ anders , particularly the su@@ preme comm@@ ander of the Afghan operation General Stan@@ ley Mc@@ Chr@@ yst@@ al , who even went against the custom of his sub@@ ordin@@ ates to har@@ sh@@ ly critic@@ ise the reluc@@ tant gun@@ ners in the White House .
He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around .
The president hesit@@ ated for three months , but failed to come up with anything better , and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers .
He managed to squ@@ ee@@ ze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand , even though he himself was originally counting on 10 .
The tri@@ ck@@ i@@ est aspect of Obama &apos;s strategy seems to be his plan to start pul@@ ling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years . Obama &apos;s doctr@@ ine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers .
Many doubt that this half-@@ hear@@ ted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq .
Despite the intern@@ ec@@ ine war of recent years , Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been hon@@ ouring the treaties .
The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be re@@ lied upon and no treaties are being up@@ held .
In these conditions , it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare , being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves .
Political institutions , no matter how formally they might be set up , will be nothing more than a Po@@ tem@@ kin village in which patri@@ arch@@ al tri@@ bal relations will run wild .
Bal@@ an@@ cing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is un@@ usually difficult due to the tri@@ cky relations between them , a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran .
Even building an &quot; operational state &quot; , which is the most basic aim of the entire operation , does not seem particularly feasible .
The timing of Obama &apos;s strategy is fo@@ iled by his volun@@ tar@@ ism .
Over the last eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse , and is now on the ver@@ ge of explo@@ ding .
Only a truly romantic soul , totally un@@ affected by reality , could believe that the soldiers sent into the tur@@ mo@@ il of this war for an &quot; early return home &quot; will bring about any mi@@ ra@@ cles here .
From a political view@@ po@@ in , t it is pure ir@@ responsibility setting a date for with@@ drawing the troops , as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowled@@ gement of an American defeat .
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is wan@@ ing .
European politicians cannot and are un@@ willing to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foo@@ th@@ ills of the Hin@@ du K@@ ush .
Another factor which could radi@@ cally sti@@ r things up is what is going on around Iran .
If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect , the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not .
This will need answer@@ ing when , according to Obama , America orders the vic@@ t@@ orious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan .
Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turn@@ around in the Afghan situation .
The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections , so there &apos;s still enough time for him to come up with another strateg@@ y@@ if this one turns out to be a total wh@@ it@@ e@@ w@@ ash .
Man@@ agers at Gold@@ man Sach@@ s no longer to receive cash bon@@ uses
The top management of the American bank Gold@@ man Sach@@ s will not receive their bon@@ uses in cash this year .
The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their sal@@ ary policies .
Instead of money , the group of 30 top managers will receive shares , which cannot be sold for another five years .
The shares can also be conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated if the managers take excessive risks .
According to Re@@ uters , Gold@@ man Sach@@ s is leading the effort to link Wall Street bon@@ uses with long-term performance .
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take , said former investment ban@@ ker for JP@@ Morgan , Dou@@ glas El@@ li@@ ott .
The problem lies in the details , he added .
Gold@@ man Sach@@ sh@@ as been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars ( almost 300 billion cro@@ wns ) for bon@@ uses in the first three quarters of this year .
Re@@ uters claims that the total bon@@ uses awarded by the business this year , despite today &apos;s announcement , excee@@ ds 20 billion dollars .
High bon@@ uses in the banking sector , what with the economic crisis , have become a political hot pot@@ ato .
On Wednesday , Britain announced that it had decided to charge a one-@@ off fif@@ ty percent tax rate on ban@@ kers &apos; bon@@ uses excee@@ ding 25@@ ,000 po@@ unds ( around 7@@ 12@@ ,000 C@@ Z@@ K ) .
France is preparing similar measures .
This year , women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physi@@ cs
In Stockholm today , a record five women received Nobel Pri@@ zes from the Swedish king Carl X@@ VI Gu@@ sta@@ f in the professional categories and for literature .
In addition to four scientists , they also included the German writer Her@@ ta Müller , originally from Romania .
The Nobel Prize for medicine went to two American bi@@ ologists , Eli@@ za@@ beth Black@@ burn and Car@@ ol G@@ rei@@ der , together with their fellow country@@ man Jack S@@ zo@@ sta@@ k , for their research in chro@@ mo@@ som@@ es .
The prize for chem@@ istry was won by the Israeli A@@ da Jon@@ ath , together with the Americans Ven@@ kat@@ ra@@ man Ram@@ ak@@ ris@@ hn@@ an and Thomas Stei@@ tz , for their work to clarify the structure and function of ri@@ bo@@ som@@ es .
The last award was the Nobel Prize for Econom@@ ics , which went to the Americans E@@ lin@@ or Ost@@ rom and Oliver Willi@@ am@@ son for their analysis of economic management .
The only specialised category which nobody won this year was physi@@ cs .
Today , this prize was won by the scientists Charles Ka@@ o , for his research in optical fi@@ b@@ res , and George Smith and Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle , for inv@@ enting the C@@ CD ship , which is the basis for all digital cameras , fa@@ xes , and astronom@@ ical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
All the winners received a diplom@@ a , the Nobel Me@@ dal , and a certificate for a monetary reward .
In each category , this award tot@@ als ten million Swedish k@@ ron@@ a ( approximately 25 million C@@ Z@@ K ) .
If there are multiple winners , they share the prize money between them .
Tradi@@ tionally , the most high@@ ly-@@ anticipated award , the Nobel Peace Prize , went to the American president Barack Obama in the Norwe@@ gian city of Oslo this afternoon .
In his speech , he acknowledged that the award was controversial , as he is just starting out in office and , moreover , heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan .
In defence of his policy he added , however , that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace , despite the high cost .
Minister Jan@@ ota considers re@@ sign@@ ation . Klaus invites him to the Castle
On Friday morning , President V@@ á@@ cla@@ v Klaus will meet with the finance minister E@@ du@@ ard Jan@@ ota , who is considering re@@ signing as he does not agree with the government &apos;s budget for next year as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
It is assumed that the budget and also Jan@@ ota &apos;s possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday &apos;s meeting .
The budget has also been criticised by Klaus .
He claims the deficit is too high , which is wor@@ sen@@ ing the public funding crisis .
The meeting was announced by the president &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man Radi@@ m O@@ ch@@ v@@ at .
Jan@@ ota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister , Jan Fischer .
According to the Budget Act , which Klaus is due to sign , the Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 16@@ 3 billion cro@@ wns .
However , on Wednesday , the House approved the left &apos;s proposals to transfer funds , gave state employees a pay rise , and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers .
The government criticised the social demo@@ crats &apos; proposals , saying that they will sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously increase the budget deficit .
A bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand , and the government , Klaus , and the right on the other , leading to questions about the future of Fischer &apos;s interim government , which was agreed on in spring by the O@@ DS , Č@@ SS@@ D and Green Party .
Cri@@ tics claim that the budget , as approved by the House , essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by Fischer &apos;s government in autumn and which it believes should stop the state falling deeper into debt .
At a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today , Klaus , who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it , declared that politicians have long been neg@@ lec@@ ting a &quot; serious problem , &quot; which is the &quot; un@@ sustainable deficit level &quot; of public finances .
Now , he claims , there is no good solution to this .
The only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties , the president says .
O@@ DS chairman Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should re@@ think continuing in office .
The vic@@ e-@@ chairman of the O@@ DS , Pet@@ r Ne@@ č@@ as , told Č@@ T@@ K that the concept of an interim government supported by the Č@@ SS@@ D , O@@ DS , and the Green Party is evi@@ dently no longer working .
In response to this , Premier Fischer described this statement as &quot; strong words . &quot;
The head of the Č@@ SS@@ D , Ji@@ ř@@ í Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k , re@@ acted to Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget prepared by the former Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k government for this year , which excee@@ ds 200 billion cro@@ wns .
On Wednesday the Č@@ SS@@ D declared the approval of next year &apos;s budget to be a success .
The People &apos;s Party was also satisfied .
Mand@@ ela played by Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an in Clin@@ t E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s new film
South Afri@@ cans claim that the new Hollywood film In@@ vic@@ tus will tell the world a lot about their country , its struggle and its vic@@ tories , despite some people critic@@ ising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors .
It is a story about sport , race relations , and N@@ elson Mand@@ ela .
The life of the ti@@ reless figh@@ ter against the rac@@ ist system of apar@@ thei@@ d in South Africa and its first black president , N@@ elson Mand@@ ela , is played by the O@@ scar@@ -@@ winning American actor Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an .
Fre@@ em@@ an said that he had asked n@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ one-@@ year-old Mand@@ ela if he could play him in E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s film .
Another leading role in the film is played by Mat@@ t Dam@@ on .
I told him : &apos; If I &apos;m going to play you , I &apos;ll need access to you &quot; .
The sevent@@ y-@@ two-@@ year-old actor , who won an O@@ scar for his role in E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s bo@@ xing drama Million Dollar Baby , has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-@@ sla@@ very movement who eventually himself became a slave , a fic@@ ti@@ tious president of the USA , and even a go@@ d in E@@ van Al@@ mi@@ ghty , but has only rarely portra@@ yed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mand@@ ela .
The former South African stat@@ es@@ man spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apar@@ thei@@ d in South Africa .
He was released in 1990 and was then the country &apos;s president for four years .
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
In@@ vic@@ tus is Latin for &apos; un@@ con@@ qu@@ ered &apos; and is the name of a po@@ em by the English writer William Ern@@ est Hen@@ ley , published in 18@@ 75 .
The challenge was to speak like he does .
The film tells the true story of how N@@ elson Mand@@ ela joined forces with the cap@@ tain of the South African ru@@ g@@ by team , Fran@@ co@@ is Pi@@ en@@ a@@ ar , to help uni@@ fy the country . The new@@ ly-@@ elected President Mand@@ ela knows that , after apar@@ thei@@ d , his nation will still be ra@@ cially and economically divided .
He believes that he can unite people through sport , so he decides to unite the ru@@ g@@ by players who , to the world , are out@@ si@@ ders .
The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995 .
Fre@@ em@@ an worked for several years to get Mand@@ ela &apos;s story onto the big screen .
My only aim was to play this role as reali@@ stically as possible , said Fre@@ em@@ an .
Naturally , the greatest challenge was to speak like Mand@@ ela .
The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park , he would try to meet Mand@@ ela , go for dinner with him , and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches .
The most important thing was that he wanted to sha@@ ke Mand@@ ela &apos;s hand .
I found out that when I take your hand , I draw on your energy , it flows into me , and I feel that I know how you are feeling , he said .
For me it &apos;s important to try and become a different person .
In the film , Mat@@ t Dam@@ on portra@@ ys Franç@@ ois Pi@@ en@@ a@@ ar , the cap@@ tain of the national ru@@ g@@ by team , which was dominated by white players .
The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of ru@@ g@@ by to prepare for the role .
It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pi@@ en@@ a@@ ar at his home .
I remember ring@@ ing his door@@ bell , he opened it , and the very first thing I said to Franç@@ ois Pi@@ en@@ a@@ ar was : &apos; I look much bigger on the screen . &apos; 
Despite the evident differences in the stat@@ ure of the actors compared to their real-@@ life counter@@ parts , under E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s direction , In@@ vic@@ tus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an O@@ scar nom@@ ination .
The Da@@ ily Vari@@ ety film cri@@ tic To@@ d@@ d McCar@@ thy sum@@ med up the film by saying : &quot; It was a great story , a very well-@@ made film . &quot;
In the film reviews on ro@@ tt@@ ent@@ om@@ ato@@ es@@ .com , In@@ vic@@ tus has a 76 percent positive rating .
Secre@@ t of the gl@@ are over Norway solved : the Russians were testing a ro@@ cket
St@@ range lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway .
Yesterday the Russian defence mini@@ stry finally admitted that it had tested an inter@@ continental bal@@ li@@ stic missi@@ le not far from the Norwe@@ gian border .
However , it was another un@@ successful launch and the missi@@ le , which is known as &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; and should have been the pride and gl@@ ory of the Russian army , has gradually turned into a night@@ mare for the Russian gener@@ als and Prime Minister , V@@ ladimir Putin .
His repeated presence at tests on the ro@@ cket has not affected the success rate of the test flights .
The Bul@@ ava has generally not li@@ fted off or has been damaged in the air .
The Russian newspapers are descri@@ bing the &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; as &quot; the fli@@ ght@@ less ro@@ cket . &quot;
The ro@@ cket that doesn &apos;t fly but lights up
This , the 13th test , started off according to plan .
But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missi@@ le .
Appar@@ ently the engine ble@@ w up in the ro@@ cket &apos;s third phase .
This time , the &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; was launched from the atom@@ ic sub@@ marine D@@ mit@@ ri@@ j Don@@ ski@@ j , which was cru@@ ising under the surface of the White Sea .
This type of ro@@ cket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even sub@@ mer@@ ged .
This makes it likely that the mysteri@@ ous light over Norway , caused by an uni@@ denti@@ fied flying object , was actually the mal@@ functioning &quot; Bul@@ ava . &quot;
Any@@ way , the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans never had any doubts that it was a Russian ro@@ cket .
The gener@@ als are defending themselves this time though , claiming that it can &apos;t be described as a total failure .
The first two phases of the ro@@ cket went well , and the accident happened during the third stage .
Pre@@ viously , the engines have always mal@@ func@@ tioned during the first phase .
Even though not one test launch has been completely er@@ ror@@ -@@ free , the defence mini@@ stry consider only six out of the thir@@ teen tests to have been failures .
The gener@@ als are optimistic about this almost fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ percent success rate and keep insi@@ sting that the &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hy@@ person@@ ic nuclear blocks weigh@@ ing a total of 1.@@ 15 tons .
The legendary Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v signs a year &apos;s contract with CS@@ K@@ A Moscow aged 51
The legendary def@@ ender V@@ ja@@ č@@ es@@ la@@ v Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v will again play a professional ic@@ e-@@ ho@@ ckey match at the age of 51 .
The former world champion , Olympic winner and Stan@@ ley Cup holder will help out his team , CS@@ K@@ A Moscow , when they need him , and will evi@@ dently be playing in the fifth K@@ H@@ L du@@ el against Saint Petersburg .
Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v , who reti@@ red at for@@ ty in 1998 , is currently the president of CS@@ K@@ A .
Since Den@@ is Kul@@ ja@@ š was injured , we urgently need another def@@ ender .
Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v is training regularly and has agreed to help the team .
We just need to sort out a few formali@@ ties , the AP agency quoted the Moscow club coach Ser@@ ge@@ j N@@ ě@@ m@@ č@@ ino@@ v as saying .
It &apos;s not year clear whether or not the famous ho@@ ckey player &apos;s com@@ eb@@ ack will be for just one match .
I think Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v is someone who can boost the mor@@ ale of the other players , said N@@ ě@@ m@@ č@@ ino@@ v .
According to AP , if Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v returns to the ice , he will be the oldest Russian professional ho@@ ckey player .

Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i obli@@ ges unions . All over@@ time is cut
The management of the Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i car plant in No@@ š@@ o@@ vice has agreed with the unions to cut all over@@ time .
It is because of all this forced over@@ time that the unions have declared a strike on Monday .
This was confirmed by the Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i spo@@ kes@@ man , Pet@@ r Van@@ ě@@ k .
The management , however , wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year .
We can &apos;t give up on our production plan , it &apos;s essential , so we have proposed voluntary over@@ time on Saturday December 19th , involving two shi@@ fts , said Van@@ ě@@ k .
The website S@@ ed@@ mi@@ č@@ ka@@ .@@ cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 C@@ Z@@ K .
This bonus will also be paid retro@@ spec@@ tively to those who worked on Saturday November 28@@ th .
According to Van@@ ě@@ k , the firm has decided to change how it motiv@@ ates its employees to take the proposed over@@ time .
Ei@@ ther they &apos;ll claim the additional wage for the over@@ time or they can take time off in lieu on December 28@@ th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day , said Van@@ ě@@ k .
Additionally , all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for .
Consi@@ dering that over@@ time was the most pressing and thor@@ ny question for the unions , as well as for the prote@@ sting employees who brought production to such a gr@@ in@@ ding halt last week , the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all over@@ time for December , said Van@@ ě@@ k .
Until last week , virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours &apos; over@@ time on top of their normal eigh@@ t-@@ hour shi@@ fts .
After signing the agreement , the trade unions will call off the strike
Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning .
On Wednesday , the head of the unions , Pet@@ r Ku@@ cha@@ ř , said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document , they are willing to call off the strike .
The situation at the plant deterior@@ ated shar@@ ply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spon@@ tane@@ ous strike to protest against the inc@@ ess@@ ant over@@ time .
They were also prote@@ sting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution .
The management responded by saying that employees had to work over@@ time to meet the demand for cars .
In Monday &apos;s announcement of the strike , the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who hal@@ ted production last Wednesday .
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep over@@ time to a minimum .
Moreover , this year they are requesting that a 5000 cro@@ wn bonus be paid for this work .
The Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i car plant in No@@ š@@ o@@ vice now emplo@@ ys 2000 people .
The firm began series production last November .
By this September , it had made around 80@@ ,000 cars , and its current capacity is 200@@ ,000 vehicles a year .
Czech discovery : a substance which works on &apos; tough &apos; forms of the HIV virus
A team of Czech and German scientists has been testing a new compo@@ und which can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body .
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medic@@ ation .
In some cases , this out@@ weigh@@ s the fact that the compo@@ und used for the normal form of the virus does not have such a strong effect as some drugs that are already available .
No cure has yet been found for AIDS .
Pati@@ ents &apos; lives can be greatly prolon@@ ged by a mixture of drugs which prevent the HIV virus from multi@@ plying in the body .
However , they have a number of si@@ de-@@ effects .
Moreover , if the prop@@ ag@@ ation of the virus is not completely sup@@ pressed , it can lead to the development of resistant viruses , against which drugs are no longer effective .
The work being done by experts from three institutions , the Czech Academy of Sciences , V@@ Š@@ CH@@ T Prague , and the University of Heidelberg , is opening up the way to deal with the r@@ the virus &apos; resistance .
They have shown that substances known as met@@ all@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus .
Metall@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es are a compo@@ und of bor@@ on , hydro@@ gen , carbon , and co@@ b@@ alt .
These compo@@ unds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today , and so they may get over the resistance problem .
In their work , the scientists are coming up with new ‘ improved ’ compo@@ unds , prepared using knowledge of the molec@@ ular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein .
Metall@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es have a unique three-@@ dimensional structure : two multi-@@ w@@ alled c@@ ages consisting of bor@@ on , hydro@@ gen and carbon at@@ oms are connected to a metal atom , in this case co@@ b@@ alt .
A tre@@ ach@@ erous and har@@ dy virus
The HIV prote@@ ase is the protein of the HIV virus , which is essential to the life-@@ cycle of the virus .
The mature infec@@ tious vi@@ ral cor@@ pus@@ cles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by the HIV prote@@ ase .
If we can stop the HIV prote@@ ase , we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient &apos;s body , the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organ@@ ic Chem@@ istry and Bio@@ chem@@ istry of the Czech Academy of Sciences .
In a paper published in the Journal of Medi@@ cinal Chem@@ istry , the scientists describe a series of compo@@ unds in which there are two pa@@ irs of c@@ ages ( see the diagra@@ m ) connected by a short organic chain , which is then systematically modified .
Some@@ what weaker , but more reliable
The effectiveness of this series of substances against the HIV prote@@ ase has been tested in a te@@ st-@@ tube , as well as its effectiveness against the more immune ( resistant ) stra@@ in as acquired from patients infected with the HIV virus .
The effect of met@@ all@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es on the normal stra@@ in of the enz@@ y@@ me is not as strong as that of drugs used in clinical practice , although their effect is not dimin@@ ished against the resistant stra@@ ins , whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective .
The unique mechanism of the effect and also of its other properties , such as its biological and chemical stability , low tox@@ ic@@ ity , and the possibility of making other chemical modifications , make met@@ all@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es an interesting compo@@ und for future research aimed at sugge@@ sting new effective drugs to combat HIV , says P@@ av@@ l@@ í@@ na Ř@@ e@@ z@@ á@@ č@@ ov@@ á , head of the Structural Bi@@ ology laboratory at the Institute of Organ@@ ic Chem@@ istry and Bio@@ chem@@ istry and the Institute of Mol@@ ec@@ ular Gene@@ tics of the Academy of Sciences .
F@@ all-@@ out over the budget . O@@ DS attacks Fischer , who def@@ ends himself
The head of the O@@ DS , Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k , described the next year &apos;s approved budget as &quot; terrible &quot; and said that Premier Jan Fischer &apos;s government should seriously re@@ think its position in office .
The government chairman described the O@@ DS statement as strong words .
Appar@@ ently he will take some time to think about it .
The vic@@ e-@@ chairman of the O@@ DS , Pet@@ r Ne@@ č@@ as , said that the concept of an interim government supported by the Č@@ SS@@ D , O@@ DS , and Green Party , was evi@@ dently no longer working .
According to Ne@@ č@@ as , the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit , or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left .
The approaches taken by the O@@ DS and social demo@@ crats on the issue of public deficits are diam@@ etri@@ cally opposed , re@@ marked Ne@@ č@@ as .
On Wednesday , the House accepted the budget for 2010 , naturally with the left &apos;s proposed amendments for more than 12 billion cro@@ wns .
The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees , for social services , and for direct payments to farmers .
he government criticised the social demo@@ crats &apos; proposals , saying that they will sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously increase the budget deficit .
The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 16@@ 3 billion cro@@ wns .
Before the vote , the O@@ DS left the room , com@@ plying with the government &apos;s wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the provi@@ sional budget .
Dis@@ appointment and fu@@ tili@@ ty
The finance minister , E@@ du@@ ard Jan@@ ota , has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and fu@@ tili@@ ty , while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation .
Ne@@ č@@ as is convinced that if Jan@@ ota were to really threaten to re@@ sign should the proposed amendments be accepted , the situation would look completely different .
According to Czech Tele@@ vision , Jan@@ ota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session .
At the same time , he indicated that he was re@@ thinking his position in office .
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks .
If Fischer comm@@ its himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit , Ne@@ č@@ as believes that the Č@@ SS@@ D appoin@@ tees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government .
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his re@@ sign@@ ation if the House appro@@ ves other laws that will increase the deficit , those relating to sick pay , pensions , or the amendment to the Civil Ser@@ v@@ ants Act for example .
Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k : Ministers appointed to the O@@ DS have committed no off@@ ence
This is a matter for the ministeri@@ al chairman Fischer and the government as a whole .
Ministers appointed to the O@@ DS have done nothing wrong , stressed Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k in a text report from the USA .
He pointed out that several mini@@ stries employ people in under-@@ secre@@ tary positions who support TO@@ P 09 , which voted against the budget .
Ne@@ č@@ as emphasised that , if Fischer were to decide to re@@ sign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit , &quot; it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House . &quot;
But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil demo@@ crats .
I haven &apos;t thought about it , and I &apos;ll concentrate on that when the time comes , defence minister Martin Bar@@ t@@ á@@ k told re@@ por@@ ters in the House , having been elected by the civil demo@@ crats .
This afternoon , Prime Minister Fischer fle@@ w to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting .
O@@ DS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister
Ne@@ č@@ as also stressed that , on Wednesday in the House , the O@@ DS would evi@@ dently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil demo@@ crats to allow the budget to be approved .
We don &apos;t look like orph@@ ans , we &apos;re not little children , was how he re@@ acted to the question of whether the O@@ DS was not ham@@ pered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget .
I didn &apos;t notice that my vote was missing .
Back when I ren@@ ounced my mandate , I knew that the following months would see the Bol@@ sh@@ ev@@ isation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive , Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k himself responded .
The new Czech Rail@@ ways timetable shows that fewer trains will be running for almost the same fa@@ res
From December 13th , Czech Rail@@ ways will be can@@ c@@ elling or restri@@ cting some less frequ@@ ented express and local trains , but will be adding more services to other lines .
As of the day the new timetable comes into force , there will be two percent fewer services in comparison with now .
Most fa@@ res , including basic and special tickets , will stay the same .
More links to the capital will be available , for example , to the people in the O@@ stra@@ va region , as the railways are adding one P@@ end@@ ol@@ ino to that line .
However , the express will stop running to B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va .
There will be fewer express trains on the Prague - P@@ í@@ se@@ k - Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice route , and the direct service from Prague - Let@@ oh@@ rad will be cut dramatically .
The region planning the greatest transport cuts is the Region of H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ á@@ lov@@ é , with a total cut of eight percent , although Prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a rise .
Two night trains on the Prague - T@@ á@@ bor - Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice line are also being cut , and several express services on the Prague - P@@ í@@ se@@ k - Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice route will be reduced to just a few days a week .
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of the new direct line from Mi@@ lo@@ vice to Prague , since people now travelling from Mi@@ lo@@ vice have to change in Ly@@ s@@ á n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m .
This is the fif@@ teenth line in the E@@ sko sub@@ urban system , which can now be opened since the track from Ly@@ s@@ á n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m to Mi@@ lo@@ vice has been fully electri@@ fied .
Lon@@ g-@@ distance services to the capital will end at the Prague H@@ lav@@ n@@ í n@@ á@@ dra@@ ž@@ í station .
Czech Rail@@ ways is introducing more P@@ end@@ ol@@ ino routes between Prague and O@@ stra@@ va and trains to Š@@ um@@ per@@ k / Jes@@ en@@ í@@ k will run on two-@@ hour inter@@ vals .
From December 13th , passengers will no longer be able to take P@@ end@@ ol@@ ino to B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va .
This year &apos;s cost of regional railways : 200 million more
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport , and next year it will give the railways four billion cro@@ wns to cover demon@@ stra@@ ble losses , the same amount as this year . Local trains are ordered by the regional authorities , who , next year , will pay out a total of eight billion cro@@ wns for them , while almost three billion will be contributed by the state .
This year , regional trains are co@@ sting 200 million more .
Czech Rail@@ ways have concluded a new ten-@@ year contract for local and express trains , whereas , previously , the contract was always for one year .
The railways have pra@@ ised the system , despite the fact that the great majority of fa@@ res have not been increased .
The only changes are to Č@@ D Net one-@@ day network tickets and e@@ Li@@ š@@ ka cheap internet tickets .
Trav@@ ellers without a customer card will find that the Č@@ D Net price has increased from 450 cro@@ wns to 600 cro@@ wns .
The e@@ Li@@ š@@ ka price will now depend on the distance trav@@ elled , whereas , previously , it was a flat rate of 160 cro@@ wns to travel between any regional cities .
Fili@@ p@@ ino gun@@ men still holding more than 50 people , Children have been released
Today , gun@@ men in the south of the Philipp@@ ines ki@@ dn@@ apped 75 people , including several primary school students and their teachers .
This from the AF@@ P agency , which originally announced only 65 ab@@ duc@@ tees .
All 17 of the captured children , together with their teacher , were released after eight hours .
The ki@@ dn@@ app@@ ing happened in the province of Ag@@ us@@ an del S@@ ur .
Around 19 gun@@ men are apparently using the host@@ ages as a human shi@@ eld in their escape from the police .
Local negoti@@ ators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining host@@ ages .
According to AF@@ P , the gun@@ men are part of the New People &apos;s Army ( N@@ PA ) , which is the armed fac@@ tion of the Communist Party of the Philipp@@ ines ( CP@@ P ) .
According to AP , the police had originally been ch@@ asing the ki@@ dn@@ ap@@ pers following violence that occurred as accounts were settled between two local family c@@ lans .
In the province of Mag@@ u@@ in@@ dan@@ ao , in the south of the Philipp@@ ines , mar@@ tial law has been declared due to the recent mass@@ acre which left 57 people dead .
The victims of the mass@@ acre on November 23@@ rd , which was related to the elections for govern@@ or , included 30 re@@ por@@ ters .
The govern@@ or of this southern Fili@@ p@@ ino province has been arrested on suspi@@ cion of involvement in the mass@@ acre , together with his father And@@ al Amp@@ at@@ u@@ an , the patri@@ arch of the influential Amp@@ at@@ u@@ an family .
Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts are also active on Min@@ dan@@ ao .
But on Tuesday , these separ@@ ati@@ sts renewed peace talks with the Fili@@ p@@ ino government .
The story of South Africa affects everyone , says Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an ali@@ as Mand@@ ela
In the next few days , the new Hollywood film In@@ vic@@ tus by Clin@@ t E@@ ast@@ wood will hit American cin@@ em@@ as , depic@@ ting part of the life of the former South African president N@@ elson Mand@@ ela .
The role of the world-@@ famous oppon@@ ent of apar@@ thei@@ d is taken on by Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an , who was apparently chosen years ago by Mand@@ ela himself for his talent .
The supporting male role of the legendary South African ru@@ g@@ by champion Fran@@ co@@ is Pi@@ en@@ a@@ ar is played by Mat@@ t Dam@@ on .
With the film in cin@@ em@@ as critics and the public
N@@ elson Mand@@ ela
N@@ elson Ro@@ li@@ h@@ la@@ h@@ la Mand@@ ela was born on July 18th , 19@@ 18 in M@@ vez , in South Africa .
In 1988 he was awarded the Sak@@ har@@ ov Prize for Freedom of Th@@ ought , and in 1993 received the Nobel Peace Prize with de K@@ ler@@ k .
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 .
There were great expectations , as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa busy preparing for the football world champ@@ ionship , but the media was also ri@@ fe with worrying news about increasing ra@@ cial hat@@ red and discrimination by the black majority .
According to the AP news agency , the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in South Africa , despite the number of objections to &quot; br@@ at-@@ pack &quot; Hollywood stars being cast in the main roles .
However , despite what he says , Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an is proud of the new film .
I had dre@@ amt about this role for many years and prepared for it well .
I met N@@ elson Mand@@ ela many times to , as they say , draw on his energy , he said in an interview after the film &apos;s grand premi@@ ere in Los Angeles .
I think it &apos;s good that we can commem@@ or@@ ate Mand@@ ela and his mission in a film .
It is a story about South Africa , but it affects everybody , he added .
In the national ru@@ g@@ by team uniform
The film , based on the book by the British writer John Car@@ lin , entitled Pla@@ ying the En@@ em@@ y : N@@ elson Mand@@ ela and the Game that Made a Nation , portra@@ ys the South African human rights activ@@ ist during his first presidential election campaign .
In the film , Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so long been se@@ gre@@ gated and , like N@@ elson Mand@@ ela did in 1995 , appears in the film in the South African national ru@@ g@@ by uniform at the world cup match , which was won by South Africa .
For appearing in the kit , which is an almost sac@@ red symbol in South Africa , four@@ teen years ago , Mand@@ ela received a standing ov@@ ation from the predomin@@ antly white spec@@ t@@ ators and gained the este@@ em of the white people .
Perhaps a football champ@@ ionship can actually bring people together as one nation , said ru@@ g@@ by player Ch@@ ester Willi@@ ams , who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team .
Whether the ten@@ se situation in South Africa will improve is only now becoming apparent .
White South Afri@@ cans , however , are scep@@ tical , as ru@@ g@@ by fan Christop@@ her Da@@ w@@ son , who fl@@ ed the country to go to Britain , admitted in a recent interview for L@@ N .
The champ@@ ionship begins on June 11th , 2010 .
Trans@@ former worth tens of millions of cro@@ wns bur@@ ns in Lo@@ un@@ y region
In the morning , a fire broke out in a trans@@ former owned by Č@@ ep@@ s at the switching station in the village of V@@ ý@@ š@@ kov , near Lo@@ un@@ y .
Six fire engines came out to fight the fire , said the spo@@ kes@@ man for the Ú@@ st@@ í regional fire@@ figh@@ ters , Lu@@ k@@ á@@ š Mar@@ van .
Origin@@ ally , the fire@@ figh@@ ters wanted to let the trans@@ former burn , but later changed their minds and are putting the fire out using a mix of water , fo@@ am , and special fi@@ re-@@ sup@@ pression agents .
The fire was caused by a technical fault , a short circuit inside the trans@@ former .
N@@ obo@@ dy was hur@@ t , and according to company spo@@ kes@@ person P@@ av@@ la Mand@@ á@@ to@@ v@@ á , the incident will not hin@@ der the safe operation of the distribution station .
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of cro@@ wns , although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
Mand@@ á@@ to@@ v@@ á says that the ru@@ ined trans@@ former will have to be replaced with a new one .
She added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that Č@@ ep@@ s has been operating , and this kind of fault was a one-@@ off .
According to Č@@ E@@ Z spo@@ kes@@ woman for northern Boh@@ em@@ ia , Son@@ ia Hol@@ inger@@ ov@@ á H@@ end@@ ry@@ cho@@ v@@ á , there were no power cuts and households , offices and companies were not affected by the trans@@ former fire .
In the Czech Republic , the joint stock company Č@@ ep@@ s is the exclusive operator of transmission systems and 400 k@@ V and 220 k@@ V power lines .
It maintains , re@@ stores and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transform@@ ers conver@@ ting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system , as well as 4@@ 3@@ 39 kilometres of power lines .
Jan@@ č@@ ura files a s@@ lander suit against three Č@@ SS@@ D commission@@ ers
The owner of Stu@@ dent Agency , Radi@@ m Jan@@ č@@ ura , will today file a s@@ lander suit against three social democra@@ t commission@@ ers .
These are Mich@@ al Ha@@ š@@ ek , commission@@ er for South Mor@@ a@@ via , Rad@@ ko Mart@@ í@@ ne@@ k , commission@@ er for Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce , and Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c commission@@ er Martin T@@ es@@ a@@ ř@@ í@@ k .
Jan@@ č@@ ura announced this in the T@@ w@@ enty Minutes programme on Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l .
The suit relates to the company &apos;s attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions .
However , all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Rail@@ ways .
So now all three commission@@ ers are att@@ acking us and saying that we &apos;re getting the best out of it , while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted .
They claim that we &apos;re more expensive than Czech Rail@@ ways , which is not true , as we know the Czech Rail@@ ways prices that were concluded last week .
So all we can do is defend ourselves .
It &apos;s for s@@ lander against Stu@@ dent Agency , Jan@@ č@@ ura told Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l .
He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law .
He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission .
Ha@@ š@@ ek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jan@@ č@@ ura &apos;s great media show , which works as a free adverti@@ sement for himself and his company .
It &apos;s understandable that I &apos;m prepared to defend my good name and that of my region , and I call upon the other commission@@ ers to do the same .
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jan@@ č@@ ura who is manipul@@ ating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments , said Ha@@ š@@ ek .
Last week , Jan@@ č@@ ura said that he is investing several million cro@@ wns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities .
He told Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l that he was hal@@ ting the campaign for Christmas and would re@@ start it in the New Year .
He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such .
Jan@@ č@@ ura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Rail@@ ways and had not announced ten@@ ders for the order , worth around 150 billion cro@@ wns .
According to Jan@@ č@@ ura this is illegal and in contra@@ vention of the principles of the European Court of Justice .
Jan@@ č@@ ura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the Č@@ SS@@ D .
The only threat was that if we don &apos;t stop this , we could lose our bus licence .
He introduced himself as a member of the Č@@ SS@@ D , I know who it was but I &apos;m not going to say his name , Jan@@ č@@ ura told Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l today .
V@@ acc@@ inations against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us will be free and voluntary .
Starting January , vacc@@ inations against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us will radi@@ cally change ing@@ ra@@ ined hab@@ its .
These should be the first free yet voluntary vacc@@ inations for families .
But some are saying that compulsory vacc@@ inations would be more effective .
Pre@@ par@@ ations for the introduction of free anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations are reaching a peak .
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vacc@@ ines to be paid for by health insurance companies .
Exper@@ ts are now clear on how to proceed with the vacc@@ inations .
New vacc@@ inations
V@@ acc@@ ines free of charge for children born in August
Starting January , there could be free anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations for children born on or after August 2nd .
The condition is that they have not received any prior vacc@@ inations .
Anyone who began to be vacc@@ inated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-@@ vacc@@ inations .
The first bat@@ ch of vacc@@ inations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old .
Last year , one in four families had their children volun@@ t@@ arily vacc@@ inated against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us .
Par@@ ents paid 16@@ 00 cro@@ wns or more per vacc@@ ination .
The young@@ est children require four vacc@@ inations .
Overall , experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand cro@@ wns a year on vacc@@ inations .
But they save on the treatment that un@@ vacc@@ inated children would otherwise need .
So far , the state has been paying around 500 thousand cro@@ wns a year on all general vacc@@ inations for children .
Sub@@ si@@ dis@@ ed vacc@@ inations were introduced as part of the Jan@@ ota package .
P@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us causes infec@@ tions of the middle ear , but also serious infec@@ tions of the cer@@ eb@@ ral m@@ embran@@ es and blood po@@ is@@ oning .
P@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ al infec@@ tions claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year , according to hospital figures .
Besides the Czech Republic , around 40 countries have introduced general anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations for children .
Will vacc@@ inations be compulsory ?
Some believe that in the future these vacc@@ inations could be compulsory .
As of January , they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory .
The head of the N@@ ahl@@ as civil association , Ru@@ dol@@ f K@@ alo@@ v@@ sk@@ ý , says that compulsory vacc@@ inations would be better .
His association has long been promoting p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ ines .
The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vacc@@ inations .
It &apos;s not completely ideal .
On the other hand , we &apos;re happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vacc@@ inations in place .
I think this is the route we have to take , said K@@ alo@@ v@@ sk@@ ý .
The Ministry of Health , however , does not want to change the p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ ination system .
We &apos;re not considering it at this time , said mini@@ stry spo@@ kes@@ man V@@ las@@ tim@@ il S@@ r@@ š@@ e@@ ň .
Vol@@ un@@ tary vacc@@ inations have their draw@@ backs , say doctors
The chair@@ woman of the Professional Society of Pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians , H@@ ana Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á , acknowled@@ ges that voluntary vacc@@ inations have their draw@@ backs .
If all children were vacc@@ inated , the number of rev@@ acc@@ inations could then be cut . &quot; With vacc@@ ines co@@ sting so much , we can understand the political decision that vacc@@ inations should be offered on a voluntary basis , &quot; says Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á .
Exper@@ ts assume that , starting next year , more than 80 percent of new parents will have their bab@@ ies vacc@@ inated against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us .
The anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations are a mile@@ stone in that they are the first general vacc@@ inations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies , not the state .
In@@ surance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment , explains Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á .
Doc@@ tors will have to buy vacc@@ ines themselves
However , practi@@ sing pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians are concerned when it comes to buying the vacc@@ ines .
According to the original plan , the vacc@@ ines would be purchased by the insurance companies , and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vacc@@ inations .
Some ministers , however , are worried that the insurance companies could &quot; run wild with health insurance funds &quot; .
So doctors will have to buy the vacc@@ ines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money .
It is estimated that practi@@ sing pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vacc@@ ines , which is a lot of money .
It certainly won &apos;t be easy , says Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á .
US artist &apos;s son &apos; in museum the@@ ft@@ &apos;
The son of renowned American fantas@@ y artist Frank Fra@@ z@@ etta , has been charged with trying to ste@@ al paintings worth $ 20@@ m ( £ 12@@ m ) from his father &apos;s museum .
Police in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania say Al@@ fon@@ so Frank Fra@@ z@@ etta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and tra@@ iler .
They say Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta and another man used an excav@@ ator to break into the museum in the Po@@ con@@ o Mountains region .
Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta Sn@@ r , aged 81 , is fam@@ ed for his depic@@ tion of characters such as Con@@ an the Bar@@ b@@ arian and Tar@@ z@@ an .
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident , the Associ@@ ated Press news agency reported .
AP quoted an un@@ named police official as saying the younger Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta may have been motivated by a family feu@@ d .
A police aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it said Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta J@@ n@@ r , 52 , claimed he had been instruc@@ ted by his father to &quot; enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a storage facility &quot; , the agency reported .
Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta Sn@@ r denied granting any such permission , the agency said .
Labour def@@ ends budget tax rises
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre-@@ Budget report against criticism from the opposition , business and unions .
The T@@ ories said Ali@@ sta@@ ir Dar@@ ling &quot; ble@@ w &quot; an opportunity to show he was serious about cutting the deficit by dela@@ ying decisions until after the election .
The chan@@ cell@@ or also came under fire for hit@@ ting low and middle income workers .
Among his head@@ line proposals are a 0.5 % rise in National In@@ surance and a 1 % cap on public pay settlements from 2011 .
National In@@ surance anger
Uni@@ ons have prote@@ sted that low-@@ paid workers are being pen@@ alised for a recession not of their making and warned of &quot; problems &quot; ahead .
The National In@@ surance increase - which will raise about £ 3@@ bn a year - has an@@ gered the business community , which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery .
The increase , limited to those earning more than £ 20@@ ,000 a year , will hit about 10 million workers .
KE@@ Y PO@@ IN@@ TS OF P@@ B@@ R
National In@@ surance up by a further 0.5 % from April 2011
Economy to shr@@ ink by worse than expected 4.@@ 75 % this year
New 50 % tax on ban@@ ker bon@@ uses
1@@ p rise in cor@@ poration tax for small firms scra@@ pped
Ta@@ x reb@@ ates for electric cars and wind tur@@ bin@@ es
State pension to rise by 2.5 %
According to Treas@@ ury estimates , someone earning £ 30@@ ,000 will be £ 90 a year worse off and someone on £ 40@@ ,000 will be £ 190 worse off , while someone earning £ 10,000 a year will be £ 110 better off .
Ministers said their target of hal@@ ving the deficit by 2013 meant &quot; difficult decisions &quot; but insi@@ sted that 60 % of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5 % of ear@@ ners .
Treas@@ ury minister Stephen Tim@@ ms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a &quot; drop in the ocean &quot; compared to what was needed .
&quot; These are large numbers . They will deliver for us this hal@@ ving of the deficit which is absolutely essential over the next four years , &quot; he told the BBC .
Mr Tim@@ ms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the turn of the year .
However , Labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to bor@@ row and how quickly he deficit is cut - have been ques@@ tioned after the chan@@ cell@@ or was forced to rev@@ ise earlier figures .
In his statement , he said the economy was likely to contract 4.@@ 75 % this year - far worse than the 3.5 % decline predic@@ ted in April - while borro@@ wing would be £ 3@@ bn higher than earlier estimated .
&apos;@@ Blo@@ wn opport@@ un@@ it@@ y@@ &apos;
The Con@@ servatives , who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour &apos;s &quot; debt crisis &quot; , said projec@@ ted borro@@ wing of £ 7@@ 8@@ 9@@ bn over the next six years was un@@ sustainable .
M@@ n@@ ist@@ ers had failed to lay out a credible plan for how they would pay this back , they added , &quot; cy@@ n@@ ically &quot; du@@ cking tough choices until after the election - which must be held by June 2010 .
&quot; They have not included anything of significance they are going to do , &quot; said shadow Treas@@ ury minister Phili@@ p Ham@@ mond . &quot; They had an opportunity to do it and they have blo@@ wn it . &quot;
&quot; The all important announ@@ cements will come after the election , wh@@ o@@ ever wins it &quot;
Ro@@ ger Boot@@ le , Del@@ o@@ it@@ te
Labour insist that schools , hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts unlike under T@@ ory proposals which would see the deficit cut faster and further .
But the Li@@ b D@@ ems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit , argu@@ ing the plans were &quot; built on sand &quot; .
The BBC &apos;s political editor N@@ ick Rob@@ inson said some of the timing of the announ@@ cements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chan@@ cell@@ or open to accus@@ ations of elec@@ tion@@ e@@ ering as the money may simply be cla@@ wed back the year after .
However , Labour insist the extra help is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010 .
&apos;@@ P@@ hon@@ ey bud@@ get@@ &apos;
Although ministers did not publish spending details for beyond 2011 , economists said it was clear the squ@@ ee@@ ze on public spending would only begin to b@@ ite in the medium term .
The respected Institute for Fis@@ cal Studies said the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s figures imp@@ lied substantial cuts in many areas , potentially including transport , higher education , science and defence , in the future .
&quot; It really is holding off the pain until later , &quot; said its director Robert Cho@@ te .
&quot; The all important announ@@ cements will come after the election , wh@@ o@@ ever wins it , &quot; added Ro@@ ger Boot@@ le , economic adv@@ iser to accoun@@ tan@@ ts Del@@ o@@ it@@ te .
&quot; This has been the ph@@ on@@ ey pre-@@ Budget report . The markets realise this . &quot;
F@@ B@@ I prob@@ es &apos; US Pakistan ar@@ rest@@ s@@ &apos;
The F@@ B@@ I is investig@@ ating the arrest in Pakistan of five reported US men on suspi@@ cion of extrem@@ ist links .
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sar@@ gh@@ o@@ da in eastern Pun@@ j@@ ab province , Pakistan &apos;s US emb@@ assy told the BBC .
The F@@ B@@ I has said it is investig@@ ating whether they are the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the US state of Vir@@ g@@ inia last month .
The US State Department said it was also seeking information on the men .
Three of them are reported to be of Pakist@@ ani des@@ cent , one of Egyptian heritage and the other of a Y@@ em@@ en@@ i background .
&quot; If they are American citizens , we of course are going to be very interested in the charges that they &apos;ve been de@@ tained on and in what sort of circumstances they &apos;re being held , &quot; said spo@@ kes@@ man I@@ an Kel@@ ly .
F@@ B@@ I spo@@ kes@@ woman Ka@@ ther@@ ine Sch@@ weit said the agency was aware of the arre@@ sts and was in contact with the families of the missing students .
&quot; We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identi@@ ties and the nature of their business there , if indeed these are the students who had gone missing , &quot; she said .
The Pakist@@ ani emb@@ assy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an un@@ cle of one of them .
He said the house was already of interest to local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men .
Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton dec@@ lined to comment on the arre@@ sts , reported the Re@@ uters news agency , but said the US had to &quot; work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recru@@ it and train people &quot; .
The five students were reported missing from their homes in northern Vir@@ g@@ inia by their families in late November .
Am@@ nesty condem@@ ns Iranian &apos; ab@@ us@@ es@@ &apos;
Human rights in Iran are as poor as at any time over the past 20 years , according to a report from campaign group Am@@ nesty International .
The report details &quot; patterns of abuse &quot; by the regime before and after disp@@ uted presidential elections in June .
One man quoted in the report said he had been be@@ aten and bur@@ ned with cigare@@ ttes . Another said he was threatened with rap@@ e .
Iran has dis@@ missed previous criticism of its human rights record .
Off@@ ici@@ als have said such criticism is politically motivated .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of people were arrested and doz@@ ens killed in Iran after the disp@@ uted election of President Mah@@ mou@@ d Ah@@ ma@@ d@@ ine@@ j@@ ad led to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Do@@ z@@ ens have been given j@@ ail terms , and prosec@@ ut@@ ors say at least five people have been sent@@ enced to death .
BBC Teh@@ ran correspon@@ dent , J@@ on Le@@ y@@ ne , who is now in London , says that early in the protests , the su@@ preme leader , Ay@@ at@@ ol@@ lah Ali Kh@@ amen@@ ei , accepted some of the alleg@@ ations of abuse , ordering the closure of the K@@ ah@@ ri@@ z@@ ak detention centre .
But since then , there has been almost no tolerance of criticism by the authorities , our correspon@@ dent says .
&apos;@@ Fal@@ se conf@@ ession@@ &apos;
Am@@ nesty International c@@ ited the account of 26@@ -@@ year-old comp@@ uting student E@@ bra@@ him M@@ eh@@ tar@@ i , who said he was accused of &quot; working with Facebook networks &quot; and prote@@ sting against the election result .
&quot; They frequently beat me on the face , &quot; he was quoted as saying .
&quot; I was bur@@ ned with cigare@@ ttes under my eyes , on the neck , head ... They threatened to execute me and they hum@@ ili@@ ated me . &quot;
After five days he signed a false conf@@ ession and was taken out and left in the street , still ble@@ eding and semi-@@ conscious , Am@@ nesty said .
In August , defe@@ ated presidential candidate M@@ eh@@ di Kar@@ ro@@ ub@@ i said some prote@@ sters de@@ tained after the election had been tor@@ tured to death in prison and others had been rap@@ ed .
Iranian officials denied the rap@@ e claims , but admitted that abuses had taken place .
Am@@ nesty also c@@ ited the case of a former de@@ tain@@ ee who said he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre at K@@ ah@@ ri@@ z@@ ak .
Am@@ nesty accepted that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-@@ election un@@ rest and the government &apos;s response , but it said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the parliamentary committee &apos;s findings had not been made public .
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to fore@@ st@@ all further demonstrations .
Ski slope is created in city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol land@@ mark into a pi@@ ste for a competition .
The Pi@@ ste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-@@ professional ski@@ ers and snow borders competing for cash prizes .
At the top of the slope in Brand@@ on Hill park there was a short jump ra@@ mp before a 100@@ m-@@ long slope .
Four@@ th-@@ year medical student John Hi@@ ck@@ man said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope but it was pretty da@@ un@@ ting .
It &apos;s a beautiful view with all the city lights below all tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing .
There &apos;s some of the best ski@@ ers and snow borders in the county here - some real talent , &quot; he added .
Pri@@ zes were awarded for the best tri@@ cks - or manoeu@@ v@@ res performed on the slope .
After Thursday evening &apos;s event the snow will be left to melt away .
Still them and us
Can Islam Be French ?
Plu@@ rali@@ sm and Pra@@ gmati@@ sm in a Sec@@ ular@@ ist State .
AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of min@@ are@@ ts and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islam@@ isation of Europe , John Bo@@ wen , an American academic , has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate — and are integrating — into one of the continent ’ s most avo@@ we@@ dly secular societies .
Some readers will come to this new book as ad@@ mir@@ ers of the author ’ s last work , &quot; Why the French Don ’ t Like Head@@ scar@@ ves &quot; ( 2006 ) , an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and pre@@ occupied the country for a decade and a half , and whose effects are still felt today .
Mr Bo@@ wen ’ s latest book has a broader and more ambitious can@@ vas .
As a good anth@@ rop@@ ologist , he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France , but what is actually happening on the ground .
He has spent months in the mos@@ ques , schools and institutes which now provide France ’ s 5@@ m-@@ 6@@ m Muslims with what Mr Bo@@ wen calls &quot; Islamic spaces &quot; .
He is a good listen@@ er , re@@ producing debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most .
Should a Muslim get married in a mos@@ que or a town hall ( or both ) ?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and ga@@ y rights ?
Can a Muslim woman mar@@ ry a non-@@ Muslim man ?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest@@ -based banking system to get a mort@@ gage ?
It is these seem@@ ingly m@@ und@@ ane issues , he argu@@ es , that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dra@@ mas that pre@@ occup@@ y the media .
The author identi@@ fies a new generation of im@@ ams , teachers and intellec@@ tu@@ als , none of them household names , with the possible exception of Tari@@ q Ram@@ ad@@ an , a Swis@@ s-@@ born Arab Muslim schol@@ ar and academic .
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society .
They are not having the argument all their way .
Con@@ servatives are suspi@@ cious of the very idea of a French or European Islam .
The th@@ ink@@ ers and activists whom Mr Bo@@ wen interviews tend to be at od@@ ds with their Sal@@ af@@ i counter@@ parts — advocates of the pur@@ ist Sun@@ ni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia — who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe ’ s Muslims .
Mr Bo@@ wen thinks that Muslim values and French sec@@ ular@@ ism could be compatible .
But accommodation requires gi@@ ve-@@ and-@@ take on both sides .
He questions how far French policymakers ( and the intellectual elite that so fi@@ erc@@ ely guards la@@ ï@@ cit@@ é ) are really committed to plurali@@ sm .
He suggests that Muslims are probably getting a ra@@ wer deal than the Catho@@ lic@@ s , Prote@@ stants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republi@@ can@@ ism .
Rather than a growing pragmati@@ sm , he dete@@ cts a &quot; tigh@@ tening of the valu@@ e-@@ scre@@ ws &quot; .
Can Islam be French ? After reading this book , one is inc@@ lined to say , &quot; Yes , but not yet . &quot;
The ble@@ ak@@ est outlook in the world
THE Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environment on the planet .
The ice that defines it is mel@@ ting with alarming speed , taking with it life that can survive no@@ where else .
Oil , gas , shipping and fishing interests have been heading into the newly open water , with diplom@@ ats , lawyers , and now authors , in their wake .
In &quot; On Th@@ in I@@ ce &quot; Richard El@@ lis , a writer and illustr@@ ator , pain@@ ts a natural history of the icon of the north , the pol@@ ar bear .
Well@@ -@@ ver@@ sed in the complicated history and politics of wh@@ aling , he describes the long tradition of Arctic expl@@ or@@ ers who proved themselves by taking on the white bear .
Ad@@ mi@@ ral N@@ elson ’ s encounter as a plu@@ cky 14-@@ year-old mid@@ ship@@ man fighting only with the but@@ t of his mus@@ ket is surely a my@@ th , but others are true .
Young bears , captured as they sw@@ am after the bodies of their newly killed mothers , were caught and sent to z@@ oo@@ s and cir@@ c@@ uses .
One early 20@@ th-@@ century big@@ -@@ top act featured 75 pol@@ ar bears at once .
Even today , zo@@ o en@@ clo@@ sures are still typically a milli@@ on@@ th of the area of a wild adult ’ s range . The climate is rarely suitable : the resident pol@@ ar bear in Singapore has turned green from al@@ ga@@ e growing within the hol@@ low ha@@ irs of its coat .

Mr El@@ lis draws on the accounts of other writers and hist@@ ori@@ ans , and often returns to the threat that h@@ unter@@ s pose to the survival of the species .
Although banned in Norway , America and Russia , the killing continues in Green@@ land and Canada , where h@@ unter@@ s in helicop@@ ters and ski@@ do@@ o-@@ riding In@@ u@@ it Indi@@ ans both use high-@@ powered ass@@ ault ri@@ f@@ les to bring down their quar@@ ry .
Iron@@ ically it is in the waters towards the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longest .
In his new book , &quot; After the I@@ ce &quot; , A@@ lu@@ n Ander@@ son , a former editor of New Scienti@@ st , offers a clear and ch@@ illing account of the science of the Arctic and a gri@@ pping gli@@ mp@@ se of how the future may turn out there .
Not that scientists have all the answers .
Neither atmosp@@ her@@ ic scientists nor o@@ ce@@ an@@ ograph@@ ers can adequately account for the speed of the changes .

He was one of more than 6@@ ,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place w@@ re@@ a@@ ths on veter@@ ans &apos; gra@@ ve@@ sites across several sections of Ar@@ ling@@ ton Cer@@ em@@ ony .

U.S. government contrac@@ tor arrested by Cuban officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contrac@@ tor who was distribut@@ ing cell@@ phones and laptop computers in the country , State Department officials said Saturday .
The contrac@@ tor , who has not yet been identified , works for Development Altern@@ atives Inc . , based in Be@@ th@@ es@@ da .
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank .
Consul@@ ar officers with the U.S. Inter@@ est Section in Hav@@ ana are seeking access to the de@@ tain@@ ee , who was arrested Dec@@ . 5 .
The specific charges have not been made public , though under Cuban law , a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of &quot; danger@@ ousness . &quot;
All so-called counter-@@ revolutionary activities , which include mild protests and critical w@@ rit@@ ings , carry the risk of arrest .
Anti-@@ government gra@@ ff@@ iti and speech are considered serious crimes .
Cuba has a fle@@ dging blo@@ gging community , led by the popular comm@@ ent@@ ator Yo@@ ani S@@ án@@ che@@ z , who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and har@@ ass@@ ed by government agents .
S@@ án@@ che@@ z has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards but has been denied permission .
The detention of an American contrac@@ tor may likely raise tensions between the Castro brothers Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration , which has been pursuing a &quot; go@@ -@@ slow &quot; approach to improving relations with the island .
News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times Friday night .
The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps , such as fre@@ eing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition , the United States will reciproc@@ ate .
C@@ ell@@ phones and lap@@ tops are legal in Cuba , though they are new and co@@ v@@ eted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $ 15 a month .
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cell@@ phones just this year ; they are used mostly for tex@@ ting , as a 15-@@ minute telephone conversation would eat up a day &apos;s wages .
Internet use is extremely limited on the island .
It is available in expensive hotels and to foreign visitors there , and at some government out@@ lets , such as universities .
Cub@@ ans who want to log on often have to give their names to the government .
Access to many Web sites is restricted .
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare .
Most of the hand@@ ful of U.S. citizens in j@@ ail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smu@@ ggling , said Gl@@ oria Ber@@ ben@@ a , the press officer at the U.S. Inter@@ ests Section in Hav@@ ana .
Ber@@ ben@@ a said she could not provide more information on the arrest .
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong .
An activity that in any other open society would be legal -- giving away free cell@@ phones -- is in Cuba a crime , said J@@ ose Miguel Vi@@ v@@ anc@@ o , director of the Americ@@ as program of the group Human Rights Watch , which recently issued a tough report on freedoms in Cuba called &quot; New Castro , S@@ ame Cuba , &quot; a reference to the installation of Rau@@ l Castro as the leader of the country to replace his ailing older brother F@@ ide@@ l .
Vi@@ v@@ anc@@ o said that the accused are often arrested , tried and im@@ pris@@ oned in a day .
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provo@@ kes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries begin to move toward more dialogue .
Pakist@@ ani officials un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakist@@ ani authorities on Saturday zer@@ o@@ ed in on the alleged master@@ mind of a plot to send five Northern Vir@@ g@@ inia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops , saying they hope the case could help un@@ ra@@ vel an extensive network of terrorist recru@@ it@@ ers who sc@@ our the Internet for ra@@ dic@@ alized young men .
Investi@@ g@@ ators said they were hunting for a sha@@ dow@@ y insur@@ gent figure known as Sa@@ i@@ ful@@ lah , who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments appro@@ ving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube .
Sa@@ i@@ ful@@ lah guided the men once they were in Pakistan , attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan &apos;s tri@@ bal belt that is home to al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da and its terrorist training camps .
But a Pakist@@ ani intelligence official who had been brie@@ fed on the case said Saturday that Sa@@ i@@ ful@@ lah was un@@ successful in convincing al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da comm@@ anders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate the terrorist network .
As a result , they were mar@@ o@@ oned for days in the eastern city of Sar@@ go@@ d@@ ha , far from the forbi@@ d@@ ding mountains of the nor@@ thwest that have become a terrorist haven .
They were regarded as a sting operation .
That &apos;s why they were rejected , said the official , who spoke on the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity because of the sensitivity of the case .
The official said the men were un@@ deter@@ red and were still trying to acquire the right endor@@ sements to gain access to the al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da camps when they were arrested by Pakist@@ ani law enforcement .
The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being ques@@ tioned by the F@@ B@@ I -- under@@ scores the critical role of recru@@ it@@ ers in identifying potential terrorists and , perhaps more importantly , determining who can be tru@@ sted .
Since the S@@ ept . 11 , 2001 , attacks , U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da .
The organization &apos;s recru@@ it@@ ers act as g@@ ate@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to hol@@ y war , and those who could be sp@@ ies .
W@@ oul@@ d-@@ be American recru@@ its are treated by al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da with special scrutiny , an@@ alyst@@ s said .
But they are also considered enor@@ m@@ ously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value .
But E@@ van Koh@@ l@@ mann , senior analy@@ st with the U.@@ S.@@ -based NE@@ F@@ A Foundation , said terror groups have also become much more cau@@ tious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recru@@ iting methods .
If you &apos;re trying to s@@ ink someone into these groups , what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed ? Koh@@ l@@ mann said .
The model is one that has become far more Web@@ -based .
T@@ ens of thousands protest in Copenhagen , demand climate &apos; ac@@ tion@@ &apos;
T@@ ens of thousands of prote@@ sters mar@@ ched on the streets here Saturday , demanding b@@ older action on climate from the negoti@@ ators working inside the city &apos;s B@@ ella Convention Center .
Prote@@ sters said as many 100@@ ,000 people joined in the event , but police estimated the count was closer to 25@@ ,000 .
The event was relatively peaceful , though a hand@@ ful of mas@@ ked activists set off small explo@@ si@@ ves near a group of government buildings downtown .
On a day when little happened in the U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ spon@@ sored climate talks , thousands of activists wal@@ ked across the city holding bann@@ ers in English saying &quot; There is No Planet B &quot; and one in Spanish declar@@ ing , &quot; The Earth is Sa@@ ying , &apos; En@@ ough . &apos; 
Several celeb@@ ri@@ ties joined the protest , including Danish model and photographer Hel@@ ena Ch@@ risten@@ sen , who said that traveling to her mother &apos;s native country of Peru made me aware of the hear@@ t@@ breaking issues the country is dealing with due to the imp@@ acts of climate changes that are already occurring . &quot;
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big mar@@ ch -- to pass on the word and to appeal to the world &apos;s leaders to deliver a fair , ambitious and binding deal , she said .
It is not an easy task , but it needs to be done , there is no way around it anymore .
The police kept the prote@@ sters from getting too close to the B@@ ella center , and said they had arrested 19 people , primarily on the grounds that they had either worn mas@@ ks or carried po@@ cket kni@@ ves .
Those activities are banned during demonstrations under Danish law .
According to one b@@ yst@@ ander , who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks , activists sporting mas@@ ks and black out@@ fits set off several explo@@ si@@ ves near Copenhagen &apos;s main can@@ al , which is nearby several mini@@ stries .
They were lob@@ bing them by the buildings , he said , adding they began as fla@@ res but were followed by &quot; a couple big explo@@ sions . &quot;
In@@ side the convention center , people gathered around television screens to watch the mar@@ ch throughout the afternoon .
But the protest did not seem to penet@@ rate the consciousness of key officials such as S@@ u We@@ i , China &apos;s chief climate negoti@@ ator .
When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on the international deliber@@ ations , he rep@@ lied in English , &quot; Ac@@ tually , that is something that I was not aware of . &quot;
He then continued in Mand@@ arin , saying , &quot; Because the venue is large , I cannot hear what is happening outside . &quot;
He observed that whether the mar@@ ch was hur@@ ting or helping depen@@ ded on one &apos;s perspective .
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change , he said .
On the other hand , &quot; You can also say that they dis@@ rupt the negotiations , or the freedom of other people .
Test data reveal st@@ ub@@ born ra@@ cial gaps
Last week &apos;s federal report card on math achievement was a welcome piece of good news for D.@@ C. public schools .
Although the District still lags far behind the country &apos;s top-@@ performing systems , the report card showed four@@ th@@ - and eigh@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders making stri@@ des at a faster pace over the past two years than cities including Atlan@@ ta , Chicago and New York .
But what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the National Ass@@ ess@@ ment of Educ@@ ational Pro@@ gress is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white students both locally and nation@@ ally .
The average scores of white D.@@ C. four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders over the past two years grew from 26@@ 2 to 2@@ 70 ( on a scale of 500 ) , but their African American pe@@ ers &apos; rose just three points , from 20@@ 9 to 2@@ 12 .
The achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009 , from 53 to 58 points .
African American progress in the eigh@@ th grade remained essentially flat , di@@ pping a statisti@@ cally in@@ significant one point , from 2@@ 45 to 24@@ 4 .
A@@ verage white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size wasn &apos;t large enough .
The picture across a six-@@ year stretch isn &apos;t more encouraging .
The gap separ@@ ating white and black four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders in 2003 , when the first NA@@ EP in the District was given , was 60 scale points ( 26@@ 2 to 20@@ 2 ) .
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period , the difference has barely narro@@ wed to 58 .
Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Mich@@ elle A. R@@ he@@ e and Mayor Adri@@ an M. F@@ enty ( D ) were prop@@ elled largely by white students who are already high achie@@ vers .
It would suggest that we &apos;ve raised the aggre@@ gate by treating those at the higher end of the scale , which is problematic and troub@@ les@@ ome , said Je@@ ff Smith , executive director of D.@@ C. Vo@@ ice , a non@@ profit group that advocates for educational equality in the District .
I &apos;m not j@@ umping up and down about a tw@@ o@@ - or three-@@ point spread , said D.@@ C. Council member K@@ w@@ ame R. Brown ( D-@@ At Large ) , who has a daughter in the fourth grade at E@@ aton Ele@@ mentary .
A frequent cri@@ tic of R@@ he@@ e &apos;s management style , Brown said the message of the test scores is that the city &apos;s middle schools are in desper@@ ate need of attention .
Clearly , you always want to see the plus signs , and I respect that .
But what &apos;s sc@@ ary is we &apos;re not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools .
R@@ he@@ e said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-@@ achieving students .
This fall , for example , some teachers are being trained to use a new reading cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the Wil@@ son Re@@ ading System , targeted to students in the upper elem@@ entary and middle school grades who didn &apos;t master the basi@@ cs of reading early in their school care@@ ers and are significantly behind their pe@@ ers .
Every@@ day Mathemati@@ cs , a K-@@ throu@@ gh@@ -@@ six@@ th-@@ grade math cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um emphasi@@ zing games and real-@@ life experiences that was brought to the District under former super@@ inten@@ dent Cli@@ ff@@ ord Jan@@ ey , is credited with some of the NA@@ EP progress reported last week .
I just think we have to keep working at bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level , R@@ he@@ e said .
Others say that the NA@@ EP &apos;s results highlight the question of whether R@@ he@@ e can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-@@ performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap .
There is a sort of rou@@ gh@@ -@@ ed@@ ged di@@ lemma here for Mich@@ elle R@@ he@@ e , said Bru@@ ce Ful@@ ler , an education professor at the University of California at Ber@@ kel@@ ey who studies urban test scores .
The conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest sections of D.@@ C .
So the targe@@ ting may yield political repercussions that go against that important agenda .
But the ru@@ b , of course , is like other urban super@@ inten@@ dents , she &apos;s trying to hold on to the white and black middle class .
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools .
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families , regardless of where they live , are confident that their children can get an excellent public education .
Jan@@ ey , now super@@ inten@@ dent of schools in Ne@@ war@@ k , said in an interview this week that one essential element to closing the achievement gap is to leng@@ then the traditional public school year , currently 180 days in the District , to compete with charter schools .
You have to get up near 200 days to have the force of change , said Jan@@ ey , who came to agreement with his teachers &apos; union last year on a 18@@ 5-@@ day year , which he regards as &quot; a mark@@ er &quot; for seeking a bigger increase in the next contract .
Making higher education a part of more fut@@ ures
The tour bus pul@@ led into G@@ ett@@ ys@@ burg College with a loud whe@@ e@@ ze .
Gra@@ ci@@ ela Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , 12 , step@@ ped off and b@@ linked for a moment at the white columns , bri@@ ck fac@@ ades and emer@@ ald la@@ wns .
Gra@@ ci@@ ela &apos;s parents had barely gradu@@ ated from high school in El Salvador .
Until recently , Gra@@ ci@@ ela herself , who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Ri@@ ver@@ d@@ ale , had never set foot on a college camp@@ us .
Yet as she and the other eigh@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders in the group explo@@ red G@@ ett@@ ys@@ burg , where the tu@@ ition runs $ 3@@ 8,@@ 6@@ 90 a year , their attitude was less that of a@@ we@@ struck visitors than of enthusiastic prospec@@ tive students .
Yes ! This is where I &apos;ll be ! exc@@ laimed Gra@@ ci@@ ela , who would like to study medicine , when the guide announced that they &apos;d entered the science building .
Wo@@ w , really ? she said thou@@ ght@@ fully , when told of the school &apos;s low prof@@ ess@@ or-@@ to-@@ student ratio .
The P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania college was the sevent@@ h the kids had visited on their three-@@ day tour , and by now they had completely absor@@ bed its intended message : The question is not whether you &apos;re going to college .
The question is where .
Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.@@ S.@@ -@@ born children of His@@ pan@@ ic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregn@@ ant as teen@@ agers , there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educ@@ ations they need to enter the middle class .
In fact , one in five of these &quot; second-@@ generation &quot; His@@ pan@@ ics gradu@@ ates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their imm@@ igrant parents , mostly Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Central Americans , entered the United States without finishing high school .
Their success stories are important , researchers say , because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an out@@ size role in the country &apos;s workforce .
Those who study high achie@@ vers say they often have a natural aff@@ inity for school and an inn@@ ate drive to succeed .
Many also have parents who set lo@@ f@@ ty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their un@@ famili@@ arity with American schools .
But ment@@ oring programs also can play an enormous role in helping Gra@@ ci@@ ela and millions of children like her make it to college -- particularly if those efforts are sustained over time .
When you &apos;re looking at low-@@ income kids whose parents don &apos;t have the experience and the skills to help them navi@@ gate through the system , any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it , said Patri@@ cia G@@ án@@ dar@@ a , a resear@@ cher at the University of California , Dav@@ is , who has studied Lat@@ ino students .
We need to think about providing a suppor@@ tive network for these kids from pre@@ school all the way on through high school .
The federal program that funded Gra@@ ci@@ ela &apos;s college tour is a useful example .
Kno@@ wn as G@@ E@@ AR UP , it provides more than $ 300 million a year to local school systems to run college pre@@ p programs that begin when low-@@ income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school .
Since 1999 , the program has served more than 10 million students , with more than 60 percent going on to college , according to the U.S. Department of Education .
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability , the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to re@@ build its ailing infrastructure during two au@@ ctions that concluded Saturday .
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China , Russia and European oil firms are po@@ ised to play a major role in refurb@@ ishing Iraq &apos;s oil industry , crip@@ pled by decades of war and sanctions .
American companies wal@@ ked away with st@@ akes in just two of the 10 au@@ c@@ tioned fields .
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction , which began Friday .
The only one that submitted a bid lost .
Two American companies reached deals for fields au@@ c@@ tioned in June .
The me@@ ager representation of American oil gi@@ ants in Iraq &apos;s opening oil industry surprised an@@ alyst@@ s .
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war , and instead of U.S. companies , you have Asi@@ ans and Europeans leading the way , said Rub@@ a Hus@@ ari , the editor of Iraq Oil Forum , an online news out@@ let .
It will be a long time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq .
Conc@@ ern@@ s over security , under@@ sco@@ red by massive coordinated bom@@ b@@ ings Tuesday , and political instability as the U.S. military with@@ draws , likely kept American oil companies from vent@@ uring more for@@ ce@@ fully in Iraq , which has the world &apos;s third-@@ largest proven cru@@ de reserves , an@@ alyst@@ s said .
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because ri@@ vals , particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms , have mark@@ edly lower labor costs and are more pr@@ one to take risks because they don &apos;t respond to shareholders .
Ex@@ x@@ on-@@ Mob@@ il and Oc@@ ci@@ dental Pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the mini@@ stry .
Major U.S. firms such as Che@@ v@@ ron and Con@@ o@@ co@@ Phil@@ li@@ ps , which have cultiv@@ ated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years , wal@@ ked away emp@@ ty-@@ handed .
Russian companies Lu@@ ko@@ il and Gaz@@ pro@@ m were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend .
Stat@@ e-@@ owned Chinese National Pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um Cor@@ p@@ . bid on more contracts than any other company and wal@@ ked away with large st@@ akes in contracts for two major fields .
We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power , Oil Ministry spo@@ kes@@ man As@@ sam Ji@@ had said .
We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq .
Companies pre-@@ selected to submit bi@@ ds made offers that were then compared to the per bar@@ rel fee the mini@@ stry was willing to pay for boo@@ sting output above current levels at each field .
Top al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da plann@@ er apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missi@@ le strike along Pakistan &apos;s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da operations plann@@ er this week , U.S. counter@@ terrorism officials said Friday .
If confirmed , this would be the second dead@@ ly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall .
Sal@@ e@@ h al@@ -S@@ om@@ ali was one of two Arab men thought to have been killed when a pair of missi@@ les t@@ ore into their car Tuesday near the town of Mi@@ ran Sha@@ h in North Wa@@ zi@@ rist@@ an province , according to U.S. sources and Pakist@@ ani officials in the region .
Local authorities said the missi@@ les were fi@@ red by an un@@ man@@ ned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan &apos;s law@@ less tri@@ bal belt .
They were driving in a white car , heading toward the Afghan border , when the car was hit , said an official with Pakistan &apos;s civilian intelligence agency , speaking by phone from Mi@@ ran Sha@@ h .
The official said suspec@@ ted local milit@@ ants rus@@ hed to the spot and quickly conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated what remained of the &quot; totally demo@@ li@@ shed bodies . &quot;
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims &apos; identi@@ ties , but two U.S. counter@@ terrorism officials c@@ ited un@@ specified evidence that Som@@ ali was among the dead .
Som@@ ali was described as a senior al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da military plann@@ er who ran the terrorist group &apos;s operations outside the Afghan@@ ist@@ an-@@ Pakistan region .
He was engaged in p@@ lot@@ ting throughout the world , said one senior official , who spoke on the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity , c@@ iting the sensitive nature of U.S. air@@ strikes inside Pakist@@ ani territory .
Given his central role , this probably included p@@ lot@@ ting attacks against the United States and Europe .
He took strategic guidance from al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da &apos;s top leadership and translated it into operational blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ ts for prospec@@ tive terrorist attacks .
The second U.S. official said Som@@ ali had risen quickly through al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da &apos;s ranks and was well-@@ connected with other extrem@@ ist groups in the region .
He may not be a household name to some Americans , but that in no way dimin@@ ishes the threat he posed to us and our allies , the second official said .
If his death is confirmed , Som@@ ali would be the second senior al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da or Taliban leader killed since September , when a similar strike killed Na@@ j@@ mu@@ d@@ din J@@ al@@ olo@@ v , the leader of a milit@@ ant fac@@ tion in the tri@@ bal belt , and three other top oper@@ atives .
The temp@@ o of strikes by CI@@ A-@@ run d@@ ron@@ es has dec@@ lined since the summer , from an average of about six operations per month to two , according to a t@@ ally by the Long War Journal , a Web site managed by a non@@ profit group .
The decline may be due to improved tac@@ tics by terrorist groups , which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ru@@ th@@ lessly killing suspec@@ ted inform@@ ants , the site said .
Top U.@@ N@@ . en@@ voy in Kab@@ ul to step down
The United Nations &apos; top en@@ voy in Afghanistan , Ka@@ i Ei@@ de , said Friday that he would step down from his post in March , ending a tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ten@@ ure that was mar@@ red by alleg@@ ations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan &apos;s U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ backed presidential election .
Ei@@ de &apos;s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30@@ ,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
The U.@@ N@@ . en@@ voy said that he supports the sur@@ ge but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a military draw@@ down beginning in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces .
We need to accelerate the buil@@ du@@ p of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afgh@@ ans that they can trust the international community , Ei@@ de said in a telephone interview from Kab@@ ul .
The commitment has to be long-term .
The Norwe@@ gian diplom@@ at also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants ai@@ ding Afghanistan &apos;s political transition .
The sur@@ ge on the military side has to be copied on the civilian side , he said .
Ei@@ de said he was not re@@ signing but simply fulfilling a commitment he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kab@@ ul .
He said he wanted to serve notice to U.@@ N .
Secretary General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon now so that he would have time to find a replacement .
What I &apos;ve said is that you better start looking for a successor , Ei@@ de said .
When I came here , there was a two-@@ month vacuum between a departure of my predecessor and my arrival .
B@@ an has begun searching for a replacement , according to U.@@ N@@ . officials .
The officials say he has been considering St@@ aff@@ an di Mist@@ ura , a Swe@@ di@@ sh-@@ Italian national who recently headed the U.@@ N@@ . mission in Bag@@ h@@ dad , and Jean-@@ Marie Gu@@ é@@ hen@@ no , a Fren@@ ch@@ man who previously led U.@@ N@@ . peace@@ keeping operations .
Ei@@ de &apos;s standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former dep@@ uty , Peter W. Gal@@ bra@@ ith , accused him in September of favor@@ ing President Ham@@ id Kar@@ z@@ ai in the country &apos;s presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud .
Ei@@ de denied the alleg@@ ations , but he said the accus@@ ations by Gal@@ bra@@ ith -- who was fi@@ red -- &quot; certainly damaged the mission , because there was already a great degree of skep@@ ticism with regard to international interference &quot; in the election .
Ei@@ de said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.@@ S.@@ -@@ led forces in Afghanistan .
He also urged the U.@@ N@@ . leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that don@@ ate to the Afghan mission , saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly spent .
Ei@@ de expressed fru@@ stration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan , saying that cum@@ ber@@ some U.@@ N@@ . hi@@ ring regulations under@@ cut his ability to bring in talent .
The U.@@ N@@ . rules are such that I have only been able to recru@@ it a single person since May , he said .
That is catastrop@@ hi@@ c and can &apos;t continue .
Gates : Iran to face additional sanctions
Def@@ ense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose &quot; significant additional sanctions &quot; on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions .
Gates , speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week@@ -@@ long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic re@@ public .
There are no good options in Iran , he said , in response to a query from a soldi@@ er about the li@@ ke@@ lihood of such a development . ¨
One of the things that weigh@@ s on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years , &#91; it &#93; is the inherent un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability of war .
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran &apos;s military and political elite , but Gates sign@@ aled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iran@@ ians .
He said that &quot; a package of incentives and dis@@ incentives &quot; would be needed &quot; to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons &quot; because &quot; their people will suffer enor@@ m@@ ously &quot; from sanctions .
In a statement Friday by White House spo@@ kes@@ man Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs , the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &quot; credible &quot; consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.@@ N@@ . Security Council and its nuclear wat@@ ch@@ dog , the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency .
Iran insi@@ sts that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes .
In talks in Geneva on Oc@@ t@@ . 1 , it indicated that it would return to talks on restra@@ ining its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial portion of its stock@@ pi@@ le of enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium in exchange for desper@@ ately needed fuel for a medical research re@@ actor .
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations .
But since then , Iran appears to have wal@@ ked away from the tent@@ ative deals -- in part , experts say , because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States .
Frank@@ ly , Iran &apos;s sti@@ ff@@ ing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October , I think , has brought the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iran@@ ians , Gates said .
President Obama has set a Dec@@ . 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he turns to re@@ viewing other options , including pursuing what Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Ro@@ d@@ ham Clinton once called &quot; crip@@ pling sanctions . &quot;
In a statement issued in New York , Iran &apos;s mission to the United Nations den@@ ounced what it called &quot; bas@@ eless and un@@ founded alleg@@ ations &quot; Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran &apos;s nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers &quot; in order to achieve an appropriate , long-term solution . &quot;
Gates , who was to return to Washington late Friday , met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki before flying to Iraq &apos;s o@@ il-@@ rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kir@@ ku@@ k and Kurdish officials in Ir@@ bi@@ l .
Ten@@ sions remain high between the Kur@@ ds and Iraq &apos;s Arab majority , particularly over boundaries , property rights and re@@ ven@@ u@@ e-@@ sharing .
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in U.S. plans to cut the number of American troops from 1@@ 15@@ ,000 to 50@@ ,000 by the end of August .
Gates also sought to al@@ lay Kurdish anxi@@ ety about the pending draw@@ down . U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Mass@@ ou@@ d Bar@@ z@@ ani , president of the Kur@@ dist@@ an Regional Government : &quot; We will preserve your security , prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq .
We will not abandon you . &quot;
In aging China , a change of course
W@@ ang Wei@@ j@@ ia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda post@@ ers lec@@ turing them that &quot; M@@ other Earth is too tired to sustain more children &quot; and &quot; One more baby means one more tom@@ b . &quot;
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials , al@@ armed by their city &apos;s low birth@@ rate and aging population , ab@@ rup@@ tly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child , their reaction was instant and firm : No way .
We have already given all our time and energy for just one child .
We have none left for a second , said W@@ ang , 31 , a human resources administrator with an 8-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old son .
More than 30 years after China &apos;s one-@@ child policy was introduced , creating two generations of not@@ ori@@ ously ch@@ ub@@ by , spo@@ iled only children affec@@ tion@@ ately nick@@ named &quot; little em@@ per@@ ors , &quot; a population crisis is lo@@ oming in the country .
The average birth@@ rate has pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed to 1.@@ 8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect , according to the U.@@ N .
Pop@@ ulation Division , while the number of residents 60 and older is predic@@ ted to explo@@ de from 16.@@ 7 percent of the population in 2020 to 3@@ 1.1 percent by 2050 . That is far above the global average of about 20 percent .
The im@@ balance is worse in weal@@ thy coastal cities with highly educated populations , such as Shanghai .
Last year , people 60 and older accoun@@ ted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai &apos;s registered residents , while the birth@@ rate was less than one child per couple .
X@@ ie L@@ ing@@ li , director of the Shanghai Municip@@ al Pop@@ ulation and Family Plan@@ ning Commission , has said that fer@@ tile couples need to have bab@@ ies to &quot; help reduce the proportion of the aging population and allevi@@ ate a workforce shortage in the future . &quot;
Shanghai is about to be &quot; as old -- not as rich , though -- as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden , &quot; she said .
A gradual eas@@ ing
Written into the country &apos;s constitution in 1978 , China &apos;s one-@@ child policy is argu@@ ably the most controversial mandate introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date .
Cou@@ ples who viol@@ ate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual sal@@ ary in some areas -- and discrimination at work .
Chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical stra@@ in on its natural resources , while human rights advocates have den@@ ounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy .
In rural areas , some officials have forced women pregn@@ ant with a second child to under@@ go abor@@ tions .
In addition , many couples have had sex@@ -@@ selec@@ tive abor@@ tions , leading to an un@@ naturally high mal@@ e-@@ to-@@ female ratio .
In recent years , population officials have gradually sof@@ tened their stance on the one-@@ child policy .
In 2004 , they allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007 , they t@@ oned down many of their hard-@@ line slo@@ gans .
Q@@ i@@ ao X@@ i@@ ao@@ ch@@ un , a professor at the Institute of Pop@@ ulation Research at Peking University , said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes , such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child .
In July , Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more bir@@ ths .
Almost overnight , post@@ ers direc@@ ting families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations deta@@ iling who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit .
The city government dispat@@ ched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and sli@@ p le@@ af@@ lets under doors .
It has also ple@@ dged to provide emotional and financial coun@@ sel@@ ing to those elec@@ ting to have more than one child .
The response has been under@@ whel@@ ming , family planning officials say .
Dis@@ appointing response
Although officials in one rural town on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Shanghai say they saw an up@@ tick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched , the more urban districts report no change .
Hu@@ in@@ an to@@ wn@@ ship , with a population of 1@@ 15@@ ,000 , for instance , is still receiving just four to five applications a month .
Dis@@ appointed Shanghai officials say that , despite the campaign , the number of bir@@ ths in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 16@@ 5,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008 .
Fen@@ g Ju@@ ying , head of the family planning committee in Shanghai &apos;s Ca@@ ol@@ u to@@ wn@@ ship , said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don &apos;t want more children .
They want to give the best to their first , she said .
Y@@ ang Ji@@ a@@ wei , 27 , and his wife , Li@@ u Ju@@ an@@ ju@@ an , 26 , said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so .
But like many Chinese , they have only the sc@@ ant medical and life insurance provided by the government .
Without a social safety net , they say , the choice would be irresponsible .
People in the West wron@@ g@@ ly see the one-@@ child policy as a rights issue , said Y@@ ang , a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregn@@ ant with the couple &apos;s first child .
Yes , we are being rob@@ bed of the chance to have more than one child .
But the problem is not just some policy .
It is money .
Other couples c@@ ite psychological reasons for hesit@@ ating .
W@@ ang , the human resources administrator , said she wants an only child because she was one herself : &quot; We were at the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us .
We are not used to taking care of and don &apos;t really want to take care of others . &quot;
Ch@@ en Zi@@ j@@ ian , a 4@@ 2-@@ year-old who own@@ s a translation company , put it more bl@@ un@@ tly .
For the du@@ al-@@ career , mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class parents who are bringing the birth@@ rate down , he said , it &apos;s about being successful enough to be sel@@ fish .
Today &apos;s 20@@ - and 30-@@ some@@ things grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China &apos;s experiment with capitalism and don &apos;t want that kind of life for themselves , he said .
Even one child makes huge demands on parents &apos; time , he said .
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life .
Then there are the space issues -- &quot; You have to re@@ model your apartment &quot; -- and the strategi@@ zing -- &quot; You have to have a ré@@ sum@@ é ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best pre@@ schools . &quot;
Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once , Ch@@ en said , but not twice .
O@@ urs is the first generation with higher living standards , he said .
We do not want to make too many sacri@@ fi@@ ces .
U.@@ N@@ . group dra@@ fts plan to reduce emissions
The U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ spon@@ sored climate conference -- characterized so far by un@@ ru@@ ly post@@ uring and mutual rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document out@@ lining ambitious green@@ hou@@ se-@@ gas reductions over the next 40 years , with industri@@ alized nations shoul@@ dering most of the burden in the near term .
The text , which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases , highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illumin@@ ated a path forward .
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time , with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week .
For@@ ged by a U.@@ N@@ . ad-@@ hoc working group , the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term .
And it provides a range of options for the key questions , including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output , and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to toler@@ ate .
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process , said John Co@@ equ@@ y@@ t , senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club .
Michael Z@@ am@@ mit C@@ ut@@ aj@@ ar , who drafted the six-@@ page document , bo@@ iled down a 18@@ 0-@@ page negotiation text to focus on what the U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s top climate official , Y@@ vo de Bo@@ er , described as &quot; the big picture . &quot;
It shows the out@@ lines for a possible deal , in which industrial nations would collec@@ tively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels , while major developing countries would reduce thei@@ rs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent .
Together , the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050 .
The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by ple@@ dging to provide $ 3.@@ 6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from cop@@ ing with flood and d@@ rought to avoiding de@@ fore@@ station .
Still , Friday featured the same sort of verb@@ al fire@@ works that have dominated the talks for the past week .
U.S. special climate en@@ voy To@@ d@@ d Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of green@@ hou@@ se-@@ gas emissions for industri@@ alized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world .
The move sign@@ aled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago .
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries step@@ ping up and taking action , said Stern , who also compla@@ ined that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers .
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Y@@ af@@ ei said America &apos;s top climate negoti@@ ator was either lacking &quot; common sense &quot; or being &quot; extremely irresponsible &quot; for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming .
With the future economic tra@@ jec@@ tory of the world &apos;s major powers at stake , fault lines have erup@@ ted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies .
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet , with China and the United States feu@@ ding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world &apos;s two do@@ zen most influential countries are ignor@@ ing the scientific imperative to take b@@ older action .
Ric@@ ardo U@@ late , a Costa R@@ ican deleg@@ ate , said it &apos;s not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for cur@@ bing greenhouse gases , even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emit@@ ters accountable for their actions .
This is clearly a game where a new economic he@@ gemon@@ y is being developed , said U@@ late , who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adv@@ iser for Con@@ servation International .
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen , although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best .
The Alliance of Small Island States , which has 43 members , produced a 24-@@ page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning .
Ar@@ tur Run@@ ge-@@ M@@ etz@@ ger , who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission , said the push by small island nations has &quot; put political pressure on the entire political process , &quot; in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India .
The talks took on new urgency as deleg@@ ates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal .
High-@@ level officials such as Indian environment minister J@@ ai@@ ra@@ m Ram@@ es@@ h and the Chinese vice minister step@@ ped off planes and ra@@ ced through the B@@ ella Center &apos;s halls to clo@@ se@@ d-@@ door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbit@@ rated over the next week .
The she@@ er spra@@ w@@ l of the gathering -- where 13@@ ,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , gu@@ itar@@ -@@ playing activists put on ni@@ gh@@ tly shows mo@@ cking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-@@ to-@@ hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .
The intensity is only building : nearly all of the key ministers are now here , and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen .
We &apos;re getting into the big le@@ ag@@ ues , said Carlos Manuel Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , vice president for global policy at Con@@ servation International .
The heav@@ y@@ wei@@ ghts are coming .
Britain ’ s first 14@@ 0@@ mp@@ h train to re@@ define that Monday feeling
At 5.@@ 13 on Monday morning a whi@@ stle will p@@ ier@@ ce the dark@@ ness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain .
The first high-speed comm@@ uter train in the country will reach 14@@ 0@@ mp@@ h as it stre@@ aks from Ash@@ ford , K@@ ent , to London St P@@ anc@@ ras , covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes .
Lord Ad@@ on@@ is , the Transport Secretary , will then be joined by Dame Kel@@ ly Hol@@ mes aboard the first Jav@@ e@@ lin comm@@ uter service out of London .
He hopes that the new service will eventually plug Britain into an international network of fast , reliable trains and connect the great con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations of the Mid@@ lands , the North and Scotland to London .
Neg@@ le@@ cted back@@ waters would become thri@@ ving comm@@ uter towns , business travel times would be s@@ las@@ hed and the shift from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions as well as eas@@ ing con@@ gestion on the roads .
In theory , the three main political parties buy into this vision .
But the tens of billions of po@@ unds needed to build a new national rail network , the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental harm may yet put the bra@@ kes on Britain ’ s high-speed lines .
High Speed Two ( H@@ S@@ 2 ) , a company created in January to provide the Government with a fea@@ sibility study , will hand its report to Lord Ad@@ on@@ is on December 30 , The Times has learnt .
It will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network .
The new line linking London to the West Mid@@ lands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the environmental impact may be con@@ ten@@ tious .
In open country , the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route .
H@@ S@@ 2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network running north .
Lord Ad@@ on@@ is will respond in the spring .
The favoured option being put forward is a Y@@ -@@ shaped configuration in which a single high-speed line would run up to the West Mid@@ lands .
The line would split at or near Birmingham , with one branch running west of the P@@ enn@@ ines to Manchester and Scotland and another running nor@@ theast to Sh@@ eff@@ iel@@ d , Le@@ eds and New@@ castle upon Ty@@ ne .
A single line would run into Scotland .
&quot; It looks like it is going to be the best-@@ performing option , &quot; a railway insi@@ der said .
Once complete , journey times between London and Edinburgh would be cut to 2 hours 40 minutes .
The first leg , which would not open before 20@@ 25 , would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes , compared with just over an hour at present .
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 25@@ 0@@ mp@@ h , making the British network the fastest in Europe .
The initial track is being designed to take trains 400@@ m in length capable of carrying 1,@@ 100 people .
As many as 18 could operate each hour on a Lon@@ d@@ on-@@ Birmingham line .
That means that a London terminal capable of handling 20@@ ,000 passengers an hour would be needed .
Given space constraints in the capital , it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network .
Rail industry experts say that only St P@@ anc@@ ras International or Eu@@ ston offer that potential .
Lord Ad@@ on@@ is will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should proceed , but lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a general election .
Even if he does put the wheels in motion , the network would have to be built in sections .
Tra@@ ins would at first be forced to run off high-speed lines on to the existing ra@@ ils north of Birmingham , keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours .
That is seen as the crucial ti@@ pping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains , a bench@@ mark for the rail revolution .
Ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers meet mort@@ gage on T@@ ory &apos;s £ 7@@ 5,000 or@@ an@@ gery
Alan Dun@@ can , the fron@@ t@@ ben@@ ch T@@ ory M@@ P , charged the taxpa@@ yer thousands of po@@ unds a year towards the cost of an or@@ an@@ gery he built at his constituency home .
The party ’ s pris@@ ons spo@@ kes@@ man , who was dem@@ oted by David Cam@@ eron for compla@@ ining that MP@@ s were living &quot; on rations &quot; , increased his mort@@ gage by £ 7@@ 5,000 to build an o@@ ak@@ -@@ fra@@ med extension to his second home in R@@ ut@@ land .
He was allowed to charge the extra interest , tot@@ alling hundreds of po@@ unds a month , to the taxpa@@ yer .
The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been qu@@ eri@@ ed by Sir Thomas Leg@@ g , who is conducting a review of members ’ expenses . Last night Mr Dun@@ can said the claims &quot; couldn ’ t be clean@@ er or simpler &quot; .
Mr Dun@@ can , one of the rich@@ est Members of Parliament , own@@ s a two-@@ sto@@ rey house in a village in his R@@ ut@@ land and Mel@@ ton constituency .
Hou@@ ses near by have sold for almost a million po@@ unds .
The ground floor comprises a kitchen , living room and dining room , but the fees office agreed that Mr Dun@@ can needed more space .
Last year he added a con@@ servatory to the house , described in plans as an &quot; or@@ an@@ gery &quot; .
Neigh@@ b@@ ours described it as a &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse for enter@@ taining &quot; .
Mr Dun@@ can was not required to make any reference to the increased borro@@ wing during a recent investigation by the Commons ’ Standards and Privi@@ leg@@ es Committee into his previous mort@@ gage ar@@ ange@@ ments .
The committee cle@@ ared him last month of bre@@ aching the rules after an investigation into his expenses .
In 2004 Mr Dun@@ can changed the legal security for a £ 27@@ 1,@@ 4@@ 06 mort@@ gage from his London property to his constituency home , which he had bought in 1991 , the year before he became an M@@ P .
Docum@@ ents released this week show that Mr Dun@@ can was claiming about £ 1,@@ 400 a month in mort@@ gage interest until March last year .
In April , his claims increased to more than £ 1,@@ 800 a month .
The interest rate on Mr Dun@@ can ’ s R@@ BS mort@@ gage did not change in that time , sugge@@ sting that all the increase was to fund the £ 7@@ 5,000 borro@@ wing .
The R@@ BS standard variable mort@@ gage rate went down from 7.@@ 94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year , where it remains .
The latest document release by the Commons authorities show that Mr Dun@@ can was continuing to claim £ 1,@@ 250 a month this May .
Mr Dun@@ can lost his job as Sha@@ dow Le@@ ader of the House in September after an under@@ cover re@@ porter fil@@ med him saying that MP@@ s had to survive &quot; on rations &quot; after the expenses scandal .
&quot; Basi@@ cally , it ’ s being nation@@ alised , you have to live on rations and are treated like s * * t . &quot;
He said : &quot; I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fra@@ ction based on what is proper .
And I could claim the whole bloo@@ dy lot , but I don ’ t . &quot;
The M@@ P , a milli@@ on@@ aire from his former career as an oil tra@@ der , was first challeng@@ ed over his expenses in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of po@@ unds for his garden , before agre@@ eing with the fees office that this &quot; could be considered excessive &quot; .
An activ@@ ist du@@ g a hole in the shape of a po@@ und sign in Mr Dun@@ can ’ s la@@ wn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £ 4@@ ,000 over three years .
A@@ sk@@ ed about the increased mort@@ gage last night , Mr Dun@@ can said : &quot; It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by Leg@@ g . &quot;
He added : &quot; There is no issue of du@@ cking and we@@ aving or pushing the rules or anything .
It is absolutely straight down the line , within the rules , authorised and everything .
It just couldn ’ t in many ways be clean@@ er or simpler . &quot;
Come all ye fai@@ thful to see Bri@@ gh@@ ton ’ s beach h@@ ut Ad@@ vent calendar
Beach hu@@ ts in Bri@@ gh@@ ton have found a new lease of life for the winter months as an interactive Ad@@ vent calendar .
Beyond , an alternative church group that encourages spiritual expl@@ oration through creativity , invited 24 owners to decor@@ ate their hu@@ ts for each day in December , using Christmas car@@ ols as their theme .
The event started on December 1 , with visitors allowed to view the latest h@@ ut from 5.@@ 30@@ pm to 6.@@ 30@@ pm each day , with min@@ ce p@@ ies and mul@@ led wine laid on for free .
Car@@ ols chosen so far include I Sa@@ w Three Shi@@ ps , O Come , O Come , Em@@ manu@@ el and The First No@@ ë@@ l , where the h@@ ut features the work of Jan@@ ette To@@ zer , a local artist .
Martin Po@@ ole , 50 , a TV marketing assi@@ stant from Ho@@ ve , is a non-@@ sti@@ pen@@ di@@ ary cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man within the Ch@@ ich@@ ester dio@@ c@@ ese and the leader of Beyond .
He said : &quot; We want to make religion more relevant to people in a post-@@ Ch@@ risten@@ dom society .
&quot; Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building ? It ’ s my feeling the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways .
&quot; The idea of the beach h@@ ut Ad@@ vent calendar began just as a conversation with some friends over dinner .
Bri@@ gh@@ ton is such a fantas@@ tically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent that through spiritu@@ ality . &quot;
Large climate change gather@@ ings in Copenhagen and around the world
T@@ ens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive agreement in the fight against global warming around the world and in Copenhagen , where police made several hundred arre@@ sts .
At least thirty thousand people , according to police , and a hundred thousand , according to the organis@@ ers , mar@@ ched in the cold in the Danish capital outside the United Nations climate conference , which is t@@ asked with reaching an agreement by Friday that will enter into effect on the 1st of January , 2013 .
For Con@@ nie He@@ de@@ ga@@ ard , the Danish climate conference president , the increasing number of climate r@@ allies around the world , illustr@@ ated by these protests , has contributed to making the &apos; political cost &apos; of a failure in Copenhagen very high .
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the main proc@@ ession , when a group of 300 prote@@ sters , clo@@ th@@ ed entirely in black , broke shop windows with p@@ aving and h@@ amm@@ ers , observed a re@@ porter from the AF@@ P .
Ri@@ ot police provided an immediate and un@@ hesit@@ ant response .
Police announced a total of 600 to 700 hundred arre@@ sts , with most , they report , being members of the &apos; Black Blo@@ cks &apos; ; small ultra-@@ violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg , in the East of France , in April .
The Climate Justice Action ( C@@ J@@ A ) coalition , one of the protest organis@@ ers , reported conditions whereby hundreds of prote@@ sters were arrested &quot; without discrimination , &quot; highlighting that a hundred of them &quot; were still de@@ tained in the street on Saturday night &quot; hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold &quot; .
Having left the Parliament , the proc@@ ession headed in an or@@ derly fashion towards the B@@ ella Center , where negotiations were to take place .
The prote@@ sters stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter .
A stage had been raised to receive the expected speakers before a cand@@ le@@ lit vi@@ gi@@ l , in which the former South African Arch@@ bis@@ hop from Cape Town , Des@@ mond Tut@@ u would be taking part .
The majority of prote@@ sters had arrived by coach and train from the major European cities , but many Asian prote@@ sters , including some Chinese and Korean , were also present , as well as those from Africa .
Around 3000 people , mainly cla@@ d in sky blue rain@@ co@@ ats , had formed an initial rally in Copenhagen during the morning , called by Friends of the Earth , who were planning &quot; blue waves &quot; for &quot; climate justice &quot; .
We are mar@@ ching on the streets today to demand repar@@ ations of the ecological debt for the South , explained Li@@ dy N@@ ac@@ p@@ il , a Fili@@ p@@ ino activ@@ ist in the Jub@@ ile@@ e South Co@@ alition in Copenhagen .
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left , ass@@ esses the singer from Ben@@ in , Ange@@ li@@ que K@@ id@@ jo .
There are rivers dr@@ ying out in Africa ; water courses , where it is possible to walk and never was before .
For the first time in the history of Climate Diplom@@ acy , born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention , the anti-@@ globalisation movement has brought itself closer to environmental organisations .
The French Euro@@ dep@@ uty , José Bo@@ v@@ é , a face of anti-@@ globalisation , explained that he has come to Copenhagen to &quot; connect climate justice with social justice &quot; : &quot; Today there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the anti-@@ globalisation fight . &quot;
The Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific region , which is home to numerous islands , which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming , had ki@@ cked off the protests .
According to organis@@ ers , some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia .
In Man@@ ila , several hundred people , mostly students , par@@ aded in red , bran@@ di@@ shing bann@@ ers about the benefits of solar energy .
In Hong Kong , D@@ j@@ ak@@ arta , and in Canada , r@@ allies of several hundred demonstr@@ ators were also formed to demand more for@@ ceful action against climate change .
In France , the protests organised by the &quot; 350 &quot; network brought together several hundred people , notably in Paris , Mar@@ sei@@ l@@ les ( in the South ) , L@@ ille ( in the North ) , Bor@@ deaux ( in the West ) , and Lyon ( in the East ) .
In Geneva , doz@@ ens of people gathered .
Se@@ par@@ ati@@ st Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia has elected its president ; Georgia calls it a &quot; far@@ ce &quot;
Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia elected its president on Saturday , a little over a year after Moscow &apos;s recognition of the pro-@@ Russian region of Georgia , while T@@ bili@@ si calls it a &quot; far@@ ce &quot; .
Some 13@@ 1 000 people were called on to take part in this first vote following the Georgi@@ a-@@ Russia war in August 2008 for the control of South O@@ sse@@ tia , another sec@@ ession@@ ist Georgi@@ an territory recognised by Russia .
The poll@@ ing stations closed at 17 : 00 GM@@ T .
At@@ ten@@ dance was at 58 % a few hours before closure , according to Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an electoral Commission officials .
The first provi@@ sional results were to be announced during the night between Saturday and Sunday .
The five candidates in the running , among whom the existing president , Ser@@ ge@@ i Bag@@ ap@@ sh , all categ@@ or@@ ically reject the idea of a re@@ unification with Georgia , which has condemned the holding of the vote .
These elections are a far@@ ce .
For his part , the Georgi@@ an president , Mik@@ hei@@ l Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , &quot; regre@@ ts that Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia has fallen under total Russian occupation , &quot; declared his spo@@ kes@@ woman , Man@@ ana Man@@ j@@ gal@@ ad@@ ze .
Other than Russia , only Nicar@@ agua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the territory &apos;s 2@@ 16 000 inhabitants , while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops .
After separ@@ ating itself from Georgia in the 199@@ 2-@@ 1993 conflict , which saw the loss of several thousand lives , Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia is trying to show , by means of this election , that it is ready to join the international community .
This process is a stage in our new life , our new era as an independent state , declared Sv@@ et@@ lana K@@ v@@ arch@@ ia , a 5@@ 4-@@ year-old hist@@ orian , who confirms having voted for Mist@@ er Bag@@ ap@@ sh .
She was among the voters who came to the poll@@ ing station in an attractive white school building with several pal@@ m trees at the front in the capital , Sou@@ k@@ hou@@ mi .
The question of the Russian dom@@ ination is at the heart of the presidential debate , in this region gi@@ fted with a lush landscape on the Black Sea .
V@@ ast b@@ ill@@ boards showing Mist@@ er Bag@@ ap@@ sh beside the Russian President and Prime Minister , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev and V@@ ladimir Putin , are dot@@ ted around this small territory of 2@@ 16 000 inhabitants .
In Gal@@ i , in the West of the country , the Chief of District , Bes@@ lan Arch@@ ba , reserved a very warm welcome for the Russian officials who came to over@@ see the voting .
We , the Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an people , are than@@ k@@ ful , he said during a small ceremony , all@@ u@@ ding to the support from Moscow , and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations , rep@@ lied Alex@@ ei Ost@@ rov@@ sky , a member of the Russian Parliament , while raising his glass of vo@@ d@@ ka .
For their part , the opposition represented in the vote by the former vic@@ e-@@ president Ra@@ oul K@@ ha@@ d@@ j@@ im@@ ba and two business@@ men , Z@@ a@@ ous Ar@@ d@@ zin@@ ba and Bes@@ lan B@@ out@@ ba , critic@@ ises the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year , such as the one giving Russia control of the Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an rail network for the next 10 years .
The fifth candidate , Vit@@ ali B@@ gan@@ ba , asser@@ ts not being in support of the current Government or the opposition .
50 % plus one vote is the majority required to win the vote .
If no candidate at@@ tains this threshold , a second vote must be organised within two weeks .
Climate : demonstrations around the world , incidents in Copenhagen .
T@@ ens of thousands of people the world over mar@@ ched on Saturday to demand an ambitious and restrictive agreement at the Climate Conference in Copenhagen , where police were on alert and arrested almost 700 people on the f@@ ring@@ es of an imposing rally .
Thir@@ ty thousand people , according to police , a hundred thousand , according to organis@@ ers , par@@ aded in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital , which is receiving deleg@@ ates from 19@@ 3 countries until the 18th of December , who will be seeking to conclude an agreement to come into effect by the 1st of January , 2013 .
Having left the Parliament , the proc@@ ession headed in a generally or@@ derly fashion for the B@@ ella Center , where negotiations were to take place .
The demonstr@@ ators stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter .
A stage had been er@@ ected to accommodate the speakers , before a cand@@ le@@ lit vi@@ gi@@ l , with the participation of former South African Cape Town arch@@ bis@@ hop , Des@@ mond Tut@@ u .
A few moments after the departure of the proc@@ ession , a group of several hundred demonstr@@ ators , cla@@ d entirely in black and holding bri@@ cks and h@@ amm@@ ers , broke shop windows , re@@ marked an AF@@ P re@@ porter .
Ri@@ ot police immediately surrounded them and interven@@ ed in no uncertain terms , thro@@ wing several of them to the ground .
Police announced the arre@@ sts of 600 to 700 hundred people , adding that they were mainly members of the &apos; Black Blo@@ cks &apos; ; small ultra-@@ violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg , in the East of France , in April .
To@@ wards the end of the afternoon a poli@@ c@@ em@@ an was injured on the ja@@ w by a piece of p@@ aving and four cars were set ali@@ ght near a squ@@ at during a series of incidents , which led to the arre@@ sts of some twenty people , according to police .
We have our eye on the small extrem@@ ist groups , police spo@@ kes@@ man Hen@@ rik Jak@@ ob@@ sen warned , as the force &apos;s helicop@@ ters cir@@ c@@ led in the sky above .
The majority of demonstr@@ ators were of European origin , arriving in co@@ aches and trains from the main German cities , from London , from Amsterdam , and also from Milan .
Large numbers of Asi@@ ans , including a few Chinese and Kore@@ ans , were also present , as were some Afri@@ cans .
Around 3000 people , mainly cla@@ d in sky blue rain@@ co@@ ats , had formed an initial rally in Copenhagen during the morning called by Friends of the Earth , who were planning &quot; blue waves &quot; for &quot; climate justice &quot; .

Ox@@ f@@ am en@@ listed the help of several well-known person@@ alities , including Danish model Hel@@ ena Ch@@ risten@@ sen , and the former UN Commissioner for refugees , Mary Rob@@ inson , who were to address the crowd .
The Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific region , which is home to numerous islands , which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming , had ki@@ cked off the protests .
According to organis@@ ers , some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia .

Histor@@ y-@@ Ge@@ ography are strengthened by the secondary schools reform , according to Ch@@ at@@ el
French Education Minister , Lu@@ c Ch@@ at@@ el , declared in an interview to be published in the French Paper On Sunday ( J@@ D@@ D ) that History and Ge@@ ography were &quot; reinforced &quot; by the secondary schools reform , despite them no longer being obligatory subjects for the French technical Six@@ th Form .
From now on , first year pupils will have four hours per week , and the same programme for a common shared culture , states Mr. Ch@@ at@@ el .
According to the minister , &quot; We need to get out of this hypo@@ cris@@ y &quot; because , he says , &quot; the &apos; S &apos; course of study is no longer the science course &quot; , but &quot; more generally , it is a mag@@ net for the stronger pupils &quot; .
The &apos; ES &apos; and &apos; L &apos; courses cannot remain in@@ fer@@ ior choices behind the &apos; S &apos; course , he continues , highlighting that &quot; I have not heard many hist@@ ori@@ ans or academ@@ ics expressing indi@@ gn@@ ance at the absence of Histor@@ y-@@ Ge@@ ography in the technical Six@@ th For@@ ms either . &quot;
On Saturday , an IF@@ O@@ P ( French Public Op@@ inion Institute ) pol@@ l appearing in L &apos;@@ Human@@ ité revealed that nearly seven out of ten ( 69 % ) French people dis@@ approved of the Government project to termin@@ ate compulsory teaching of Histor@@ y-@@ Ge@@ ography in technical Six@@ th For@@ ms . Many academ@@ ics and teachers also criticised this sup@@ pression , as have the left and some right-@@ wing representatives .
On the other hand , the minister added that there was &quot; no question &quot; of eliminating the &apos; S &apos; course philosophy .
Lu@@ c Ch@@ at@@ el also defended the teachers &apos; education reforms , just as 16 organisations ( students and associations ) called for a day of protest on Tuesday to demonstrate against the project , which , in their opinion , sacri@@ fi@@ ces the educational training of future teachers .
For 2nd year Master &apos;s ( M@@ 2 ) , an entry ex@@ am focusing on the candidate &apos;s discipline will be required at the start of the year , and an acceptance ex@@ am testing their capacity to teach will be held at the end of the year , the minister explained .
Furthermore , they will cover in-@@ class plac@@ ements throughout the M@@ 2 year , and will then be in front of pupils for a year as student teachers .
If you add up all the placement work proposed before the ex@@ am you already end up with more presence in front of students , which equ@@ ates to over 300 hours , he continued .
Finally , the minister indicates that he will be putting forward &quot; the individual &apos;s right to education ; something that does not exist in national Education &quot; .
He also reaffir@@ ms the plan to abo@@ lish the school map &quot; by 2012 &quot; .
At Nor@@ male Sup@@ é@@ rie@@ ure ( one of France &apos;s top schools ) , experts have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate
Fif@@ teen minutes to talk about what is at stake at the Copenhagen summit : that was the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean J@@ ou@@ zel , vic@@ e-@@ president of the intergovernmental group of Climate Evolution experts ( G@@ I@@ EC ) invited by the E@@ col@@ e Nor@@ male Sup@@ é@@ rie@@ ure in rue d &apos;@@ Ul@@ m ( Paris ) .
Jean J@@ ou@@ zel , Nobel Peace Prize winner , inau@@ gur@@ ated the first of the conferences entitled &quot; Ern@@ est &quot; , a day composed of a series of 15-@@ minute lec@@ tures from experts , fil@@ med and open to the public , noted an AF@@ P re@@ porter .
We wanted to do something to catch people &apos;s attention and make them want to find out more , explained one of the day &apos;s organis@@ ers , 2@@ 2-@@ year-old E@@ dou@@ ard Han@@ ne@@ zo , outside the conference ; this having been named after the name given to the fish in the school &apos;s p@@ ond .
We choose around twenty lec@@ tur@@ ers among the experts in their field and the more char@@ ism@@ atic ones are selected , he added .
On the subject of global warming , &quot; we could go on for hours , but we can also cover the key objectives in a few minutes &quot; , Jean J@@ ou@@ zel told the AF@@ P , who made his presentation without notes , but with graphical ai@@ ds , to an audience of around fif@@ ty .
This is part of our scienti@@ st &apos;s role , he emphasised , hoping that listen@@ ers will remember that &quot; the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely solid scientific case &quot; .
The video foot@@ age from the conferences will be available online on the school &apos;s website starting the 15th of December .
The next &quot; Ern@@ est &quot; day is planned for February , followed by others on a b@@ im@@ on@@ thly basis .
L@@ ate payments : anger from prison guards , action planned
P@@ ris@@ on guard unions called for a &quot; general rally &quot; on Friday to demand payment of their bon@@ uses and over@@ time before the end of the year holidays , having seen it pushed into January for budgetary reasons .
F@@ O-@@ p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire ( 2nd prison guard union ) has requested that staff , who are not on duty , demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to &quot; block &quot; them , in order to &quot; ex@@ pose the the@@ ft of their earnings &quot; .
The C@@ G@@ T-@@ p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire ( 3rd union in the profession ) calls for them to &quot; unite in general , r@@ all@@ ying at the various pris@@ ons , to show a strong tur@@ n-@@ out &quot; , condemn the non-@@ payment of &quot; over@@ time , ni@@ ght-@@ shift bon@@ uses , Sunday and holiday pay &quot; in December for their work in October as &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and unacceptable &quot; .
And the first prison guard union , Union f@@ é@@ dé@@ rale autonom@@ e p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire ( U@@ F@@ AP / UN@@ SA ) , &quot; calls for general r@@ all@@ ying ( … ) to re-@@ aw@@ aken the dis@@ content and anger &quot; .
The pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary administration &apos;s Management and the Justice Ministry explain that over@@ time has increased considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget , but assu@@ res that the outstanding balances will be settled in January .
The Chan@@ cer@@ y stated near the end of the day that Mich@@ è@@ le Alli@@ ot-@@ Marie had sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month .
I am not ignor@@ ing the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system , writes the Minister of Justice in this communication .
I have asked the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary administration Management to put in place , without delay , a set of measures to ensure that this situation , caused by a poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours , does not repeat itself in the future , adds Mr@@ s. Alli@@ ot-@@ Marie .
The December pay pack@@ et will therefore be sli@@ m , except for management staff , who benefit from the so-called target and position@@ -@@ related bon@@ uses , critics the U@@ F@@ AP / UN@@ SA , saying &quot; budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse &quot; .
It is an absolute scandal , compla@@ ins the inter-@@ regional union from Mar@@ sei@@ l@@ les , announ@@ cing its decision to boy@@ cot@@ t &quot; all meetings and con@@ voc@@ ations &quot; until further notice .
Staff will not be putting in Sunday or holiday hours if the October ones are not settled in December , and the same goes for over@@ time , threatens the Rh@@ ô@@ ne-@@ Alp@@ es-@@ Au@@ ver@@ gne trade union .
At a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded , but our staff numbers are not , it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff &apos;s salaries , judges the C@@ G@@ T-@@ p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire de Bor@@ deaux .
According to the unions , the situation is not the same in all regions , with some being worse off than others .
But in any case , the balance is not there , ob@@ serves Jean-@@ Franç@@ ois For@@ get , general secre@@ tary of U@@ F@@ AP .
For Christmas , Obama says he gives &quot; nic@@ er stuff &quot; than he receives
The American President , Barack Obama , who is preparing for his first family Christmas at the White House , intim@@ ates to TV icon O@@ pra@@ h Win@@ fre@@ y that he has one simple rule when it comes to presents : &quot; I give nic@@ er stuff than I get &quot; .
In a special programme to be broadcast on the AB@@ C channel on Sunday evening , the president and his wife , Mich@@ elle , offer an insight into the way they plan to celebrate the end of year festi@@ vities in their prestigious new home .
Even B@@ o , the family &apos;s little four-@@ leg@@ ged friend , will be joining in .
Santa Cl@@ aus lo@@ ves B@@ o too , maintains Mich@@ elle Obama , adding that the dog would &quot; naturally &quot; have a present , according to the programme &apos;s advertising tra@@ iler .
And Mich@@ elle Obama fei@@ gn@@ ed indi@@ gn@@ ance , counter@@ ing her husband &apos;s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives : &quot; No way ; I gave you good gifts last year &quot; , she te@@ ased the President .
Ab@@ sol@@ utely , he had to conc@@ ede before jo@@ k@@ ingly re@@ tor@@ ting : &quot; Who gave you this ? &quot; , pointing at the First Lady &apos;s pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace .
During this h@@ our-@@ long ligh@@ t-@@ hear@@ ted programme with the famous present@@ er , who was a fer@@ vent Barack Obama suppor@@ ter during the presidential campaign , the president and his wife also rec@@ alled their favourite childhood presents .
Barack Obama remembered a ten-@@ speed bicycle , but also a bas@@ ketball that his Ken@@ yan father , whom he had rarely seen , had given him for Christmas .
I remember a time when I met my father , who had come to visit us for Christmas , and he gave me a bas@@ ketball , said the president .
It was only much later in my life that I realised that he had given me the ball .
The First Lady , for her part , rec@@ alled her d@@ oll@@ house .
I had no idea how to organise a house , so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall , rather than arran@@ ging them around the fireplace , but I ado@@ red that little d@@ oll@@ house , said Mich@@ elle Obama .
John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day re-@@ operated on , RT@@ L claims he is in artificial com@@ a
John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day was re-@@ operated on in Los Angeles due to significant &quot; le@@ sions &quot; after an operation in France , but the situation is &quot; under control &quot; according to his ent@@ ou@@ rage , while RT@@ L claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial com@@ a to avoid pain and complic@@ ations .
The 6@@ 6-@@ year-old ro@@ cker was re-@@ operated on in the night between Wednesday and Thursday at the Ce@@ dar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted &quot; le@@ sions resulting from the operation &quot; for the sli@@ pped disc under@@ gone in Paris on November 26@@ th , his press office announced in Paris , adding that the le@@ sions had &quot; warran@@ ted a repair operation &quot; .
The singer &apos;s press office , however , wanted to be re@@ ass@@ uring , stating that the situation was &quot; under control &quot; , while announ@@ cing that a new medical bul@@ le@@ tin would be communic@@ ated within 48 hours .
According to RT@@ L , partner for the singer &apos;s first tour , however , John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day may have been put into an artificial com@@ a to avoid &quot; pain and complic@@ ations &quot; .
It will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient , once he has at least one eye open , added RT@@ L .
When ques@@ tioned by the AF@@ P , the press office neither confirmed , nor comm@@ ented on the information .
RT@@ L also claims that &quot; according to certain sources &quot; , no dra@@ in was fitted after the first operation in Paris .
The ro@@ cker had been operated on for a sli@@ pped disc at the international clin@@ ic at Parc Mon@@ ce@@ au .
The operation , scheduled several days in advance , had been carried out by the neu@@ ro-@@ sur@@ ge@@ on St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x , a well-known doctor in artist circles .
He was not available to comment on RT@@ L &apos;s information on Thursday evening .
Following the operation that he carried out on John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day , the singer was taken on Monday to the Ce@@ dar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital for an infection stem@@ ming from the operation .
The singer , Ed@@ dy Mitch@@ ell , a close friend of John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day , said on RT@@ L on Thursday that his friend was going through &quot; a bad patch &quot; , but assured everyone that he had &quot; no wor@@ ries &quot; about the ro@@ cker , who is a &quot; figh@@ ter &quot; .
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles , and I told him that it was cra@@ zy , because taking a 12-@@ hour flight after that kind of operation is not realistic , said Ed@@ dy Mitch@@ ell .
Wednesday evening , the singer &apos;s producer , Jean-@@ Claude Cam@@ us , had wanted to be re@@ ass@@ uring , stating that John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day &quot; was re@@ acting satisfac@@ tori@@ ly to the antibio@@ tics &quot; and that the infection was being &quot; contained &quot; .
Mr. Cam@@ us had also said to have spoken with La@@ e@@ ti@@ cia , the singer &apos;s wife , and not to have noticed any signs of worry .
But health problems for the singer have only multi@@ p@@ lied since he was hosp@@ itali@@ sed for nine days in July after a fall on his yacht .
Two months later , to the surprise of all , John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day had revealed having had a &quot; minor col@@ onic cancer &quot; operation , then a slight infection .
At the end of September , the singer resumed as planned his long &quot; Tour 66 &quot; , b@@ illed as his final good@@ by@@ e tour .
However , since then , every health problem is heavily comm@@ ented on . Fans and re@@ por@@ ters have noticed the singer &apos;s trouble in moving around on stage .
In mid-@@ November , his ent@@ ou@@ rage even had to deny further hospit@@ alisation .
Euro-@@ 2009 / short course : B@@ ous@@ quet &apos;s first in his lucky distance
The Fren@@ ch@@ man , Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ri@@ ck B@@ ous@@ quet , triple me@@ d@@ al-@@ holder in the long course 2009 World Championship , pul@@ led off an international title for a distance he particularly fav@@ ours , the 50@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle , at the Euro-@@ 2009 short course event in Istanbul on Thursday .
The first day of this competition , where full-@@ length swi@@ m@@ suits are permitted for the last time , has seen only three world records be@@ aten , whereas a wave of them was expected .
One record was improved on by the Hungarian , E@@ vel@@ yn Ver@@ ra@@ sz@@ to , 200@@ m me@@ dly , and the two others by Russia in the 4@@ x@@ 50@@ m me@@ dly rela@@ y .
A regret for B@@ ous@@ quet , who had his sight set on the 50@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle world record , for which he holds the long course title ( 20.@@ 94 ) .
In one of the two high-@@ profile swimming events , the 50@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle , it was the 28@@ -@@ year-old Fren@@ ch@@ man who made his mark with a time of 20.@@ 53 in a final , where ten swi@@ mm@@ ers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level .
B@@ ous@@ quet be@@ sted the Cro@@ at , Du@@ je Dra@@ gan@@ ja ( 20.@@ 70 ) and the Russian , Ser@@ ge@@ y Fe@@ si@@ kov ( 20.@@ 84 ) , but he did not manage to reduce the world record time ( 20.@@ 30 ) as he had envisaged .
One can always dream of better , and I had actually stated that , if the world record was in my reach , I would certainly attempt it .
Like B@@ ous@@ quet , the vast majority of swi@@ mm@@ ers were in poly@@ ure@@ th@@ ane swi@@ m@@ suits , which will not be permitted starting the 1st of January .
Having un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed 23@@ 8 world records since February 2008 , these swi@@ m@@ suits will end their ep@@ ic story in Istanbul , which had also seen the first ones in 1999 , during the same competition .
The use of these swi@@ m@@ suits did not assist the German , Rome &apos;s long course two-@@ time world champion this summer , Paul B@@ ieder@@ mann , on this occasion , where world records were at stake .
The young swi@@ mmer did not succeed in reducing the record he currently holds in the 400@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle ( 3 : 3@@ 2.@@ 77 ) , but did , nevertheless , make an impression by achieving his second personal best time ( 3 : 3@@ 4.@@ 55 ) , ahead of the Russian , Ni@@ kit@@ a Lob@@ int@@ se@@ v ( 3 : 3@@ 5.@@ 75 ) and the Dan@@ e , Mad@@ s G@@ la@@ es@@ ner ( 3 : 3@@ 6.@@ 82 ) .
I did not give it my all in this race .
I knew that I could not achieve a world record , but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission .
Lob@@ int@@ se@@ v will be a strong ri@@ val in the future , explained B@@ ieder@@ mann .
USA : a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ gu@@ s panel belonging to Z@@ ola fet@@ ches 1.5 million USD
A Roman sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ gu@@ s panel , which had notably belon@@ ged to the French writer , E@@ mile Z@@ ola , fet@@ ched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday , a significantly higher figure than was estimated , announced art auction house So@@ the@@ by &apos;s .
This front panel , measuring two metres in length and 6@@ 3@@ cm in height , dating back to the 3rd century AD , was valued at 150@@ ,000 to 25@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars .
The marble &quot; depic@@ ting four Di@@ ony@@ sian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor , surrounded by sat@@ y@@ rs and bac@@ ch@@ antes , is a rare piece ; there are only five of them in the world &quot; , Flor@@ ent Hein@@ tz , vic@@ e-@@ president of art au@@ ctions for Roman and Egyptian anti@@ qui@@ ties , had explained to the AF@@ P on Tuesday .
It was sold among around a hundred other lots .
The auction is still going on , but this lot is certainly the one , which has got buyers bi@@ d@@ ding most so far , comm@@ ented So@@ the@@ by &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man to the AF@@ P , D@@ an Aber@@ ne@@ thy .
The discovery of E@@ mile Z@@ ola &apos;s acquisition of this marble piece dates back some time .
The panel remained in the famous collection of the Bor@@ gh@@ ese family in Rome for nearly 300 years , then it succ@@ essively appeared with the French ac@@ tress , C@@ é@@ ci@@ le So@@ rel , who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris man@@ sion , then Paul Re@@ yn@@ au@@ d , a minister in France &apos;s 3rd Republic and briefly the Council &apos;s chairman before Mar@@ sh@@ al Pé@@ tain &apos;s accession to power .
That left a grey area of about fif@@ ty years .
By searching the Louvre Museum &apos;s database , Flor@@ ent Hein@@ tz discovered that the panel was part of an &quot; E@@ mile Z@@ ola inher@@ it@@ ance &quot; opened in 19@@ 03 , a year after the death of the author of &quot; Th@@ ér@@ è@@ se Ra@@ qu@@ in &quot; and the series of &quot; Rou@@ g@@ on-@@ Mac@@ qu@@ art &quot; no@@ vels .
Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s departure attempt from Hon@@ dur@@ as to Mexico abor@@ ted
Mexico judged on Thursday that conditions were no longer suitable for the transfer into its territory of the de@@ posed Hon@@ du@@ ran president , Manuel Z@@ el@@ aya , who had been refused safe passage by the cou@@ p-@@ installed Government .
At the moment , after a telephone conversation in the night with president Z@@ el@@ aya , everything seems to indicate that the potential options for carrying out this transfer are not suitable , declared the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Patri@@ cia Esp@@ ino@@ sa .
Having arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya , the Mexican Government plane returned to its original location , according to a source from the General Direc@@ torate of Mig@@ rations .
The Cou@@ p Government had wanted to force Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya to &quot; re@@ sign &quot; and had requested a foreign asylum to allow him safe passage to .
But the president refused , because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the inc@@ umb@@ ent Head of State and an invited guest .
The Cou@@ p Government &quot; has again met with failure by wanting me to give up my duties ( ... ) ; they wanted me to re@@ sign &quot; , Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya told radio Glob@@ o on Thursday , through which he often makes himself heard , since the beginning of the political crisis , which has so far la@@ sted five months in this country of Central America .
I could stay here ten years , I have my guitar here , added the de@@ posed president while playing a few ch@@ ords , having taken refuge at the Brazilian Emb@@ assy in Te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa for the last two and a half months .
The Mexican Emb@@ assy presented us with a request for safe passage , but , unfortunately , we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request , the Cou@@ p Government Inter@@ ior Minister , O@@ scar Rau@@ l Mat@@ ute , had declared on Wednesday on Hon@@ du@@ ran HR@@ N radio .
I am not requesting asylum from any country , Manuel Z@@ el@@ aya had answered in an interview on the Tel@@ es@@ ur channel , based in Car@@ ac@@ as .
Any departure from Hon@@ dur@@ as would have to be as the president of the Hon@@ du@@ ran people , he had emphasised .
The rum@@ ours of Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s departure had , on Wednesday , mobili@@ sed the parti@@ sans of the de@@ posed president , who gathered around the Brazilian Emb@@ assy , where military forces reinforced their position .
The Brazilian Foreign Minister , Cel@@ so Am@@ or@@ im , criticised the Cou@@ p Government &apos;s position .
This demonstrates the margin@@ al character of this Government in relation with international standards , he asser@@ ted .
Z@@ el@@ aya , who had become closer with the socialist Venezu@@ el@@ an president , Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez , had been over@@ turned on June 28@@ th , the day he had organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-@@ election , going against the views of the Supreme Court , the Army and Congress .
Ex@@ iled to Costa Rica , he had made a surprise return on September 21st and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Emb@@ assy .
If he comes out , he will be arrested to answer to charges of &quot; high treas@@ on &quot; , which the Law acc@@ uses him of , according to the Cou@@ p Government .
The Cou@@ p President , Rober@@ to Mich@@ el@@ etti , has managed to organise a presidential election on the 29@@ th of November to replace Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya .
Por@@ fi@@ ri@@ o Lob@@ o was elected in the controversial vote , which was recognised by the United States , but was con@@ tested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela , Argentina , and Brazil .
Three days later , Congress voted by a land@@ slide against Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s return to power for the remain@@ der of his term up to January 27@@ th .
Wall Street rises , the commercial balance of the US feeds optim@@ ism
The New York Stock Exchange finished higher on Thursday , as American commercial equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um figures indicate a return of activity in the United States and with its partners : the Do@@ w gained 0.@@ 67 % , and the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q 0.@@ 33 % .
According to the final closing figures , the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage rose by 6@@ 8.@@ 78 points to 10 40@@ 5.@@ 83 points , and the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q , with a technology domin@@ ance , rose by 7.@@ 13 points to 2 19@@ 0.@@ 06 points .
The broader Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s 500 index had a result of 0.@@ 58 % ( 6.@@ 40 points ) taking it to 1 10@@ 2.@@ 35 points .
We have good news coming from various sides of the Economy , assessed Lin@@ d@@ sey Pie@@ g@@ za from FT@@ N Financial .
However , this remains an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al evidence , she cau@@ tioned , sugge@@ sting the market was focusing on &quot; the glass being half full &quot; .
Peter Cardi@@ llo of A@@ val@@ on Partners thinks that investors have concentrated particularly on America &apos;s commercial balance figures , &quot; which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter &quot; .
The US commercial deficit dropped by 7.@@ 6 % in October , compared to September , to 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion dollars .
An@@ alyst@@ s were expecting the opposite , a deep@@ ening of the deficit .
Both imports and exports increased .
The big news is the increase in trade volumes , especially in the export of goods , which reflects the economical growth of the commercial partners of the United States , comm@@ ented Christop@@ her Corn@@ ell from the research company Econom@@ y@@ .com .
In contrast , new unemployment claims in the United States have increased beyond all expectations in the past week , to reach 4@@ 74 000 claims .
However , in the last four weeks , the average number of new employment seekers &quot; has fallen to its lowest in a year &quot; , highlighted Scott Mar@@ cou@@ il@@ ler from Well@@ s Far@@ go Ad@@ vis@@ ors .
The bond market has fallen .
Treas@@ ury 10-@@ year bond yiel@@ ds have grown to 3.@@ 4@@ 82 % against 3.@@ 4@@ 23 % on Tuesday evening , and 30-@@ year bond yiel@@ ds are at 4.@@ 4@@ 92 % against 4.@@ 4@@ 08 % the previous evening .
Cuba : hundreds of Government supporters speak out against the &quot; Ladies in White &quot;
Several hundred Cuban pro-@@ government demonstr@@ ators spoke out on Thursday against political prisoners &apos; wi@@ ves , who had gathered in Hav@@ ana for International Human Rights Day , and prevented another demonstration , for which around a do@@ zen dis@@ sidents were arrested .
Around for@@ ty &quot; White Ladies &quot; , wi@@ ves and those close to the political prisoners , were je@@ ered at in the street by supporters of Rau@@ l Castro &apos;s government as they were mar@@ ching towards the centre of the capital to demand the liber@@ ation of the political prisoners , observed an AF@@ P re@@ porter .
D@@ own with the Y@@ anks ! , &quot; Merc@@ en@@ aries ! &quot; , &quot; The street belongs to the Revolu@@ tion@@ aries ! &quot; , &quot; Long live F@@ ide@@ l and Rau@@ l ! &quot; the pro-@@ government supporters chan@@ ted at the dis@@ sidents , their fi@@ sts raised .
These latter were es@@ cor@@ ted by pla@@ inc@@ lo@@ thes agents , who had come to &quot; ensure their protection &quot; .
The previous evening , a similar demonstration had taken place against the &quot; Ladies in White &quot; in Hav@@ ana without anyone being injured or arrested .
However , in the V@@ ed@@ ado district of Hav@@ ana , a do@@ zen dis@@ sidents , who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day , were arrested by pla@@ inc@@ lo@@ thes police , reported an AF@@ P journalist .
The poli@@ c@@ emen made the dis@@ sidents , who had been je@@ ered at by pro-@@ government supporters , get into un@@ marked vehicles , according to the journalist .
Dis@@ sident arre@@ sts under similar circumstances normally only last a few hours .
Rec@@ i@@ pi@@ ents of the 2005 Sak@@ har@@ ov Prize from the European Parliament , the &quot; Ladies in White &quot; had organised a non-@@ authorised mar@@ ch to &quot; demand the release of all political prisoners &quot; , tot@@ alling 200 according to the dis@@ sident side , declared one of their leaders , Lau@@ ra P@@ oll@@ an , whose husband , H@@ ec@@ tor M@@ ace@@ da , is serving a 20-@@ year sentence in prison .
Mr. M@@ ace@@ da is part of the group of 75 Cuban dis@@ sidents arrested in March 2003 , 53 of which remain behind bars .
The Cuban authorities consider the opposition as &quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries &quot; or &quot; agents &quot; on the books of their s@@ worn enemy , the United States .
Un@@ usually , Cuban television covered the demonstration of pro-@@ government supporters against the &quot; anti-@@ revolution@@ aries &quot; on Thursday .
Cuba , lead by a single party , the Communist Party , is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of fl@@ ou@@ ting rights and liber@@ ties , notably those of the freedom of expression .
A ma@@ d@@ man k@@ ills an ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old with a kni@@ fe and wo@@ unds 5 at C@@ lich@@ y-@@ la-@@ Gar@@ enne
A cra@@ zed man armed with two kni@@ ves has killed a man in his eigh@@ ties and wo@@ unded five other people in the city centre of C@@ lich@@ y-@@ la-@@ Gar@@ enne ( Hau@@ ts-@@ de@@ -S@@ eine ) , during rus@@ h hour , towards the end of Thursday .
We have learned from witn@@ esses and from police that , according to the investigation &apos;s initial findings , the attack@@ er , aged 28 , appears to have struck an ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old with two kni@@ ves for reasons that remain unclear , in or at the front of a pharm@@ acy at 85 Bou@@ levard Jean-@@ J@@ au@@ r@@ ès .
Having sustained severe wo@@ unds , the elderly man , born in 1929 according to the police union , Alliance , died from his inj@@ uries in the hospital .
In or in front of the same pharm@@ acy , he then began att@@ acking a couple , including a pregn@@ ant woman .
The husband , aged around thirty , came between them and was wo@@ unded .
The first two victims , gra@@ vely wo@@ unded , were admitted to the hospital , where the ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old man died .
The days of the other injured person may be num@@ ber@@ ed , as vital organs have apparently been affected , according to police sources .
The pregn@@ ant woman was subsequently taken ill and was hosp@@ itali@@ sed &quot; in a state of shock &quot; , according to one police source .
The armed man , who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs , according to a police source , fl@@ ed into the street along Bou@@ levard Jean J@@ au@@ r@@ ès .
He is reported to have wo@@ unded two pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , apparently at random : one thir@@ ty-@@ year-old , and one fort@@ y-@@ year-old , the latter severely .
By the evening , the scenario remained unclear .
He was armed with two but@@ cher &apos;s kni@@ ves that he carried cro@@ ssed on his back , explained Ar@@ nau@@ d Press@@ é at the scene , an officer from the Alliance union of Hau@@ ts-@@ de@@ -S@@ eine .
Several pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , including some young@@ sters , attempted to over@@ power the ma@@ d@@ man , according to witness reports collected by the AF@@ P .
I saw a guy of about thirty with a green jack@@ et .
Three you@@ ths tried to intervene .
They could not manage it , because the guy was well-@@ built , re@@ counted Alber@@ to , a server in a nearby bar .
A crowd fell on him , including a town poli@@ c@@ em@@ an , who broke his w@@ r@@ ist , he added .
Still on Jean-@@ J@@ au@@ r@@ ès Bou@@ levard , outside number 61 , two town poli@@ c@@ emen , one of whom was the chief , attempted to arrest the armed man and were injured by pun@@ ches , according to police sources .
The events took place on one of C@@ lich@@ y-@@ la-@@ Gar@@ enne &apos;s main streets , where many local businesses operate .
Some pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by came to tell me that there was someone injured outside .
I went out , saw a 7@@ 0-@@ year-old on the ground , put the person in the recovery position , then I noticed a severe wo@@ und on the ab@@ d@@ omen , Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ric Alli@@ one , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old pharmac@@ ist , told the AF@@ P .
Five minutes later , a second person arrived , aged around thirty , with kni@@ fe wo@@ unds .
National police officers were the ones who arrested the man , who was not carrying any identification documents .
The case will be brought to the Nan@@ ter@@ re Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office by the region &apos;s police service for Hau@@ ts-@@ de@@ -S@@ eine ( SD@@ P@@ J 92 ) .
The ma@@ d@@ man was taken to a hospital on Thursday evening .
He had not yet had a chance to speak after being taken into cu@@ sto@@ dy .
A police source did not exclude the possibility of him being committed to a psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c hospital .
According to another police source , six poli@@ c@@ emen were needed to sub@@ due the man at the police station in C@@ lich@@ y , where he was taken .
He was &quot; in a state of hyper@@ exc@@ itement &quot; as are &quot; all cra@@ zed people of this kind , whose strength increases ten@@ fold under its effect &quot; .
USA : Pol@@ an@@ ski &apos;s lawyer calls af@@ res@@ h for proceedings to be dropped
The lawyer of the Fran@@ co-@@ Polish film director , Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski , called again in Los Angeles on Thursday ( California , western United States ) , for the aband@@ on@@ ment of proceedings against his client , who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old .
C@@ had Hum@@ mel , the lawyer for the director of &quot; The Pi@@ an@@ ist &quot; c@@ ited grave errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977 , in front of three judges at the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al of California &apos;s second district .
I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now , declared Mr. Hum@@ mel , before adding that the behaviour of the judge , who was dealing with the case at the time , Lau@@ rence Rit@@ ten@@ band , &quot; sends ch@@ ills down the sp@@ ine &quot; .
According to him , judge Rit@@ ten@@ band -- since dec@@ e@@ ased -- is said to have spoken with one of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , who told him that Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski deser@@ ved prison , before passing sentence -- con@@ stit@@ uting a serious error in procedure .
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary &quot; Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski : wanted and desired &quot; , the words coming straight from the prosec@@ utor in question , David Well@@ s .
However , Mr. Well@@ s had eventually declared that he had &quot; lied &quot; to the author of the documentary at the end of September .
In the event of the court &apos;s refusal to abandon proceedings , Mr. Hum@@ mel called for a trial to be held , which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments .
The Pro@@ sec@@ ution , for its part , has re-@@ it@@ er@@ ated its argument , already formed in the first instance , that no aband@@ on@@ ment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski did not present himself in court .
The 7@@ 6-@@ year-old film@@ maker had fl@@ ed the United States before his sentence had been passed for &quot; un@@ lawful sexual relations &quot; with a 13@@ -@@ year-old minor .
He has not set foot in the United States since .
The dep@@ uty prosec@@ utor for Los Angeles County , Phy@@ lli@@ s A@@ sa@@ y@@ ama , therefore declared that Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski &quot; must be present at the hearing &quot; .
For this case , are we trying to send the message , not just to ( Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski ) but also other defen@@ dants , that it is ok to fle@@ e ? asked Mr@@ s. A@@ sa@@ y@@ ama .
In her view , the film@@ maker &quot; is asking a favour from the court , while at the same time showing dis@@ regard for its authority &quot; .
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their verdi@@ ct -- has also emphasised &quot; that there are other alternatives to fle@@ eing &quot; .
Mr. Hum@@ mel was not the only one to request that proceedings against Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski be abandoned .
The lawyer of Sam@@ anth@@ a Gei@@ mer , the victim , also called once again for an end to the proceedings .
R@@ emin@@ ding that her client can no longer stand to be har@@ ass@@ ed with every res@@ ur@@ facing of the Pol@@ an@@ ski case , she added : &quot; No one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure .
Thir@@ ty two years is enough &quot; .
Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski was arrested on the 26@@ th of September in Switzerland on an American warrant .
After more than two months behind bars , he was put under house arrest at his chal@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad , pending his possible extra@@ dition .
Wall Street clo@@ ses without momentum , s@@ lowed by a strengthening dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday , in a market tor@@ n between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar : the Do@@ w Jones gained 0.@@ 63 % but the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q dropped 0.@@ 03 % .

It remains within a narrow margin ; trading volumes have become very weak , and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year .

Mis@@ s World pa@@ ge@@ ant once again in South Africa
After a mon@@ th-@@ long tre@@ k across South Africa , the 112 candidates for the title of Mis@@ s World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true : to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television vie@@ wers .
During this grand beauty con@@ gre@@ gation organised for the second consec@@ utive year around Johannesburg , five of them have already land@@ ed their tickets to the semi-@@ final .
Mis@@ s Japan , E@@ ru@@ za S@@ as@@ aki , Per@@ la Bel@@ tra@@ n A@@ co@@ sta of Mexico , Mari@@ at@@ u Kar@@ g@@ bo of Sierra Leone , Ka@@ i@@ ane Al@@ dor@@ ino from Gibraltar , and Y@@ an@@ bing M@@ a from Canada have been elected Mis@@ s World Spor@@ ts@@ woman or also Mis@@ s World Top Model during their African stay .
It was a real whi@@ rl@@ wind .
To visit beautiful cities like Port Eli@@ za@@ beth , Dur@@ ban , and Cape Town is extraordinary .
I saw so many things and I have so much new experience , said Mis@@ s of Sierra Leone .
This competition , which is taking place in South Africa for the n@@ in@@ th time , will be transmitted live on Saturday from Mi@@ dr@@ and , north of Johannesburg , starting at 17 : 00 ( 15 : 00 GM@@ T ) .
I could not have dre@@ amed of a better country to award my cro@@ wn .
The experience was fascinating .
I am pleased to have been able to live it twice , points out Mis@@ s World K@@ sen@@ ia Su@@ k@@ hin@@ ova in the heat of the southern summer .
For the young Russian , her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-@@ discovery &quot; of landscapes in this country that take your bre@@ ath away &quot; .
After a month of gal@@ as , re@@ hear@@ s@@ als , press meetings , and saf@@ aris , the Mis@@ s candidates are concent@@ rating on the competition .
The Indian P@@ oo@@ ja Ch@@ op@@ ra hopes to follow in the foot@@ steps of Pri@@ y@@ an@@ ka Ch@@ op@@ ra , elected in 2000 and present at this vote , as well as those of A@@ ish@@ war@@ ya Ra@@ i in 1994 , both of whom have become stars of B@@ oll@@ y@@ wood .
It is the dream of every woman to be cro@@ wn@@ ed the most beautiful woman in the world , but it is not all about appearance .
We are amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for our countries and I want to return home with the cro@@ wn , asser@@ ts Mis@@ s India with a broad s@@ mile .
According to organis@@ ers , music and dance will mark this 5@@ 9th edition .
Can@@ di@@ dates will par@@ ade in traditional out@@ fits and , of course , in swi@@ m@@ suits .
The show will be presented by Angela C@@ how , an ethnic Chinese television present@@ er , the South African ex-@@ beauty qu@@ een Mich@@ elle Mc@@ L@@ ean , and an officer from the Mis@@ s World Committee , Steve Dou@@ glas .
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better , affir@@ ms Ju@@ lia Mor@@ ley , president of Mis@@ s World .
The candidates went on saf@@ ari , as they did last year , visited the famous to@@ wn@@ ship of So@@ we@@ to , but this time by bicycle , and sam@@ pled the local cuisine .
Ex@@ cep@@ tionally , they also met the South African president , Jac@@ ob Z@@ uma , who sh@@ ook their hands .
Un@@ usual for a head of State , notes Mis@@ s Sierra Leone .
Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town ( Sou@@ thwest ) for football in June 2010 , a way for the country to promote the event a little more .
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach .
I will without a doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup , enth@@ uses Mis@@ s Italy , Ali@@ ce T@@ ati@@ c@@ chi .
The news about John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day &quot; is very positive &quot; , according to son David
The news about John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day &quot; is very positive &quot; , assu@@ res his son , David , on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles , where he was to be by his father &apos;s bed@@ side , who has been in hospital for several days .
The news is very positive .
He is very strong , all will go well , declared his son , David H@@ all@@ y@@ day , to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13 : 00 local time ( 21 : 00 GM@@ T ) .
The singer &apos;s son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading &quot; without delay &quot; to the Ce@@ dar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital in Los Angeles , where John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day was admitted on Monday for an infection stem@@ ming from a sli@@ pped disc operation on November 26@@ th in Paris .
The singer was &quot; put in an artificial com@@ a tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons , to prevent his suffering , and to allow his treatment to be administ@@ ered &quot; , indicated the press service .
John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day had already been put in an artificial com@@ a by doctors at the Ce@@ dar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital in Los Angeles , where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection stem@@ ming from a sli@@ pped disc operation on the 26@@ th of November in Paris .
The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant le@@ sions resulting from the operation .
His wife , La@@ e@@ ti@@ cia , went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School , where their daughter J@@ ade is en@@ rolled , to attend a school performance , observed an AF@@ P photographer .
The Head of Or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c and Trau@@ ma Sur@@ gery of the P@@ iti@@ é@@ -S@@ alp@@ ê@@ tri@@ ère hospital , Y@@ ves Cat@@ on@@ é , announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday .
The producer veh@@ em@@ ently brought into question Dr. St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x , the neu@@ ro-@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , who operated on the singer on the 26@@ th of November at the International Clin@@ ic of Parc Mon@@ ce@@ au in Paris .
They told us it was car@@ n@@ age .
The Los Angeles sur@@ ge@@ ons said they were ag@@ hast , declared Mr. Cam@@ us .
I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come , he said .
Jean-@@ Claude Cam@@ us reck@@ oned that John@@ ny H@@ all@@ y@@ day had &quot; left far too soon for Los Angeles , with the Paris sur@@ ge@@ on &apos;s authorisation &quot; .
I had this doctor on the phone in person , and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip , which sho@@ cked me , as I , myself , have had two sli@@ pped disc@@ s , he added .
Shor@@ tly before , on RT@@ L , he had indicated that the singer apparently &quot; had left without a dra@@ in or anything &quot; , following his Paris operation .
Dr St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x is well-known in artistic circles .
He had operated on the ac@@ tress Marie Trin@@ ti@@ gn@@ ant in Vil@@ ni@@ us a few days before her death at a clin@@ ic in Neu@@ ill@@ y-@@ sur@@ -S@@ eine , where he practic@@ ed at the time .
In 2007 , he had also operated on the ac@@ tress Char@@ lo@@ tte Ga@@ ins@@ bourg to res@@ or@@ b a ha@@ em@@ atom@@ a , following a cer@@ eb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
However , he is also a doctor with a not@@ orious reputation , convi@@ cted by the Law on several occasions , in cases of medical liability , as well as for fraud and tax ev@@ asion .
Oli@@ vier M@@ etz@@ ner , the lawyer for the Doc@@ tors &apos; governing body , accused him of being &quot; a man without sc@@ ru@@ ples &quot; , who &quot; regularly &quot; has to answer to the governing body &apos;s Council , and who is &quot; far from rep@@ utable &quot; .
After several days of silence , Dr. St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x made an announcement on Friday through his so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , David K@@ oub@@ bi .
The latter indicated that the operation had &quot; gone perfectly well &quot; and that post-@@ operation tests returned &quot; normal &quot; .
The operation &quot; was not ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic and therefore did not required a dra@@ in to be fitted &quot; , he added .
In any case , the singer &apos;s tour , for whom health problems have been multi@@ plying since the summer , would seem to be on hold .
Clearly , resu@@ ming the tour on the 8th of January &#91; in A@@ mi@@ ens &#93; as planned seems very soon , declared Mr. Cam@@ us .
The U@@ DF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m
The U@@ DF alliance , controlled by Franç@@ ois Bay@@ ro@@ u &apos;s Democratic Mo@@ vement ( Mo@@ Dem ) , re@@ acted on Friday to the bu@@ y-@@ out bid made by the New Centre &apos;s president , Her@@ v@@ é Mor@@ in , for the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m of the former G@@ is@@ car@@ dian party , by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances , threatening legal action otherwise .
Her@@ v@@ é Mor@@ in announced publicly that he intended to rec@@ ou@@ p the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m , ruling that Franç@@ ois Bay@@ ro@@ u was not worthy of its political heritage , having extended his hand to the Left .
The Defence Minister , whose party is partner to the UM@@ P , had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the N@@ C &apos;s national Council .
In support of his move , he received backing from dep@@ uty Her@@ v@@ é de Cha@@ re@@ tte ( ex-@@ UM@@ P swit@@ ched to N@@ C ) , who claims his ownership of the U@@ DF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute .
However , Friday evening , the U@@ DF Alliance &apos;s office , headed by Franç@@ ois Bay@@ ro@@ u &apos;s friends , who do not plan to give up possession , has come out of silence to launch an attack against the dep@@ uty , ordering him not to use the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m , and to transfer the trademark &apos;s ownership to them , otherwise threatening legal action .
In the last few days , you have step@@ ped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to reg@@ ain the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m , the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office , including Franç@@ ois Bay@@ ro@@ u and Mari@@ elle de Sar@@ nez from the Mo@@ Dem , as well as the sen@@ ator , Jean Ar@@ thu@@ is , from the centre Alliance .
You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website &apos;s homepage the movement &apos;s name , the New Centre , and to follow it with the s@@ logan : today &apos;s U@@ DF , remark those who signed the document .
As you are well aware , you have no right to the use of the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m , explains the U@@ DF &apos;s office , requiring that the N@@ C remove &quot; immediately any mention of the U@@ DF name from all material , and from ( their ) internet site &quot; .
He also requests that Her@@ v@@ é de Cha@@ re@@ tte &quot; transfer ownership of the trademark to its ri@@ ghtful owners &quot; .
If you failed to do this , the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of U@@ DF members were respected , war@@ n the document &apos;s sign@@ atories .
In their communication , they specify that the U@@ DF &quot; is a political movement in its own right since 1978 &quot; and points out that Mr. Mor@@ in and his friends had &quot; made their choice &quot; to leave him in 2007 &quot; to create a competing movement , as others had done in 2002 , to establish the UM@@ P &quot; .
The New Centre , according to them , has therefore no right to the use of the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ( Union for French Democracy ) .
They also remind that the U@@ DF &apos;s last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the Mo@@ Dem for three years , and for the creation of an office charged with defending &quot; the material and moral interests &quot; of the body founded by Val@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ card d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing .
As for Her@@ v@@ é de Cha@@ re@@ tte , the office continues , &quot; when he registered the trademark &quot; , he had &quot; not been a U@@ DF member for three years &quot; , but , in fact , with the UM@@ P .
He is prof@@ iting in a scand@@ alous and frau@@ dul@@ ent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m by taking it to benefit his own account .
This incident is turning into a major off@@ ence , they state , before adding ir@@ on@@ ically about the N@@ C &apos;s strategy that : &quot; in our opinion , in politics as in real life , it is more dign@@ i@@ fied to make one &apos;s own name rather than try to become somebody by frau@@ dul@@ ently acqu@@ iring a name we have no right to &quot; .
L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court C@@ ase : Franç@@ o@@ is-@@ Marie Ban@@ ier will be tried for &quot; abuse of weakness &quot;
The Nan@@ ter@@ re tri@@ bunal decided on Friday to bring Franç@@ o@@ is-@@ Marie Ban@@ ier to trial to as@@ certain whether , as the daughter of billi@@ on@@ ai@@ ress L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court is acc@@ using him , he prof@@ ited from the ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old &apos;s weak@@ ened mental state to des@@ po@@ il her of some of her fortun@@ e .
The photographer , 62 , known for his photographs of the stars , will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for &quot; abuse of weakness &quot; , an off@@ ence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 3@@ 75 000 euro fine .
The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case , which is turning into a worthy family sag@@ a involving one of the rich@@ est families in France , where mother and daughter are tor@@ n apart , while at the re@@ ins of the L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al cosme@@ tics empire .
However , the 15th Magi@@ str@@ ate &apos;s Court has also ordered a combined expert medical opinion of L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court , aged 87 , to be led by three doctors .
The hei@@ ress and principal share@@ holder of L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al has always refused to under@@ go such an ex@@ am , at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nan@@ ter@@ re court at the time of the investigation .
The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by the 10th of March , 2010 , stating , in particular , whether L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court could have found herself in a weak@@ ened state and at which times .
I think she will submit to it .
I will talk with her about it , declared Mr@@ s. Bet@@ ten@@ court &apos;s lawyer , Geor@@ ges Kie@@ j@@ man , at the exit of the hearing .
For his part , the lawyer of Franç@@ o@@ ise Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers , Oli@@ vier M@@ etz@@ ner , congratul@@ ated himself on the court &apos;s decision .
It is excellent news ( … ) The expert opinion will prove that he ( Mr. Ban@@ ier ) manipul@@ ated this elderly lady , whom we should be protecting , he affir@@ med .
For two years , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court &apos;s daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against Franç@@ o@@ is-@@ Marie Ban@@ ier , the photographer and all-@@ round artist , whom she acc@@ uses of prof@@ iting for years from her mother &apos;s weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations , in the form of ch@@ equ@@ es , life insurance contracts , or works of art .
As far as she is concerned , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court has always re@@ fut@@ ed having been manipul@@ ated by the photographer , who she considers a long-@@ standing friend .
As the court on Friday was due to examine the ad@@ mis@@ sibility of the case brought by Mr@@ s. Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers , the ple@@ as from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an un@@ vei@@ ling of intimate family matters .
Thus , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court &apos;s lawyer c@@ ited three letters sent by his client ( in 1999 , 2003 , and 2005 ) to her so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , in which she expressed having suspi@@ ci@@ ons about Franç@@ o@@ ise Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers &apos; husband .
In the letter dated from 2003 , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court added , according to the lawyer : &quot; could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Ban@@ ier once or twice a day for fifteen years . &quot;
I have been unable to speak to Franç@@ o@@ ise since her marriage &quot; .
For its part , the Court in Nan@@ ter@@ re has again ruled that the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s claim was not ad@@ missible for action , all the more so after a judge super@@ vising guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship refused her request in the past few days to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother .
L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court &quot; is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings , she is not under protection and does not have a guar@@ dian .
N@@ obo@@ dy needs to act on her behalf &quot; , affir@@ ms the Public Pro@@ sec@@ ution &apos;s representative , Mar@@ ie-@@ Christ@@ ine Dau@@ big@@ ney .
The Court determined that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the ad@@ mis@@ sibility of Mr@@ s. Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers &apos;s claim had taken place .
A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence ?
If nothing changes in the way France &apos;s biggest enterprises are run , our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in v@@ ain …
For over ten years , the Management &apos;s attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution : employees should be made to adhere to &quot; values &quot; dict@@ ated from above just as it was in the past , when products dre@@ amed up by the factory &apos;s engineers were dropped on the consumer .
By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation , the marketing revolution put the strategies for con@@ qu@@ ering markets the right way up again ... even if authoritarian temp@@ tation to impose products , which are dis@@ connected from the preferences of the consumer tend to res@@ ur@@ face regularly !
A demo@@ bili@@ sation of employees can lead to terminal dem@@ or@@ alisation .
Su@@ ici@@ des at France Telec@@ om , PS@@ A and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular .
Dem@@ ob@@ ili@@ sation gra@@ vely compromises the development of an organisation &apos;s strategic functions , notably in R &amp; D , but even more so in competitive intelligence .
Indeed , C@@ I &quot; demands from all sides concerned ( ... ) a pro@@ active approach and a long-term vision &quot; ; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradi@@ cted by authoritarian management methods .
For this reason , we are calling for a management revolution , which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise &apos;s concerns alongside consumers .
The very relative use@@ fulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in manag@@ erial methods ?
Unfortunately , I fear it will not .
- Firstly , because I have witnessed that , when faced with a new situation , any organisation will arrive , after many de@@ tours , at doing chie@@ fly ... what it always does !
- Next , because authorit@@ ari@@ anism - a disease of power - grows propor@@ tionally with the magn@@ it@@ ude of its own failures .
- Finally , because most leaders have a simpli@@ stic view of human behaviour .
Com@@ ing from the top technical educational establishments , they have a mechan@@ istic interpretation of psych@@ ology .
They adopt , for intellectual convenience , the old behavi@@ our@@ ist theory , which has recently been re-@@ aw@@ ak@@ ened by the &quot; neu@@ ro-@@ sciences &quot; of the United States that have been widely and sil@@ ently diff@@ used by business institutes and the Media .
In this way , by sugge@@ sting that &quot; le@@ vers &quot; &#91; sic &#93; can be pul@@ led for the commitment of management staff , a recent I@@ p@@ sos survey published on Fig@@ aro@@ .@@ fr cra@@ d@@ les leaders into a position of mechan@@ istic governance , which is un@@ suited to the world of today .
Identi@@ fy and quanti@@ fy mobili@@ sation factors
In contrast , the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises sup@@ poses the adoption of a fin@@ alistic vision of human behaviour .
It consists in the integration , within all management strategies and practices , of a fundamental admission : for employees , commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to reali@@ sing a part of their dreams , their ambitions , and their plans .
Currently , only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation .
These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-@@ determined consensus of opinion , which allows them , by means of this perceived view , to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans .
By identifying and gau@@ ging these mobili@@ sation factors , enterprise leaders can control , predi@@ ct and anticip@@ ate their &quot; social performance &quot; and turn their management of resources &quot; the right way round &quot; .
They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concer@@ ted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence .
Oslo speech : the &quot; just war &quot; ear@@ ns Obama praise from the Right
The American Right paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in Oslo by Barack Obama , satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of a &quot; just war &quot; against the enemies of the United States .
The con@@ servatives , who had mo@@ cked the awar@@ ding of the Prize to Obama on October 9th , were this time giving the presidential speech their ap@@ plause , lead by Sar@@ ah P@@ alin , former vic@@ e-@@ president candidate during the 2008 elections .
I liked what he said , declared Mr@@ s. P@@ alin , right-@@ wing champion of the Republi@@ can party , to the daily newspaper USA Today , adding that she had herself touched on the topic of war that is &quot; sometimes necessary &quot; in her mem@@ o@@ irs , which have just been published .
War is , of course , one of the last things , which Americans want to get involved in , but it is necessary .
We must stop these terrorists over there , she affir@@ med .
Mr. Obama , who has inher@@ ited the two wars from his predecessor , George W. Bush , in Iraq and Afghanistan , applied himself on Thursday in Oslo to justi@@ fying res@@ or@@ ting to force , a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier .
Another one of Mr. Obama &apos;s opponents , New@@ t G@@ ing@@ rich , concluded that the president had done &quot; very good work &quot; in Oslo .
I found his speech to be really very good , approved the former Spe@@ aker in the House of Represent@@ atives , who had particularly valued the mention that &quot; E@@ vi@@ l does exist in the world &quot; in the presidential dis@@ course .
From certain view@@ points , I found this speech to be of historic significance , declared Mr. G@@ ing@@ rich , during an interview for the radio show &quot; The Tak@@ e@@ away &quot; .
The former representative , considered by some a possible candidate for the Republi@@ can inau@@ gu@@ ration of the 2012 presidential elections , was delighted to see &quot; a president from the Left &quot; remind the Nob@@ le Committee members &quot; that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if res@@ or@@ ting to force had not been an option &quot; .
For Michael Ger@@ son , a former writer for George W. Bush and re-@@ converted colum@@ n@@ ist for the Washington Post , Mr. Obama has given &quot; a very American speech &quot; .
As well as presenting himself as a &quot; world citizen &quot; , as &quot; he always does &quot; , &quot; he spoke like an American President &quot; , remin@@ ding Europeans &quot; that they live in a security bub@@ ble , which they did not create and they are doing little to preserve &quot; , declared Mr. Ger@@ son .
Among the few un@@ convinced right-@@ wing@@ ers , a ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish character from the Bush era , the former UN amb@@ assador , John Bol@@ ton , described the speech as &quot; dra@@ b , tur@@ gi@@ d , and un@@ inspired &quot; on the National Review Online &apos;s website .
To the president &apos;s left , the democratic representative D@@ enn@@ is Ku@@ cin@@ ich was al@@ armed to see Barack Obama justify res@@ or@@ ting to force .
When we wra@@ p war inside the notion of justice , the mass@@ acre of innocent people can easily be justified , he warned .
Cent@@ re-@@ left Press nevertheless remained full of praise for the president .
The Los Angeles Times , still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize had been pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely awarded to Mr. Obama , described his address as &quot; a block@@ bu@@ ster &quot; , even for a speaker that is known for his talent .
The Oslo speech &quot; should serve as a road@@ map for guiding international decisions made on conflicts , poverty and op@@ pression &quot; , enth@@ used the Califor@@ ni@@ an newspaper .
Mr. Obama &quot; made the speech that was needed &quot; , reports the New York Times , jud@@ ging it &quot; both som@@ bre and edi@@ fying &quot; .
Road freight : three mar@@ ath@@ ons for one agreement to save Christmas deliveries
Following three mar@@ athon sessions of negotiations , transport unions and the T@@ L@@ F , the only emplo@@ yer &apos;s organisation to have remained to the end , reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries .
During the signing on Friday evening , Transport Secretary Domini@@ que Bus@@ ser@@ eau was &quot; delighted &quot; with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning .
After a second night of discussions , negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swift signing of the agreement &apos;s text later in the morning .
And this , despite three employers &apos; organisations ( F@@ NT@@ R , UN@@ O@@ ST@@ RA , OT@@ RE ) having sl@@ amm@@ ed the door .
However , it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11@@ am for everyone to be in agreement , and for the text to be signed at 6@@ pm .
The dis@@ agreement &quot; would have been very damaging for the companies &quot; and &quot; it looked like it might threaten the end of year festi@@ vities &quot; , Mr. Bus@@ ser@@ eau stated .
The document allows for a 4 % increase in salaries for the lowest ones ( in local and regional road transport ) , and a 2.@@ 9 % increase for higher ones ( international transport ) .
H@@ our@@ ly rates , for those on lower pay , &quot; go from 8.@@ 72 euros to 9.@@ 06 .
It is not much , but we have come a long way , explains Patri@@ ce C@@ los ( Wor@@ ker &apos;s Union ) .
This evening we will give the order to our campaign@@ ers not to form block@@ ades or pi@@ cket at delivery de@@ pots .
There may , however , always be a few difficult ones , who remain un@@ cooperative , he added .
Phili@@ ppe Gri@@ l@@ lot , president of the T@@ L@@ F , paid tribute to &quot; a good agreement &quot; , even if it was &quot; difficult to conc@@ ede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition &quot; .
According to him , the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones .
It is a common sense agreement , respecting the workers , declared Maxim@@ e D@@ um@@ ont ( CF@@ D@@ T ) , while Th@@ ier@@ ry Dou@@ ine ( C@@ FT@@ C ) pra@@ ised it as &quot; a historic agreement &quot; .
As for Richard J@@ auber@@ t ( C@@ G@@ T ) , he described it as &quot; an acceptable compromise &quot; .
The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3 % and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010 , which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month &apos;s pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement .
Mr. Bus@@ ser@@ eau reminded everyone that &quot; a 100 million euro cut in employers &apos; charges &quot; had been the subject of a Government amendment in correc@@ tive financial legislation for 2009 , voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly .
The Government will ask that the Sen@@ ate vote on it &quot; in the same time@@ frame &quot; .
The signature from the T@@ L@@ F allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation , and secondly , to the whole profession , subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour .
It will be done &quot; in a very short time &quot; , assu@@ res Mr. Bus@@ ser@@ eau .
The opposing employers &apos; organisations can only delay the process .
The F@@ NT@@ R called it a &quot; sha@@ m &quot; , because the 100 million euros &quot; had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax &quot; .
The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table , not with the aim of a two-@@ sided review , but to avoid up@@ setting the tur@@ ke@@ y-@@ e@@ aters this Christmas , deplo@@ res the UN@@ O@@ ST@@ RA .
For the OT@@ RE , the agreement risks &quot; dig@@ ging the gra@@ ves of a large number of the sector &apos;s SMEs over the next 12 months &quot; .
R@@ ER A : dis@@ rup@@ tions this weekend , unions un@@ happy with R@@ AT@@ P proposals
Dis@@ rup@@ tions on the R@@ ER A , the largest urban public transport link in France , are set to continue over the weekend , as a meeting on Friday , the second day of strikes , between the unions and the R@@ AT@@ P management have left their pay demands un@@ met .
Saturday and Sunday , on this critical weekend of shopping before Christmas , trains will only run between the hours of 10@@ am and 8@@ pm , with just one out of two trains running on the central stretch ( between La Dé@@ f@@ ense and Nation ) , and one out of four outside the central section .
The operation of the inter@@ change with the S@@ NC@@ F will be suspended at Nan@@ ter@@ re Pr@@ é@@ fec@@ ture , forcing passengers to change trains .
The Gal@@ eries L@@ af@@ ay@@ ette , who welcome 200 000 customers every day , were delighted by the fact that &quot; the R@@ AT@@ P is making efforts to assist the department stores &quot; .
The R@@ ER A runs through the Par@@ isi@@ an con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation from West to East .
The R@@ AT@@ P segment runs from Saint-@@ Ger@@ main@@ -@@ en-@@ La@@ ye and Nan@@ ter@@ re to Bo@@ is@@ sy@@ -@@ Saint-@@ L@@ é@@ ger and Mar@@ ne-@@ La@@ -@@ Vall@@ ée .
On Friday , approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times , with almost no trains at all during off-@@ peak periods , as planned .
As on Thursday , there was no trouble with crow@@ ds on the platforms , as Par@@ isi@@ ans had gotten themselves organised .
Thus , in the early hours , the station at Saint-@@ Ger@@ main@@ -@@ en-@@ La@@ ye ( Y@@ vel@@ ines ) was far less busy than usual , notably because of the absence of school and college students .
At Bo@@ is@@ sy@@ -@@ Saint-@@ L@@ é@@ ger ( V@@ al-@@ de-@@ Mar@@ ne ) , Jack N@@ bak@@ ina , a 29@@ -@@ year-old engineer , explained that he had gotten up &quot; an hour and a half earlier , to be sure of arriving on time &quot; .
The Saint-@@ L@@ az@@ are station did not see any over@@ crow@@ ding , the S@@ NC@@ F stated , having planned for additional support staff and police officers .
The R@@ ER A trains operated by the S@@ NC@@ F to or from C@@ erg@@ y-@@ L@@ e-@@ Haut were depar@@ ting or arriving from Saint-@@ L@@ az@@ are station , where they link with the metro .
New general meetings for stri@@ kers will be held on Saturday and Sunday , which will review the results , seen as &quot; poor &quot; by the unions , of a meeting with Management held on Friday afternoon .
The R@@ ER &apos;s director proposes to negotiate a specific agreement for the R@@ ER A on all aspects , working hours , career paths , etc …
It is not what the drivers , who are demanding the bonus they are o@@ wed , want , according to Th@@ ier@@ ry Gar@@ on ( SU@@ D ) .
The R@@ AT@@ P has even put its offer of bon@@ uses on hold , the C@@ G@@ T compla@@ ined , pointing out that the management &quot; could not be bo@@ ther@@ ed to resolve the problem , whereas road transport and the S@@ NC@@ F both have it done and du@@ sted &quot; .
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for &quot; a wider review of the conditions of practice for the profession &quot; , the R@@ AT@@ P elabor@@ ated .
Pro@@ mp@@ ting the unions to remark further that the company &quot; did not care about its weekend passengers &quot; .
During the morning , some 150 drivers inv@@ aded a works council meeting at the company &apos;s seat in Paris .
That is when Management , which had until then refused to enter into any discussions during the strike , had suggested the meeting &quot; in a motion to calm the situation &quot; .
The dispute is threatening to extend to R@@ ER B on Tuesday , following the submission of an advance notice by the UN@@ SA and the In@@ dé@@ pen@@ dants groups .
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros ( UN@@ SA ) to 150 euros , with a 30-@@ euro variable band ( C@@ G@@ T , F@@ O , CF@@ D@@ T , SU@@ D , In@@ dé@@ pen@@ dants ) and are compla@@ ining of the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day .
The R@@ ER drivers , all in the later stages of their care@@ ers , are paid a gross sal@@ ary of 2@@ 200 to 27@@ 00 euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonus pay for split shi@@ fts , Sun@@ days and holidays .
Turkish justice b@@ ans the pro-@@ Kur@@ d party , a decision laden with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a verdi@@ ct on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the country &apos;s main pro-@@ Kur@@ d party , a decision which was immediately followed by an@@ gr@@ y protests within the Kurdish community in the Sou@@ theast of the country and in Istanbul .
The decision is likely to greatly complic@@ ate the Government &apos;s work , as it has just recently made positive gest@@ ures towards the Kurdish community in an attempt to resolve a 25-@@ year old conflict .
The Party for a Democratic Society ( D@@ TP ) was dis@@ b@@ anded because it had become &quot; a hot@@ bed of damaging activities against the State &apos;s independence and its un@@ failing unity &quot; , the President of the Court , H@@ asi@@ m K@@ ili@@ ç , declared to the press at the end of four days of deliber@@ ations .
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges , while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the dis@@ b@@ anding , Mr. K@@ ili@@ ç indicated , adding that 37 of the party &apos;s representatives , including its president , Ah@@ met Tür@@ k , and the dep@@ uty , Ay@@ sel Tu@@ glu@@ k , have been ban@@ ished from political life for the next five years .
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity , from which both Mr. Tür@@ k and Mr@@ s. Tu@@ glu@@ k benef@@ ited , and the conf@@ is@@ cation of party assets by the Treas@@ ury .
The D@@ TP occup@@ ies 21 seats in Parliament ( out of 5@@ 50 ) .
Its leaders had warned prior to the verdi@@ ct that the representatives would leave Parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affili@@ ation .
The decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosec@@ utor of the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court , Ab@@ dur@@ rah@@ man Y@@ al@@ ç@@ ink@@ aya , who acc@@ uses the D@@ TP of obe@@ ying &quot; directives &quot; from the Kur@@ dist@@ an Wor@@ kers &apos; Party ( PK@@ K ) , which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and in many countries .
Many observers believe the D@@ TP serves as a legal political shop window for the PK@@ K reb@@ els .
The party maintains , however , that it has &quot; no organic links &quot; with the PK@@ K , but ref@@ uses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it .
The court &apos;s verdi@@ ct comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures , rein@@ forcing its rights in an attempt to qu@@ ash Kurdish support for the PK@@ K and put an end to the conflict .
D@@ TP leaders had stated that a dis@@ solution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the An@@ ato@@ lian Sou@@ theast , where a great number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PK@@ K &apos;s head , Ab@@ dul@@ lah Ö@@ cal@@ an , have de@@ generated into clas@@ hes with police in the last few weeks .
As soon as the Law made its announcement , a thousand prote@@ sters gathered before the D@@ TP &apos;s buildings in Di@@ yar@@ bak@@ ir , the Sou@@ theast &apos;s main city , populated mainly by Kur@@ ds .
Police forces fi@@ red te@@ ar-@@ gas gr@@ en@@ ades and used water cann@@ ons , as demonstr@@ ators thre@@ w Mol@@ ot@@ ov cocktails and stones with s@@ lings .
Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul .
Following the verdi@@ ct , Mr. Tür@@ k declared that the Law &apos;s decision would &quot; deep@@ en the des@@ pair &quot; .
Turkey cannot resolve this &#91; Kurdish &#93; issue by bann@@ ing a party , he told the Press .
The Government , a party rooted in Islamic influences , also condemned the decision .
We are opposed on principle to the closing down of parties .
It does not solve anything , declared the Energy Minister , Tan@@ er Y@@ il@@ di@@ z .
This decision puts a b@@ low@@ tor@@ ch to the Government &apos;s democratic olive branch , comments political analy@@ st Ah@@ met Insel .
Of course , we can expect a reaction from the PK@@ K , he added .
On Thursday , the PK@@ K claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the North of Turkey three days earlier , one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t in the last few months .
The snow can come
A really hard , fro@@ sty winter , that is what Wolfgang Brau@@ burger is wishing for .
Not because he wants to make a lau@@ gh@@ ing stock of people , says the the head of the F@@ ES winter road maintenance service .
But so that his employees can try out and learn every fac@@ it of their vehicle &apos;s technology .
This may be the case for the first time this weekend , according to me@@ te@@ or@@ ologists .
More than 3@@ 30 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice .
Here , the F@@ ES is proce@@ eding according to a precise plan .
As soon as Frankfurt is blan@@ k@@ eted in snow and the temperatures drop below zero , 20 so-called &quot; A Rou@@ tes &quot; are servi@@ ced by large-scale distribution vehicles , explains Brau@@ burger .
These include , for instance , main traffic roads and through roads , such as Neue Weg and Han@@ auer Land@@ strasse .
But also fire roads , public transport routes , pedestrian zones and roads with slopes , such as A@@ tz@@ el@@ berg@@ strasse .
The service of the F@@ ES starts at three in the morning
The approx . 1,@@ 0@@ 40 km would , if necessary , have to be g@@ rit@@ ted with wet salt , which has better adhe@@ sive properties , within no more than three hours .
That is why the F@@ ES start at three in the morning , &quot; so the routes are free by the time comm@@ uter traffic starts &quot; .
It becomes difficult when it only begins sno@@ wing at 7.@@ 30 am .
Then we are faced with a problem , says the head of the winter road service , &quot; because nobody is prepared to make way for the g@@ rit@@ ting vehicles &quot; .
Only then , unless it continues to snow , is it the turn of approach and connecting roads , which also include Rat@@ -@@ Bei@@ l-@@ Strasse .
The last priority are quiet side and minor roads .
That is where complaints are made , knows Brau@@ burger .
At five in the morning , the foot@@ men of the F@@ ES set to work , and dangerous areas and pass@@ ages are cle@@ ared .
The F@@ ES can usually not attend to all bike routes .
There is a special service in Frankfurt , which keeps an eye on the bridges , in particular from 10 pm until 4.@@ 30 am , says Brau@@ burger .
As sli@@ p@@ per@@ y ice quickly forms on them , the g@@ rit@@ ter sets off as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees c@@ enti@@ grade .
Where required , it is also called out by the police .
The cra@@ dle of the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs
Ta@@ wa Hal@@ la@@ e looked like many other car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs : The animal , standing two metres t@@ all and with a length of 1.@@ 50 metres on two strong h@@ ind legs , had a long@@ ish sk@@ ull with sharp , cur@@ ved teeth , short arms with si@@ ck@@ le-@@ shaped cla@@ ws and a long tail .
If the species had lived a couple of million years later , it would not be anything special .
But Ta@@ wa Hal@@ la@@ e was one of the first din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs with such physical features , reports Ster@@ ling N@@ es@@ bit@@ t and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Aus@@ tin in Science magazine of Thursday .
The animal lived about 2@@ 15 million years in what is today New Mexico , which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent Pan@@ ga@@ ea at the equ@@ ator .
Ta@@ wa opens a new window to the early evolution of din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs , says N@@ es@@ bit@@ t .
It reveals a great deal about the relationships , the spread , and the features of early din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs .
In 2006 N@@ es@@ bit@@ t and the other pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ologists started an excav@@ ation on the G@@ host Ran@@ ch in northern New Mexico .
&quot; On some days we found do@@ zen din@@ o@@ sau@@ r b@@ ones , that is exemplary for se@@ di@@ ments from the Tri@@ assi@@ c period , &quot; reports team member Rand@@ all Ir@@ mis of the U@@ ta@@ h Museum of Natural History .
The scientists identified some b@@ ones quickly .
During the excav@@ ations , they collected the remains of a total of five creatures .
Find confirms the@@ ories on early din@@ o@@ sau@@ r history
The name Ta@@ wa comes from the sun go@@ d of the Hop@@ i Indi@@ ans .
For Ster@@ ling N@@ es@@ bit@@ t , it is an exceptional find : &quot; D@@ ino@@ sau@@ r fossi@@ ls from the Tri@@ assi@@ c period are extremely rare . Mo@@ stly , only individual frag@@ ments are found . &quot;
Other din@@ o@@ sau@@ r researchers do not quite share this enthusiasm .
&quot; This find is not particularly spectacular , but it does confirm some the@@ ories on the early history of din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs . &quot; says Martin S@@ ander of the University of Bonn , for instance .
According to current doctr@@ ine , the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago .
But many of the oldest fossi@@ ls are incomplete , for which reason the classification of these pri@@ mal din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs is highly con@@ ten@@ tious .
As such , the experts debated , for instance , when the sau@@ ri@@ ans split into the three most important lines of development : the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous ther@@ o@@ po@@ ds , which later included Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x , the Vel@@ o@@ ci@@ rap@@ tor and birds , the four-@@ leg@@ ged sau@@ ro@@ po@@ ds known as the &quot; long nec@@ ks &quot; and their relatives , and the plant@@ -@@ eating Or@@ ni@@ th@@ isch@@ i@@ ae ( bir@@ d-@@ hi@@ pped sau@@ ri@@ ans ) , which included , for instance , the Tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops and Ste@@ go@@ sau@@ rus species .
According the analysis of N@@ es@@ bit@@ t and his colleagues , Ta@@ wa Hal@@ la@@ e is a pri@@ mal ther@@ o@@ po@@ d .
It has an interesting combination of primi@@ tive and progressive properties , says N@@ es@@ bit@@ t .
On the sk@@ ull of Ta@@ wa Hal@@ la@@ e , for instance , the scientists found indications of air bags , as the des@@ cen@@ dants of the ther@@ o@@ po@@ ds , birds , have .
Thanks to the air bags , the brea@@ thing of birds is more efficient than that of m@@ amm@@ als .
Ta@@ wa Hal@@ la@@ e &apos;s b@@ ones of the sp@@ ine were obviously also partly filled with air .
Ta@@ wa is the oldest and most primi@@ tive ther@@ o@@ po@@ d with air bags , says Rand@@ all Ir@@ mis .
As the related line of the huge sau@@ ro@@ po@@ ds later also had air bags and light@@ weight b@@ ones , the joint ancest@@ or of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation .
At least three migration waves to North America
As the most primi@@ tive din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs known to date lived in South America , the scientists come to the conclusion that the sau@@ ri@@ ans appeared there first .
Accordingly , the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet , which still formed a single land mass as the super continent Pan@@ ga@@ ea .
This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more ther@@ o@@ po@@ ds which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Ta@@ wa Hal@@ la@@ e .
The three cannot possibly desc@@ end from a common ancest@@ or . So they must have mig@@ rated there , is the scientists argument .
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America , says Alan Tur@@ ner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , a co-@@ author of the Science study .
But there are of course contradi@@ ctions .
An older species , Sil@@ es@@ au@@ rus , which belongs to a sister group of the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs , lived in what is today Poland , says the B@@ onn@@ -based pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ologist Martin S@@ ander .
He believes that a distor@@ ted picture may emerge simply because a high number of primi@@ tive din@@ o@@ sau@@ r fossi@@ ls have survi@@ ved over the years , while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents .
How din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs managed to develop from a relatively rare side@@ arm of the rep@@ tile tree to become the ruling te@@ tra@@ po@@ d ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate of the Mes@@ o@@ zo@@ ic , is still anybody &apos;s gu@@ ess .
During the Tri@@ assi@@ c period , the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs still shared their habit@@ at with a large amount of other rep@@ tiles , for instance with the ancest@@ ors of today &apos;s cro@@ codi@@ le and p@@ tero@@ sau@@ rs and with numerous other sau@@ ri@@ ans .
To@@ wards the end of the Tri@@ assi@@ c period , the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs spread across the globe and developed many new species , while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Tri@@ assi@@ c to the Ju@@ ras@@ sic periods .
Su@@ cc@@ ess story did not last for ever
There are two the@@ ories to explain this switch , says Martin S@@ ander .
There may have been a case of mass dying , which the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs rand@@ om@@ ly survi@@ ved but not the other rep@@ tiles .
Or the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs were better adjusted , meaning that they were able to beat off the competition .
In any event , the success story did not last for ever .
150 million years later , a me@@ te@@ or@@ ite impact helped a group of animals , which had also developed back in the Tri@@ assi@@ c period and since lived in the sha@@ dows to b@@ los@@ som : the m@@ amm@@ als .
Solidarity from Vienna to Sa@@ o Paulo
The list is long and the sign@@ atories international .
Prof@@ essors of Tor@@ onto University are on it , as are those from the University of Cambridge , the University of Vienna and Ber@@ kel@@ ey in California .
L@@ ec@@ tur@@ ers from Naples are included , from Que@@ bec , Edinburgh , New York , Sa@@ o Paulo , Berlin or Bremen .
The vacation by the police of the Casino of the Frankfurt Go@@ e@@ the University is having repercussions throughout the world .
27@@ 8 prof@@ essors and teaching assi@@ stants of the Go@@ e@@ the University , but also of col@@ leg@@ es from all over Germany , Europe and North and South America are showing their solidarity with the prote@@ sting students on the West@@ end camp@@ us .
In a statement written in both German and English , they &quot; condemn &quot; the police action initiated by the executive committee .
University president Werner Müll@@ er-@@ Est@@ ler had the building sei@@ zed by students and assi@@ stant prof@@ essors on strike last week , because walls and objects of art had been bes@@ mir@@ ched .
Five students were hur@@ t in the action .
The material damage , the sign@@ atories argue , does not justify &quot; the for@@ ceful dis@@ solution of self-@@ organised courses of students and lec@@ tur@@ ers by a police comm@@ ando unit &quot; .
The vacation represents &quot; an in@@ acceptable infringement &quot; on the freedom of research and teaching .
The exclusive focus on van@@ dali@@ sm serves &quot; to deli@@ gi@@ tim@@ ise and crimin@@ alise the protest &quot; and di@@ stra@@ cts from the matter .
The executive committee has refused to enter into the necessary dis@@ course .
The teaching staff demand the immediate termination of the criminal prosec@@ ution .
The majority of the occup@@ i@@ ers did not support the damage to property , read the statement .
Pro@@ test legitim@@ ised
The youth ranks of the Ver@@ di Union and the German Association of Uni@@ ons are also showing their solidarity with the students .
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for their own future , says Ver@@ di State Youth Secretary Alexander Kl@@ ein .
H@@ esse &apos;s Science Minister E@@ va Küh@@ ne-@@ Hör@@ mann ( CD@@ U ) , however , supported the approach of the university president and police .
We are grateful to the university president .
Dest@@ ru@@ ction and occupation are absolutely in@@ acceptable means , the said in a topical session on Thursday in the Wies@@ baden parliament .
We have sympathy for the protest , but cannot accept van@@ dali@@ sm , said the CD@@ U parliament member Peter Be@@ u@@ th .
A different stance was taken by the opposition parties - the SP@@ D , Greens and Left Party .
The CD@@ U is taking bes@@ mir@@ ched walls as the pretext to crimin@@ alise the protest , said Jan@@ ine Wis@@ s@@ ler ( Left Party ) .
Instead of taking the students &apos; arguments and students seriously , they organised this vacation .
The Left Party has filed an application calling on the Minister of Internal Affairs to report on the police action .
A new Sili@@ con Valley
For many years , it was a secret city , in@@ accessible to West@@ ern@@ ers .
Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d , one of ten districts in the capital Moscow , was a highly guar@@ ded location for secret arms research during the Soviet Union .
Nowadays , the municipality with its 2@@ 16@@ ,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia &apos;s Sili@@ con Valley .
Import@@ ant research and production facilities for mic@@ ro and n@@ ano technology are located here .
In September 2008 , representatives of Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Rie@@ d@@ berg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre ( F@@ I@@ Z ) .
There were several visits , and on Wednesday Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d and Rie@@ d@@ berg finally signed a &quot; protocol for closer cooperation &quot; in Frankfurt on Wednesday .
The Moscow Dep@@ uty Mayor , Y@@ ur@@ i Ros@@ ly@@ ak , and Pre@@ fect An@@ at@@ ol@@ y S@@ mir@@ no@@ v of Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Ed@@ win Schwar@@ z signed on behalf of Frankfurt .
In 2010 representatives of the F@@ I@@ Z and small@@ - and medium-sized companies focusing on research in natural science will travel to Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d for a seminar .
Scientific exchange
The idea is to establish continuous scientific exchange .
But business relations are also being e@@ yed .
Companies of the F@@ I@@ Z will have the option to get a foo@@ th@@ old in the growing Russian market .
In turn , Russian businesses want to win orders in Germany .
Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies .
These include , for instance , the Moscow Institute of Elec@@ trop@@ hy@@ si@@ cs , and major companies such as Sit@@ ron@@ ics and Ro@@ ssi@@ y@@ sk@@ aya Elektron@@ ika .
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called &quot; socialist planned city &quot; for arms research .
Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d ( verb@@ ati@@ m &quot; green city &quot; ) got its name from the woo@@ ded hills where the research facilities are located .
A Stuttgart bra@@ ke block
The impact and dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be over@@ estimated .
For its supporters , the project deals no less than with the &quot; new heart of Europe &quot; .
Quite rightly so . S@@ 21 is far more than lower@@ ing a railway station , more than a gigan@@ tic construction project , which will pl@@ unge the city of the Baden-@@ Wür@@ ttem@@ berg state capital into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade .
Stuttgart 21 war@@ n born out of the spirit of the 1980s .
Termin@@ us stations with ra@@ ils ending in the middle of towns were regarded as fossi@@ ls of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology , which acted like bra@@ ke blocks to contemporary rail traffic , as it used to take an aw@@ ful lot of time to shift engines from back to front .
P@@ ull in , stop briefly , pull out - that &apos;s the plan .
And therefore , termin@@ us stations were supposed to disappear : as in Frankfurt and Munich .
And in Stuttgart : a non-@@ termin@@ us station , which is approximately half way along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest / B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va - hence the s@@ logan of the &quot; heart of Europe &quot; .
S@@ 21 is actually being built now , although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the reality for years .
Even very ambitious plann@@ ers have recognised that it is virtually un@@ pay@@ able to lower the stations in the capit@@ als of H@@ esse and Bavaria .
Termin@@ us stations also no longer have pul@@ ling in and out problems since the development of pus@@ h-@@ pull trains with railway tra@@ ction units and control cab@@ s at either end .
And still : Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ul@@ m is now being started .
State and municipal politicians have enforced it .
German Rail is participating , also because the risks of the Republic &apos;s biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpa@@ yer and not the state company .
As regards urban development , the development can be more or less justified .
An urban area is being created which , if the plann@@ ers &apos; computer@@ -@@ generated graphics are to be believed , will feature a lot of green .
For the rail traffic system , S@@ 21 is damaging .
The non-@@ termin@@ us railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transportation , which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth .
At the time , there was no competition from no-@@ fri@@ ll@@ s airlines .
Con@@ temporary traffic policy , however , should be priori@@ ti@@ sing the handling of freight transportation , as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lor@@ ry on the road .
But the line to be built is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes .
More seriously , S@@ 21 also affects many other rail projects .
A good six billion euros are to be bu@@ ried in the Sw@@ ab@@ ian land .
That is the official figure .
Exper@@ ts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic .
One thing is for sure , the money will be missing at other no@@ des and bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks in the network over the next decade .
A total of six@@ ty major projects are on the list of the transport mini@@ stry .
One of the most important ones is to expand the some 180 km of the line through the Rhine valley .
Work has been continuing on the line in slow motion since 1987 .
It is urgent to really put the foot down here .
But S@@ 21 will act as a bra@@ ke block .
The Rhine valley line will become a bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for international freight transportation : right in the heart of Europe .
Government re@@ viewing verdi@@ ct on airport
The state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the verdi@@ ct of H@@ esse &apos;s Administ@@ rative Court ( V@@ G@@ H ) to ban night flights .
The CD@@ U / F@@ DP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400 + -@@ page V@@ G@@ H verdi@@ ct , said economics minister Di@@ eter Po@@ sch ( F@@ DP ) .
The V@@ G@@ H in Kas@@ sel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to re@@ organise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned nor@@ thwest run@@ way at Frankfurt Airport .
According to the verdi@@ ct , the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am , as planned by the state government , is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law .
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdi@@ ct .
The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administ@@ rative Court in Leipzig .
SP@@ D party leader Tor@@ sten Schä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel demanded the CD@@ U and F@@ DP to return to their promises to ban night flights , which they made before the election . Otherwise , this would have to be rated as the &quot; breaking of a promise &quot; .
It is bloo@@ dy difficult when you are allowed to keep one &apos;s word , said Greens leader T@@ are@@ k Al-@@ Wa@@ zi@@ r , all@@ u@@ ding to the F@@ DP election s@@ logan &quot; We keep our word &quot; .
Minister Po@@ sch rejected the accus@@ ation from Schä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by &quot; sk@@ e@@ wing justice and playing tri@@ cks &quot; .
A detailed legal examination would take time .
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of &quot; a brief first impression &quot; .
We need a legally compli@@ ant decision , said Stefan Müller ( F@@ DP ) .
As presented by the opposition , his party never made any statements regarding the ban on night flights .
US banks re@@ pay state support
The cri@@ si@@ s-@@ hit US major banks are breaking free from their state sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es .
On Wednesday Bank of America re@@ paid the support from the bank protection fund T@@ AR@@ P in the amount USD 45 billion ( nearly EUR 30 billion ) in one go .
And , according to reports from US broad@@ cast@@ er CN@@ BC , C@@ iti@@ group is also planning to re@@ pay the state support .
The institutions thereby want to wi@@ ggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand@@ -in-@@ hand with the acceptance of the money , such as the limits on manager bon@@ uses and the paying of high charges .
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through con@@ verti@@ ble loans .
The rest of the amount was taken from its own kit@@ ty , which was well filled through the sale of business units .
Bank head Kenn@@ eth Le@@ wis extended his express thanks to the American taxpa@@ yer on Wednesday evening : The cash injection helped over a very difficult time .
The bank over@@ stret@@ ched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch .
C@@ iti@@ group also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its li@@ abilities with the state .
Already on Thursday , the US bank was able to announce a capital increase of some USD 20 billion , reported CN@@ BC with reference to circles .
A C@@ iti@@ group spo@@ kes@@ man dec@@ lined to comment .
Gold@@ man Sach@@ s , J@@ P Morgan Ch@@ ase and Morgan Stan@@ ley had already re@@ paid their support in June .
A quick choice
It all happened a lot faster than expected .
B@@ are@@ ly two weeks after the Z@@ DF board of directors had pushed the acting edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief Nikol@@ aus B@@ render out of office , the broad@@ cast@@ er is able to present his successor .
Yesterday evening , the committee wanted to vote on the appointment .
The favourite was Peter Fre@@ y , head of Z@@ DF &apos;s main studio in Berlin .
But Z@@ DF did not confirm this - officially , not to anticip@@ ate the process .
However , the plan not to further damage Z@@ DF director Markus Sch@@ äch@@ ter , if this suggestion were also not successful with the board of directors , will also have played its part .
Fre@@ y , Sch@@ äch@@ ter &apos;s candidate , needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members .
The result of the vote was not known when going to press .
Two weeks ago Sch@@ äch@@ ter had been un@@ successful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the agreement with Nikol@@ aus B@@ render by another five years .
Only seven members voted for B@@ render , seven were against him . B@@ render &apos;s voting out was a severe blow to Sch@@ äch@@ ter , albeit one to be expected .
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative board had sign@@ aled already weeks before the vote that they would not confirm B@@ render in office .
Rol@@ and Ko@@ ch , the prime minister of H@@ esse , had organised the opposition to the edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief .
With the argument that Z@@ DF &apos;s news broad@@ casts had lost vie@@ wers under B@@ render , he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief .
Until shortly before the election , there were therefore protests in which the exerc@@ ising of political influence on the Z@@ DF was cas@@ tig@@ ated .
Most recently , 35 civil rights campaign@@ ers had even joined the debate and rated the actions of Ko@@ ch to be in breach of the Constitution .
To no av@@ ail .
Personal details
Peter Fre@@ y was born on 4 August 1957 in B@@ ingen .
He studied political and educational sciences and Rom@@ ance studies .
He later worked for the Süd@@ west@@ funk and the Frankfurter Rund@@ schau .
In 1983 Fre@@ y moved to the Z@@ DF , initially to the heu@@ te-@@ journ@@ al .
Sub@@ sequent activities : From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief ; in 1991 / 92 correspon@@ dent in Washington ; until 1998 head and present@@ er of the Mor@@ gen@@ magaz@@ in ; until 2001 head of Z@@ DF foreign affairs ; then head of the Z@@ DF head studio .
The Greens announced after the voting out of B@@ render , who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin only on Wednesday , to press constitutional charges .
Ko@@ ch &apos;s oppon@@ ent on the board of directors , the R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine prime minister Kur@@ t B@@ eck , explained last week that the states should amend the Z@@ DF treaty to the extend that staff suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority .
However , B@@ eck too ruled out any removal of party politicians from the boards of directors of the Z@@ DF .
B@@ render &apos;s expected successor , Peter Fre@@ y , had recommended himself to the board of directors with a cle@@ ver move - by har@@ sh@@ ly critic@@ ising the committee immediately after it voted out B@@ render .
Thanks to this proof of edi@@ torial independence , both Sch@@ äch@@ ter without losing face and the board of directors were able to vote for his appointment as edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief , without being suspec@@ ted of promoting a parti@@ san to this post .
In party calculations , Fre@@ y is reck@@ oned to be a left-@@ le@@ an@@ ing liberal anyway .
University courses to be cle@@ ared out
Par@@ tial success for students : After a year of educational strikes , the culture ministers of the states finally came around on Thursday : At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Princip@@ als Conference , both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for b@@ ach@@ el@@ or and masters courses .
The students should , in the future , be in a position to master their studies .
In particular , they agreed to reduce the number of exam@@ s : Every module shall , as a rule , be completed with one single ex@@ am .
In addition , the students &apos; work@@ load shall be reviewed and &quot; a realistic and acceptable extent &quot; ensured .
Poli@@ ti@@ cians and col@@ leg@@ es also want to simplify the recognition of exam@@ s taken between the col@@ leg@@ es inside and outside Germany .
The states undertake to organise more flexi@@ bly joint structural requirements for b@@ ach@@ el@@ or and masters courses .
State regulations devi@@ ating from this , shall not be imposed .
L@@ ess exam@@ s
Since the start of the student protests in June , culture ministers and university princip@@ als have been referring to the dict@@ um of better studi@@ ability .
Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time .
The so-called accredi@@ tation council has decided to , in part , dramatically reduce the number of exam@@ s : &quot; Every module ends , as a rule , with an ex@@ am , &quot; states the 30-@@ page paper , which is to newly go@@ vern the admission of courses in part .
With the &quot; clear reduction of the examination load &quot; , explains accredi@@ tation council chairman Rein@@ hold Gri@@ mm , &quot; an un@@ desirable development is to be stopped , which had a grave impact on studi@@ ability &quot; .
In addition , &quot; studi@@ ability &quot; is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the future .
Mod@@ ules and contents &quot; shall be strictly reviewed &quot; as to whether &quot; unnecessary con@@ stri@@ ctions on the students in their choice of
events &quot; would be avoided .
The students are &quot; entitled to be granted le@@ e@@ way allowing and promoting initiative &quot; .
The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses .
They need to be &quot; re@@ accredi@@ ted &quot; every five years , which , however , means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed .
Ten accredi@@ tation agencies throughout Germany over@@ see this , which report to the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Council set up by the states .
The culture ministers had &quot; expressly &quot; urged the states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exam@@ s regime not too strict .
In some federal states , universities and col@@ leg@@ es have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state mini@@ stries .
R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process ; so far , it is the only state to do so .
With this money , the col@@ leg@@ es are , in particular , to set up tut@@ or programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exam@@ s and foreign offices .
The state and col@@ leg@@ es plan to ear@@ mark 10 million euros for this .
In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the Universi@@ ties Act before parliament .
According to it , only one ex@@ am should be necessary to complete a course model .
The course design is to become more flexible , while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses .
By the end of the coming year , all courses of the state are to be examined for their studi@@ ability .
The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday .
On top of praise , there was also criticism for the decisions .
The federal board of the Young Socialist University Gro@@ ups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place &quot; behind the closed doors &quot; of ministers and university princip@@ als .
After the educational strike , at the latest , students should now also &quot; have their say &quot; as those affected .
The future academ@@ ics received support from the president of the Conference of University Princip@@ als ( HR@@ K ) , Mar@@ gre@@ t Winter@@ man@@ tel : &quot; We need the experiences of the students , &quot; she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers , with whom the HR@@ K was debating a joint reform paper .
The Education and Science Union ( G@@ EW ) deemed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough : It is demanding a legal claim , which would allow every graduate with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or degree admission on a further masters course .
On the other hand , the states must ensure that for the current generation of b@@ ach@@ el@@ or students there are sufficient places on master courses with best-@@ possible studying conditions , says G@@ EW executive board member Andreas Keller .
The states must employ significantly more lec@@ tur@@ ers .
The culture ministers did , however , not issue a statement regarding free admission to masters courses .
More than a foot@@ note to Her@@ ta Müller
Go@@ ing in and out of Germany is nice , virtually no checks ... &quot; is the first line of a po@@ em by the po@@ et Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner , in which he describes in distur@@ bing frag@@ ments a dis@@ sident &apos;s experience of arrival , who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area .
Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner , born in Romania &apos;s Ban@@ at in 195@@ 1 , initially worked as a German and English teacher in Buch@@ arest and later as an editor in a children &apos;s publishing house , before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982 .
S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner has won several literature awards , in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Po@@ etry Re@@ ad@@ ings at the Go@@ e@@ the University , and since 2002 he has been head of the H@@ esse Liter@@ ature Forum in the M@@ ous@@ on Tower in Frankfurt .
He caused a major extra@@ -@@ literary sti@@ r last Tuesday during a conference in Munich , debating &quot; German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securit@@ ate files &quot; .
Clearly un@@ settled and embar@@ ras@@ sed , S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner read out a statement , in which he admitted before Roman@@ o-@@ German writer colleagues , i.e. Richard Wag@@ ner , William Tot@@ ok , Franz Ho@@ d@@ j@@ ak and Hel@@ mu@@ th Frau@@ endor@@ fer , his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service , Securit@@ ate .
Jo@@ in@@ tly with some of those present , S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner 1989 had received the German language award in 1989 .
The recruitment attempts started gradually , first in 1971 .
I am , S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner concluded , &quot; therefore someone , who did not put up enough resistance to the intim@@ id@@ ation attempts of the Securit@@ ate . &quot;
The ly@@ ri@@ c@@ ist Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner is IM Walter .
Vir@@ tually at the same time as the awar@@ ding of the Nobel prize for Her@@ ta Müller and her un@@ matched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictator@@ ships , the literary scene and , in particular , the community of German authors with Romanian roots is being sho@@ cked by a case which reveals the dark spots and per@@ fi@@ dy of a political system based on control and sp@@ ying .
Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner is , in@@ as@@ much as can be said on the basis of the current knowledge , not only a perpet@@ r@@ ator , but also a victim .
In his Securit@@ ate file , IM Walter played a part , said after S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner &apos;s conf@@ ession the literary schol@@ ar Michael Mark@@ el and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him .
He &quot; bo@@ xed him out &quot; in all points which were dangerous for him at the time , said Mark@@ el .
He has a moral need to make this statement .
S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner &apos;s statement was in this form unexpected before this audience , although the conf@@ ession of a former dis@@ sident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising .
Germany was a cosy habit@@ at for the Security sp@@ ies , as Her@@ ta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file , 9@@ 14 pages .
Those affected , one can assume , will have gu@@ essed and in some cases even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sor@@ in , Vo@@ ic@@ u and , of course , Walter .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to the now very secure process of viewing St@@ asi files in Germany , the approach to the legacy of Securit@@ ate control is still very diff@@ use .
A systematic clarification has been undermined and hin@@ dered in recent years .
A National Council to Process Securit@@ ate Files ( S@@ N@@ SA@@ S ) , which is comparable to the Bir@@ th@@ ler Authority , was only set up in 1999 , but the release of the files has been very slow .
A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005 .
The fact that the influence of former Securit@@ ate members is still very big in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Her@@ ta Müller by an interview , in which a former Securit@@ ate head from Tim@@ iso@@ ara spoke in dero@@ g@@ atory terms of the prize winner .
They is psycho@@ tic , she was , after all , ques@@ tioned more than once .
The in@@ fam@@ y of power believed it could openly speak in the gu@@ ise of freedom of speech .
The S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner case does , as so often in connection with silent gu@@ ilt , raise questions .
Why only now ? Who fell victim ? The le@@ vel-@@ headed reaction of the audience to S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner &apos;s statement gives rise to the hope that a continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for information than f@@ ing@@ er-@@ pointing and shame .
Regarding the gene@@ sis of Her@@ ta Müller &apos;s oeu@@ vre , who yesterday received the Nobel prize , it is more than a foot@@ note .
The Champ@@ ions League - a side dish
It seemed as if a well-@@ dres@@ sed field sales representative was just coming from a very nice Christmas party , where a sports items manufacturer had handed out goo@@ dies , when the new V@@ f@@ B coach Christian Gro@@ ss in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier got in a called out Merce@@ des C class at a quarter past mid@@ night . ¨
The man with the striking bald head was still nee@@ ding a ch@@ au@@ ffe@@ ur , as the town was still unknown to him .
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all , no alcohol was involved and the 5@@ 5-@@ year-old was not dr@@ un@@ k .
A nice evening , but tomorrow the work would continue .
Or only just get going .
In the words of the Swiss national , who had only just been employed three days before : &quot; We may have reached the last six@@ teen , &quot; i.e. in the Champ@@ ions League thanks to a 3 : 1 win over Uni@@ rea Ur@@ zi@@ cen@@ i from Romania , &quot; but we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t be blin@@ ded by the success : We are in for a brutal fight against re@@ leg@@ ation . &quot;
The &quot; far more important task &quot; is scheduled for Sunday .
The Champ@@ ions League performance will have to be repeated in the day-to-day job of the le@@ ague .
And the again revealed weaknesses after the three quick goals by Mar@@ ica ( 5 . ) , Trä@@ sch ( 8 . ) and Po@@ gre@@ b@@ ny@@ ak ( 11 . ) will have to be stopped .
Dra@@ w
The last six@@ teen of the Champ@@ ions League ( first leg 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / second leg 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March ) will be drawn in Ny@@ on on 18 December .
The joy over the excellent start of the Bab@@ bel successor therefore remained mu@@ te .
Not only with the apparent sa@@ vi@@ our , who had given the un@@ settled Stuttgart professionals self-@@ confidence , commitment and joy in playing in a short period of time .
&quot; I addressed the players and told them that they must consider their strengths , and urged them to be more coura@@ geous , &quot; explained shr@@ ink Gro@@ ss his so simp@@ le-@@ sound@@ ing recip@@ e for success , which no longer had any effect under therap@@ ist Bab@@ bel .
He set a certain magic ali@@ ght , admitted Bab@@ bel fan Leh@@ mann , &quot; When now impul@@ ses are given in football , things happen which are considered to be impossible &quot; .
And Sam@@ i K@@ he@@ di@@ ra , who became the man of the match thanks to his dynamic approach having been injured for weeks , tried to describe the &quot; phenomenon &quot; with the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al &quot; bre@@ ath of fresh air &quot; and the work approach of the new bo@@ ss : &quot; He is a man who takes dra@@ stic measures and demands discipline .
That is what we need in the current situation . &quot;
Under Ba@@ bel this was clearly lacking .
V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart is still not out of the woods , war@@ ns sports director Hor@@ st Hel@@ dt
But V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart needs , more than anything , consistency .
Like Gro@@ ss , players and managers were e@@ ager not to over@@ estimate the win over the de@@ ple@@ ted and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly over@@ bur@@ dened defence of the Romanian guests .
They had also won in Glas@@ go@@ w before the horri@@ bly aw@@ ak@@ ening three days later in L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en in the 0 : 4 , warned K@@ he@@ di@@ ra .
And sports director Hor@@ st Hel@@ dt pointed out that one aim of the season had been achieved , but that the other one was still a long way off .
We are not out of the woods yet .
The fact that Hel@@ dt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40@@ th birthday and even on the first home win for three months , had to do with the events of the weekend , which were revi@@ ved in the form of a TV interview with go@@ al@@ keep@@ er J@@ ens Leh@@ mann , which was scre@@ ened immediately before the match .
There are decisions which other people take and not J@@ ens , was Hel@@ dt &apos;s response to Leh@@ mann &apos;s harsh criticism .
He had accused the directors of a lack of leadership , who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pu@@ bes@@ cent fans .
The fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled , was also rated by Leh@@ mann as a sign of a lack of authority and res@@ ent@@ ment .
Leh@@ mann &apos;s statements were &quot; guided by pure e@@ go@@ ism &quot; , rep@@ lied Hel@@ dt and announced consequences for the keep@@ er .
It is unlikely they will become friends for life .
But , after all , they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of co@@ aches , the strong performance , both in terms of play and spirit , would not have been possible .
Ba@@ bel and seine assi@@ stants had &quot; a great share in the success &quot; , said Hel@@ dt and Leh@@ mann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed .
World@@ cup heav@@ y@@ weight box match
He@@ ated du@@ el in Ber@@ ne : Challen@@ ger Kev@@ in John@@ son kept provo@@ king world champion Vit@@ ali Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko with words and gest@@ ures .
But after twelve hard rounds , the Ukrainian defended his heav@@ y@@ weight title according to the W@@ BC .
The verdi@@ ct of the judges was unanimous .
Hamburg - Vit@@ ali Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko remains heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xing world champion .
On Saturday night in Ber@@ ne the 3@@ 8-@@ year-old champion ( the W@@ BC association version , ) beat the American Kev@@ in John@@ son unanimously by points ( 120 : 108 , 120 : 108 , 1@@ 19 : 10@@ 9 ) .
For Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko this was his third successful defence of his title since his com@@ eb@@ ack in October 2008 .
Before , the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the W@@ B@@ O and W@@ BC associations .
Unfortunately , the kno@@ ck-@@ out , which everybody had expected , did not materi@@ alise .
Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches , twice he had to give in due to injury .
Challen@@ ger John@@ son saw his first defeat in 24 fi@@ ghts .
In front of some 17@@ ,000 spec@@ t@@ ators in the Ber@@ ne Arena , the 2.@@ 0@@ 2-@@ met@@ re t@@ all Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko aimed to dict@@ ate the match predomin@@ antly with his left hit@@ ting hand .
But the ele@@ ven cen@@ timet@@ res shorter John@@ son , how had announced the end of the Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko era before the fight , kept ev@@ ading the h@@ its from the world champion , meaning that Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko was not able to apply a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand .
Overall , the passive John@@ son did not do enough for a challen@@ ger and simply tried to survive the rounds .
Although he provo@@ ked Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko with words and gest@@ ures , his blo@@ ws only rarely hit the world champion .
Nevertheless , he is only the second bo@@ xed since Tim@@ o Hoff@@ mann in 2000 who fight the full twelve rounds against Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko .
The challen@@ ger had caused quite a sti@@ r in the Swiss capital before the fight .
He insul@@ ted Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko as &quot; an ug@@ ly z@@ om@@ bie &quot; , who &quot; cannot do anything at all &quot; .
During weigh@@ ing , the champion then allowed himself to be provo@@ ked to kno@@ ck John@@ son &apos;s s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses of his nose &quot; to be able to see into his eyes . &quot;
Four@@ th victory after Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s return
Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko came out on top in his fourth fight since his com@@ eb@@ ack on 11 October 2008 .
After a sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal nearly four years , he beat the Nig@@ eri@@ an Samu@@ el Peter in Berlin and reg@@ a@@ ined &quot; his &quot; W@@ BC belt , which he had been forced to hand over before without a fight .
This year he then beat in the defence of his title the Cuban Juan Carlos Gom@@ ez from and Chris Ar@@ re@@ ola from the US in September .
I only took one blow in this fight , and am physi@@ cally in very good shape , Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko said after the quick return to the ring .
His dream , however , remains the unification of all important titles in his family .
Bro@@ ther V@@ ladimir is world champion of the W@@ B@@ O and IB@@ F associations .
But the W@@ BA belt is worn by Brit@@ an David Ha@@ ye after he de@@ th@@ ron@@ ed the 2.@@ 13@@ -@@ met@@ re t@@ all Nikol@@ ay Valu@@ e@@ v in November .
Ha@@ ye had previously cancelled in the summer a fight planned to take place in September against Vit@@ ali Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko .
Appar@@ ently , his promotion company is now already planning a fight against Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko at London &apos;s W@@ em@@ ble@@ y stadium .
The Kun@@ du@@ z case
Fron@@ tal attack from the opposition : Green party head Jür@@ gen T@@ rit@@ tin calls defence minister Gut@@ ten@@ berg a li@@ ar for providing false information on the Kun@@ du@@ z affair .
SP@@ D and Left Party demanding a clarification from the Chancellor .
Hamburg / Berlin - After the recent re@@ vel@@ ations regarding the air raid of Kun@@ du@@ z , the opposition has accused defence minister Kar@@ l-@@ The@@ od@@ or zu Gut@@ ten@@ berg ( CS@@ U ) of deliber@@ ate dec@@ eption .
The minister apparently made &quot; kno@@ w@@ ingly false statements &quot; regarding the fat@@ al bom@@ bing of two tank tra@@ ilers in September , said Green party head Jür@@ gen T@@ rit@@ tin on Saturday in the AR@@ D news programme Tages@@ schau .
This is generally referred to as lying .
The order to kill was given in de@@ fi@@ ance of the rules of the International Security Assi@@ stance Force ( IS@@ A@@ F ) for Afghanistan .
That is the substance of the report , which NATO had , which Mr. Gut@@ ten@@ berg has read , said T@@ rit@@ tin .
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the ab@@ duc@@ ted tan@@ kers , but also to specifically kill two Tal@@ eb@@ an leaders .
The US air strike ordered by the German Kun@@ du@@ z comm@@ ander Col@@ on@@ el Kl@@ ein , up to 142 people were killed of injured , according to the NATO inquiry report .
The Greens , SP@@ D and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Gut@@ ten@@ berg really knew about the event .
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government &apos;s Afghanistan policy , and whether the Chancellor &apos;s Office , German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy , demanded Jür@@ gen T@@ rit@@ tin and his Greens colleague Ren@@ ate Kün@@ ast .
Government spo@@ kes@@ man Ul@@ rich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resol@@ utely .
The Chancellor &apos;s Office did not take any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan , he said .
On Saturday , doubts over the presentation by the mini@@ stry of the background of the dis@@ miss@@ al of In@@ spec@@ tor General Wolfgang Schnei@@ der@@ han and State Secretary Peter Wich@@ ert emerged .
According to information available to SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL , the two provided Gut@@ ten@@ berg with correct and complete information on the background of the tan@@ ker tra@@ iler attack .
Off@@ ici@@ ally , it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister .
From the ent@@ ou@@ rage of the top official , however , it was said that the defence mini@@ stry had even been directed to several reports , including a two-@@ page documents of the comm@@ anding colon@@ el Kl@@ ein and a report from the military police .
In the meantime , Wich@@ ert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter , reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonn@@ tags@@ zei@@ tung .
He has not received a response , it is claimed .
The mini@@ stry did not comment on the accus@@ ations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament , which would be set up next Wednesday .
Dre@@ am worlds
Some see images and hear voices when they are awa@@ ke which others do not hear or see .
Not only in the ment@@ ally sick and during in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become bl@@ urred .
As long as this happens in sleep , things are fine .
When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed , we can sur@@ render to the wild@@ est imagin@@ ations and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es without restra@@ int .
But anybody experiencing dre@@ am-@@ like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awa@@ ke , is regarded in contemporary Western society as a ma@@ d@@ man or drug addi@@ ct , or strange at the very least .
But such images and voices are formed not only in the ment@@ ally sick or during drug in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
This is down to our imagination : The same neu@@ ral processes which allow us to design houses , draw paintings or write no@@ vels can make the borders between dream , ma@@ dness and reality become bl@@ urred .
Con@@ sci@@ ous conditions which are war@@ ped like dreams can occur in the most different forms , in the best case we call them vi@@ sions , in the worst case ma@@ dness .
Even if their trig@@ gers and effects may differ , the vi@@ sions of my@@ stic Hil@@ de@@ g@@ ard von B@@ ingen , the drug experiences of New Age pro@@ ph@@ et Carlos Cast@@ ane@@ da , sh@@ am@@ an deta@@ ch@@ ment from reality conditions , psycho@@ ses and hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations can be tra@@ ced back to similar processes .
H@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ ination or del@@ u@@ sions occur when the balance of the neu@@ ral trans@@ mit@@ ters of the brain - predomin@@ antly dop@@ am@@ ine nor@@ ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ ch@@ ol@@ ine - der@@ ails and the interaction of different brain segments is dy@@ s@@ functional .
Comple@@ x hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and del@@ u@@ sional thoughts often occur during sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic psycho@@ ses .
Gra@@ vity no longer has any power over him
The connection between ma@@ dness and dream has occupied philosoph@@ ers and doctors since ancient times .
A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le understood hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations to be a form of dream while awa@@ ke , Wilhelm Gri@@ es@@ inger , a founder of modern psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , detected in 18@@ 61 a &quot; huge simil@@ arity of ma@@ dness and dre@@ am@@ like conditions &quot; , for Sig@@ mund Freu@@ d dreams were even &quot; a psycho@@ sis , with all pu@@ zz@@ les , del@@ u@@ sions and mis@@ perc@@ ep@@ tions of such &quot; .
It is autumn 2001 when H@@ enn@@ ing T. turns into a com@@ ic figure .
His body is two-@@ dimensional and exc@@ essively gau@@ dy .
Gra@@ vity no longer has any power over him , he flo@@ ats at the ceiling of the room .
He feels a k@@ ick .
Beh@@ ind him are wing@@ ed devi@@ lish figures with red , distor@@ ted faces , s@@ nar@@ ling .
They hun@@ t him , k@@ ick him with heavy , fl@@ aming bo@@ ots , throw him against walls , he feels the pain all over his body .
Lou@@ d , evil voices emerge from the walls and radio .
He can no longer stand them , the voices that abuse and insu@@ lt him .
H@@ enn@@ ing T. pul@@ ls two c@@ ables out of the ster@@ eo system , ties them to a k@@ not and atta@@ ches it to a ho@@ ok on the ceiling .
He clim@@ bs on a speaker and puts the no@@ ose around his neck .
He j@@ umps .
The no@@ ose becomes loose .
Let that be a lesson to you , the voices scre@@ am in an ear@@ dru@@ m-@@ te@@ aring cho@@ ir , &quot; go to the clin@@ ic and get treated ! &quot;
Today , H@@ enn@@ ing T. is 40 years old , he has had six acute psycho@@ ses , the last one is two years back , the first nearly 20 years ago .
It was caused by L@@ SD .
His diagnosis is a sch@@ iz@@ o@@ affec@@ tiv@@ e-@@ par@@ ano@@ id psycho@@ sis , he is also a man@@ ic-@@ de@@ pressive , he takes drugs against depression , the man@@ ia and sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
He has learned to live with his illness , he has been married for three years .
In psycho@@ sis I experienced the worst fear and deep@@ est desper@@ ation , he says .
The illu@@ sions are a brutal reality
About 1 per cent of the population suff@@ ers at least once in their lifetime from sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia ; in psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c clin@@ ics , it is treated with a frequency only second to depression .
In an acute sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic psycho@@ sis , people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world , they reach an over@@ exc@@ ited condition which can result in hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania , par@@ ano@@ ia or persecution man@@ ia .
Partic@@ ularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command , comment or involve in dialogue .
Visual hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are also not rare .
The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from un@@ important things , the brain can no longer filter out distur@@ bing signals , the conscious is floo@@ ded by impres@@ sions .
Like dreams , a psycho@@ sis also opens the floo@@ d@@ gates on a flood of ideas and ph@@ an@@ ta@@ si@@ es , which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious .
The perception of reality in a psycho@@ sis is subjec@@ t-@@ cent@@ red , says professor Thomas Fu@@ chs , senior physi@@ cian at the Clin@@ ic for General Psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at the University Clin@@ ic of Heidelberg .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients are at the heart of the events , the meaning of everything is directed to him .
At the same time , he finds himself in a passive role , he is , like in a dream , overwhel@@ med by the events can cannot affect them actively .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients therefore often feel threatened , controlled and manipul@@ ated .
A reality comparison is often not available to them , the illu@@ sions are a brutal reality , w@@ aking up is not possible .
To experience a hall@@ u@@ c@@ ination once in your life
Con@@ tr@@ ary to dreams , says Fu@@ chs , &quot; the sen@@ su@@ al and spati@@ al structure of reality , as perceived during a psycho@@ sis , remains in@@ tact as a rule &quot; .
The del@@ u@@ sional thoughts and hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are based in reality , the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality .
P@@ rec@@ isely why our brain plays such tri@@ cks on us , is still pu@@ zz@@ ling to scientists .
Extra@@ ordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time , says Fu@@ chs .
But not everybody will develop a psycho@@ sis .
There seems to be a genetic tendency to sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , but studies of tw@@ ins have shown that genes are not the sole factor .
Scienti@@ sts assume that patients have minimal brain damage .
We think that the ne@@ ur@@ onal mat@@ uring of the brain is distur@@ bed in an early stage of development , through a virus infection in the mother during pregn@@ ancy , for instance , explains Fu@@ chs .
But it remains a myst@@ ery how distur@@ ban@@ ces to the ne@@ ur@@ onal system comes about which also do not become mani@@ fest for many years initially .
Environmental imp@@ acts also play a part - stress or trau@@ matic experiences can trigger psycho@@ ses if the dis@@ position is given .
H@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ gen drugs can trigger psycho@@ ses , as they interfere with the trans@@ mit@@ ter system .
When our brain runs hot
The mad thing is that psycho@@ tics suffer from their hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and take expensive medic@@ ation to get rid of them , others spend money on drugs to get the same , says Lü@@ be@@ ck-@@ based psych@@ ology professor E@@ rich Ka@@ sten .
Whether these illu@@ sions are perceived to be pleasant or un@@ pleasant is often only a matter of perspective .
Ka@@ sten has been collecting reports for ten years on hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and del@@ u@@ sions ; last year he assessed his results in a book ti@@ tled The un@@ real World in our Head .
H@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are a typical by-@@ product of psycho@@ ses , but also of a remark@@ ably large amount of other diseases .
These include , on top of mental ill@@ nesses such as bor@@ der@@ line or depression , also often diseases such as mig@@ ra@@ ine , ep@@ ile@@ p@@ sy , multiple sc@@ ler@@ o@@ sis or Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease and trau@@ matic brain inj@@ uries .
Sur@@ pris@@ ingly , even the brain of healthy people hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ates under certain conditions .
H@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , says Ka@@ sten , consist of memory frag@@ ments , which are often held back .
They occur when areas of the brain , where sens@@ ory perc@@ ep@@ tions are processed , are over@@ active or not sufficiently restra@@ ined ; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stim@@ ulation .
Dru@@ gs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psycho@@ sis .
But sens@@ ory de@@ priv@@ ation , stress , lo@@ ve@@ si@@ ckness or other mental exceptional conditions too .
In more recent studies , up to one third of respon@@ dents claimed to have experienced a hall@@ u@@ c@@ ination at least once in their lives .
In summer 2005 Sar@@ ah K. is 16 years old , she is living in a small town in Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg-@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern and goes to the local secondary school .
Indeed , a perfectly normal girl .
It it were not for the images and voices .
During breaks , it can happen that a lan@@ ky boy with long dark hair approaches her .
When she answers him , her school@@ m@@ ates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or h@@ ears this boy .
They think the girls is a nut@@ ty day@@ dre@@ am@@ er , but Sar@@ ah K. is not dre@@ aming , she knows that much .
She is awa@@ ke , she sees and h@@ ears this boy , just like she sees and h@@ ears the girl at the desk next to her .
She can even feel his presence , at least for some moments .
A pleasant feeling it is , she likes the boy .
Am I mad ? she sometimes asks .
But she knows that this boy and the other illu@@ sions are not real and disappear again .
At night the appe@@ ar@@ ances are usually fri@@ gh@@ tening
The illu@@ sions are often a stra@@ in .
When she is sitting in the class@@ room , she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new school@@ m@@ ate , while she is expla@@ ining mathemati@@ cal equ@@ ations on the black@@ board for everyone else .
At night the appe@@ ar@@ ances are usually fri@@ gh@@ tening .
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room , which comes far too rarely and late , she often cannot distinguish whether she is awa@@ ke or already dre@@ aming , whether the images she sees , the gri@@ m@@ aces or the girl with the ble@@ eding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes .
Let me be , she scre@@ ams at the figures .
She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this , they would think she was mad .
Aut@@ umn 2009 . Sar@@ ah K. is 20 years old now .
She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boy@@ friend .
A year ago the hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations stopped .
Since she cont@@ acted psych@@ ologist Ka@@ sten via the internet , she knows exactly that she is not mad .
Mad@@ ness is also work of art born out of desper@@ ation
If someone is socially isolated or suff@@ ers from sens@@ ory de@@ priv@@ ation , he will very probably suffer from hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations after some time , says Ka@@ sten .
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment .
Sar@@ ah K. , a single child , was afraid of other children when she was small ; she often played alone .
Her hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father .
As during visual and acou@@ stic hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impres@@ sions and sounds , it is often difficult for patients like Sar@@ ah K. to distinguish between illu@@ sions and reality . &quot; Every experience , &quot; says Ka@@ sten , &quot; takes place in the brain , reality is re@@ produced there .
H@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are also images , which the brain creates , this is why they seem so real . &quot;
Illu@@ sions at night are also classified by Ka@@ sten as a form of hall@@ u@@ c@@ ination .
The hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psycho@@ sis .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ene patients , ment@@ ally healthy people are able to identify illu@@ sions as un@@ real .
Ka@@ sten therefore adv@@ ises his patients to appreciate hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations as a special ability .
B@@ order between dream and hall@@ u@@ c@@ ination
In our far too consci@@ ous@@ -@@ cent@@ red world , imagin@@ ary experiencing is often unfortunately path@@ olog@@ ised , says Michael Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ De@@ gen@@ hard , professor in Heidelberg and senior physi@@ cian of the Clin@@ ic for Psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry and Psy@@ cho@@ therapy of the Florence Ni@@ ght@@ ing@@ ale Hospital in Düsseldorf .
A psycho@@ sis is a severe , painful illness , but it also brings positive aspects , creativity - ma@@ dness is also a work of art born out of desper@@ ation .
Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ De@@ gen@@ hard has resear@@ ched the so-called on@@ ei@@ ro@@ id experience , a particular form of conscious conditions which are war@@ ped like dreams .
On@@ ei@@ ro@@ ids are highly complex , detailed quasi dreams , which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awa@@ ke .
The on@@ ei@@ ro@@ id condition occurs in trau@@ ma@@ - or si@@ ck@@ ness@@ -@@ related extreme situations , for instance in poly@@ radi@@ cu@@ li@@ tis patients , who experience a motor par@@ aly@@ sis in full consciousness .
If a person is threatened by sel@@ f@@ - or world loss , for instance due to persistent , complete loss of mobility , he re@@ places the life-@@ threatening real situation with an own , imagin@@ ary world , which is un@@ coupled from reality , says Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ De@@ gen@@ hard .
A kind of border between dream and hall@@ u@@ c@@ ination
As the ma@@ stering of a situation is not possible in reality , a change of world takes place , but the real situation is not updated in the imagination .
An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbe@@ ar@@ able situation , which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emp@@ tin@@ ess of a loss of consciousness .
Everything is real , even later in the memory
The Zu@@ rich@@ -based art hist@@ orian Peter Cor@@ ne@@ li@@ us Cl@@ aus@@ sen also describes his on@@ ei@@ ro@@ id experiences in his book A Change of Hear@@ t as the sole &apos;s attempt to safe itself .
He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on jour@@ neys for days after heart val@@ ve surgery with subsequent heart transplan@@ tation while his body is dam@@ ned to im@@ mobility in the intensive care unit .
Cl@@ aus@@ sen del@@ ves into a world of his creation , visits foreign places and times : He experiences himself as a bed@@ ri@@ dden , old man , on board a train san@@ atorium , a ro@@ bot watching over his health .
He lives in the early Middle A@@ ges amongst no@@ ble@@ men who make in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ants from blood .
He is ab@@ duc@@ ted by a Greek man on his motor@@ bike to his hom@@ eland , sur@@ fs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the ma@@ fia .
He is fully taken up with the imagin@@ ary events ; everything is real , even later in his memory .
These inner trips , Cl@@ aus@@ sen believes , are fundamentally different from every dream .
Dre@@ am is a different condition , he describes his experience .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to that , the memories from mental trips are over@@ tly clear to me even after years and in minute detail .
Even clearer and more intense that real events .
The intensity of this experience breaks the horiz@@ on of our day-to-day experiences , says psy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ De@@ gen@@ hard .
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , on@@ ei@@ ro@@ ids , psycho@@ ses , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and drug in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation show how fragile our images of the external reality are , even when awa@@ ke .
Every change to the conscious , sum@@ mar@@ ises psych@@ ologist Ka@@ sten , &quot; can result in a war@@ ping of what we call reality &quot; .
An experience which can indeed be enrich@@ ing .
The snow can come
Bur@@ da
Children set to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
K@@ allen , the new head of the publishing house , is an interim solution : In the long term , Hu@@ bert Bur@@ da wants his company to be taken over by his two children , he has told the SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL magazine .
The holding is to remain to 100 % in the family .
Hamburg - The publi@@ sher Hu@@ bert Bur@@ da sees the long-term future of his company in his children &apos;s hands .
Both children will inher@@ it at the age of 27 and are strongly intent on joining the company , the 6@@ 9-@@ year-old has told the SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL magazine .
The details have already been organised as a precau@@ tion .
The question whether they will be active in the company will only arise later .
Also the question whether they are able to do so .
One cannot put one &apos;s children in charge of 7,@@ 500 employees if they are not capable of this .
That will kill the children , and the company with them .
On Thursday , Bur@@ da announced that he would be re@@ signing from his post as chairman as of January and appointed Pau@@ l-@@ Bern@@ hard K@@ allen as his successor .
5@@ 2-@@ year-old K@@ allen has been a member of the board at Bur@@ da since 1999 .
He was initially responsible for technology .
Later , with the Treas@@ ury department , he assumed responsibility for the company assets , and after Jür@@ gen To@@ den@@ hö@@ fer &apos;s departure , also for direct marketing , foreign operations , print and finances .
For the first time , a person who is not a family member is thus at the hel@@ m of the publishing house .
Bur@@ da &apos;s children are 19 and 17 ; his son Feli@@ x , who would be 42 today , died a couple of years ago .
The appointment of K@@ allen is designed to &quot; bridge 10 , 15 years &quot; , says Bur@@ da .
The holding is to remain to 100 per cent in family ownership , said Bur@@ da .
In light of the cases of Schi@@ ck@@ e@@ dan@@ z and Sch@@ a@@ eff@@ ler , Bur@@ da stated that family-@@ owned companies are not safe from going under either : &quot; That always affected families who were infected with a capital addi@@ ction , who spec@@ ulated wron@@ g@@ ly and through they could advance to become a really big player .
That never was my strategy .
He never had &quot; dreams of world power &quot; , says Bur@@ da .
I do not see myself as a political prec@@ ep@@ tor of the country , as Sp@@ ring@@ er was , and I do not want to participate in the world le@@ ague with Time magazine , these companies have become too big .
Com@@ prehen@@ sive Beauty
Everything you could want in terms of beauty and comfort -@@ at your finger@@ tips .
This is what El Cor@@ te In@@ gl@@ és , which has just opened a multi@@ disciplinary space of more than 1,@@ 000@@ m2 dedicated to bo@@ dy@@ care and p@@ am@@ per@@ ing in the Cal@@ la@@ o ( Madrid ) shopping center , seems to be aiming for .
The spa , located on the eigh@@ th floor , houses prestigious firms like H@@ ed@@ on@@ ai , offering laser hair removal ; Spa@@ xi@@ ón , with relaxation and rooms for beauty treatment ; hair@@ dres@@ sers Lu@@ is &amp; T@@ ach@@ i ; Marina d &apos;@@ Or , which has a gym ; and L &apos;@@ Occ@@ it@@ ane and their natural co@@ sem@@ tics , among others .
There is also a food section , which features a te@@ as@@ hop with more than 130 different kinds of tea .
En@@ jo@@ ying a relaxing mas@@ age with your partner while you look out over the unbe@@ at@@ able views of the capital , or r@@ enting out the relax area for 2 hours to throw your own &apos; beauty party &apos; with eight of your friends and relaxing with a jacuzzi session , massages , and drinking a glass of champ@@ agne are just some of the possibilities Spa@@ xi@@ ón offers .
A total of 250 m2 are distributed amongst 12 rooms to carry out the latest and most innovative fac@@ ial , body and hydro@@ therapy treatments .
Such as , for example , c@@ av@@ itation to combat cell@@ uli@@ te , or vi@@ bration platforms .
The gym has these machines , in addition to virtual train@@ ers which guide the steps of the clients , offering them a totally personalized treatment .
Everything starts by entering your personal key on the touch screen situated in front of the machine .
Then , various videos show us how to properly perform our work@@ out plan .
Its director guarantees that 15 minutes ( including warm up and stret@@ ching ) are enough to exercise all of the mus@@ cles in the body .
And , if after our work@@ out we want to drop by the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s , Lu@@ is &amp; T@@ ach@@ i provides a salon where they offer personal hair services to restore its bri@@ l@@ liance and nutrition .
Innovation and exclu@@ si@@ vity seem to be the pre@@ mise of this urban spa , which will be open every day of the year , from 10 : 00 in the morning to 10 : 00 at night .

En@@ des@@ a and Barcelona with the electric car
The electric company En@@ des@@ a , together with Barcelona City Council , has created &apos; Office L@@ IVE . &apos; 
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catal@@ an capital .
Office L@@ IVE &apos; ( Log@@ istics for the Imple@@ mentation of the Electri@@ c V@@ eh@@ ic@@ le ) will define and coordinate the road@@ map for the implementation of the electric car in the city , and will define the conditions for mobility , management , coordination , present subsidies , etc .
Moreover , MO@@ V@@ EL@@ E will develop the project , promote the electric car , review public opinion and work from the sectors involved .
In short , it hopes to promote what will be the transportation of the future .
3 &apos; electric ci@@ ti@@ es@@ &apos;
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain .
Madrid and Seville are joining the project .
They are the three cities chosen by the Government to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle within the MO@@ V@@ EL@@ E plan .
The electric company En@@ des@@ a has already signed a framework agreement with the Gener@@ ali@@ tat of Catal@@ onia .
With that , it hopes to promote the activities of the Research and Techn@@ ological Development in the Autonom@@ ous Community of Catal@@ onia .
These include activities linked to energy and , in particular , energy efficiency .
It is not the only initiative En@@ des@@ a is involved in regarding the promotion of the electric vehicle .
The company particip@@ ates in standardi@@ zation groups at the European level and has a series of active complementary projects , such as G@@ 4@@ V , EL@@ V@@ IR@@ E and C@@ EN@@ IT VER@@ DE .
Zap@@ ater@@ o sees &apos; a horiz@@ on of peace &apos; for the automotive sector .
The Prime Minister , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez Zap@@ ater@@ o , cat@@ ches a gli@@ mp@@ se of &apos; a horiz@@ on of peace &apos; for the Spanish automotive industry , which , he pointed out , is the principal export sector in the country .
In the Prime Minister &apos;s presentation of the Economic Report for 2009 , Zap@@ ater@@ o reviewed the measures the government had launched throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector .
&quot; Without the Autom@@ otive Com@@ peti@@ tiveness Plan , today we would have a panorama of negle@@ ct and the closure of some of our major production plants , &quot; the Prime Minister explained .
&quot; Through this plan and the arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly competitive sector in Spain , we can have a horiz@@ on of peace for the future of this industry , which is our principal export sector , &quot; he added .
In this regard , he rec@@ alled that the@@ Com@@ peti@@ tiveness Plan , included in the Com@@ prehen@@ sive Plan of the Automob@@ ile Industry ( P@@ IA ) , allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary companies , which mobili@@ zed an investment of more than 3 billion euros .
The head of the Executive Bran@@ ch explained that this investment was committed as much to the development of new models as it was to upgra@@ ding already existing products and processes .
Zap@@ ater@@ o also stressed the government &apos;s measures to support the demand , all@@ u@@ ding to Plan 200@@ 0@@ E , implemented in collaboration with the Autonom@@ ous Communities and automotive brand .
According to the Prime Minister , this plan has reduced emissions by 6 % in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has brought about a &quot; sharp increase &quot; in en@@ roll@@ ment , which rose by &quot; 40 percent &quot; in November ..
20@@ ,000 square meters of classic vehicles .
The first year of the International Classic Car Show@@ room will be celebrated in Madrid , a meeting place for professionals and am@@ ate@@ urs of the motor world .
This initiative will take place from the 5th to the 7th of February , 2010 in the G@@ lass P@@ avi@@ lion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid .
This is a 20@@ ,000 square meter exhibition area , and more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be there .
Not only will you find classic motor@@ cycles and cars at Classi@@ c@@ Auto Madrid , there will also be all kinds of products related to the motor world .
So you will find the exhibitors at the pa@@ vi@@ lion displa@@ ying accessories , parts , components , textile accessories , comple@@ ments , publications , mini@@ atures , etc .
H@@ und@@ reds of items related to the world of classic mot@@ ors will delight collec@@ tors and the curi@@ ous .
Particip@@ ating companies will include Cl@@ á@@ si@@ cos de Mo@@ s and Good Old Times , automobile sales ; Juan Lum@@ br@@ eras , restoration ; Cou@@ pe-@@ Francisco Pu@@ e@@ che , automobile sales and restoration , and Co@@ cher Cl@@ á@@ si@@ cos , Merce@@ des B@@ enz specialists .

The business of this Show@@ room will also feature parallel activities : r@@ allies , sports exhibitions , tests of skill , presentations and competitions .
Tests of skill in classic cars and motor@@ cycles will also take place on an authorized track outside the exhibition site .
Maz@@ da@@ 3 i-@@ Stop : Sustain@@ able spor@@ ts@@ manship
Maz@@ da wants to show that spor@@ ts@@ manship is not in@@ compatible with the environment .
Therefore , Maz@@ da@@ 3 has just added an engine st@@ opping and starting system - du@@ b@@ bed as the i-@@ Stop - , a mechanism which is , for the moment at least , only available with the 15@@ 0-@@ horse power 2.0 pet@@ rol engine .
This second generation of the Maz@@ da@@ 3 stands out for its overall high ratings .
The fin@@ ishes , features , comfort , performance , mechan@@ ics , the i-@@ Stop system …
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Maz@@ da@@ 3 .
Starting with the driver &apos;s seat , we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonom@@ ics and support .
The feel of the ste@@ ering wheel is also exquisite .
Mo@@ ving on to th@@ ec@@ om@@ bin@@ ation of the d@@ ash@@ board and console , we see how Maz@@ da has continued the Japanese tendency to create a fut@@ ur@@ istic interior design with a great deal of buttons , kno@@ bs and striking red and blue colors .
This style remin@@ ds us , in part , of the Hon@@ da Civi@@ c .
So , we can say that the Maz@@ da@@ 3 and the Civi@@ c , both Japanese , contrast with the so@@ bri@@ ety of the German products , more specifically , the Volkswagen Golf , which everyone wants to beat .
Continu@@ ing with the interior , this Japanese compact is easily room@@ y enough for four adults to travel in great comfort .
All of this comes with a spacious trun@@ k and standard dimensions .
The engine &apos;s automatic st@@ opping and starting system , at least for now , is only available with the two-@@ li@@ ter , 15@@ 0-@@ hor@@ se-@@ power , manual , six-@@ gear , pet@@ rol engine .
This engine is a real deli@@ ght@@ .@@ What makes it outstanding are its sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty , reduced noise levels , features and fuel consumption .
And even though the diesel versions of the Mad@@ z@@ da@@ 3 will be in higher demand , those who don &apos;t do too much mile@@ age a year should not dis@@ miss this i-@@ Stop pet@@ rol engine system , both for its elev@@ ated driving comfort and its fuel consumption .
As regards the level of the equipment , the version chosen for the test is called the Spor@@ tive , meaning@@ it incorpor@@ ates a high number of standard elements .
The standard equipment is excellent , especially the lane changing assi@@ stant ( R@@ V@@ M ) which elimin@@ ates the blind spot , the tra@@ ction and stability controls , the speed control , the interior photo@@ sensitive mirror , the large-@@ screen on@@ board computer , the parking sensors , independent climate control , rain and lights sensor , Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio , and 17 &quot; allo@@ y wheels .
Additionally , with less equipment , this version comes with the Premium Pack , which , for 1,@@ 500 euros , also features : bi@@ -@@ x@@ enon adap@@ tive head@@ lights and a B@@ OS@@ E sound system with CD chan@@ ger , among other things .
Con@@ clu@@ sion
The Maz@@ da@@ 3 2.0 i-@@ Stop is one of the best comp@@ acts in its category .
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used , its performance , and the high standard of its equipment .
Additionally , those who do less y@@ early mile@@ age can opt for this version of the i-@@ Stop , associated only with the 15@@ 0-@@ hor@@ se-@@ power 2.0 engine .
The only draw@@ back of this model is its high price , which ranges from 2@@ 1,@@ 7@@ 70 euros for the Lux@@ ury pack to 23@@ ,@@ 2@@ 70 euros for the Spor@@ tive version , tested here .
In exchange for the high price , the Maz@@ da@@ 3 will offer a large daily dose of satisfaction .
Deluxe &apos; Premi@@ ere@@ &apos;
L. A. covers the red car@@ pet of sen@@ su@@ ality by the hand of Pen@@ el@@ ope Cruz , Nic@@ ole K@@ id@@ man and F@@ ergie .
The stars were more da@@ zz@@ ling than ever , wra@@ pped in designer dres@@ ses , as elegant as they were sexy , at the premi@@ ere of &apos; N@@ ine &apos; . ( Photos : G@@ tre@@ son@@ line )
Our own &apos; P@@ e &apos; , as sophisticated as ever , decided on a dark &apos; lady . &apos; 
The promise of Fon@@ Pe@@ ek
Pe@@ ek is extremely limited , a device that &apos;s only used for checking email , without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attach@@ ments or surfing the web .
It enjoyed its 5 minutes of f@@ ame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year .
Se@@ eing it on the street is more difficult , to be honest , but the idea can be interesting , especially for children .
Unlike sm@@ art@@ phones , the Pe@@ ek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee , less than half , for example , of the iPhone &apos;s data plan .
Given its success , the company has released two new devices : one exclusively for Twitter , the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Pe@@ ek .
Fon@@ Pe@@ ek , presented at the La Web event yesterday , is the European version of the in@@ vention and its third inc@@ ar@@ nation .
It is just as limited as its U.S. counter@@ part , but comes with a surprise .
The monthly service price , around 12 euros a month , includes ro@@ aming throughout Europe .
Those who travel with a sm@@ art@@ phone already know what it &apos;s like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desper@@ ately search for a caf@@ e with WiFi ( or a F@@ on connection ) to check their mail .
The idea of fix@@ ed-@@ price ro@@ aming is incredibly attractive and long awa@@ ited .
Yes , some operators have special arrangements and travel plans , but in my experience it takes a doc@@ torate in physi@@ cs to understand them and good gl@@ asses to read the fine print .
The repeated twi@@ sting of the European Commission &apos;s arm to get affordable ro@@ aming rates across Europe has had almost no notic@@ eable effect .
There &apos;s a fear of using data outside one &apos;s home country , and rightly so .
For a g@@ ad@@ get like the Fon@@ Pe@@ ek ( it no longer seems strange that it is called F@@ on since it lacks WiFi ) to get this kind of fee , it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of rec@@ ou@@ ping the cost of their data networks .
The Kin@@ dle is another good example , including a book downloading feature and other internet queries .
No contracts , no bo@@ ther .
It &apos;s a connected device and is paid for when it &apos;s purchased , not month by month .
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fon@@ Pe@@ ek , a call option with life-@@ time access , which the Pe@@ ek already has in the U.@@ S .
Not because I &apos;m going to buy it .
I check my mail on my phone , thank you .
I hope so because I think it &apos;s an unfair model for the consumer .
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system .
Mich@@ elle &apos;s color fe@@ tish
Y@@ ellow is , without a doubt , the U.S. First Lady &apos;s favorite color .
She already attended Bar@@ ak Obama &apos;s inau@@ gu@@ ration as U.S. president in a yellow dress and coat ; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life : the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo .
Mich@@ elle Obama wor@@ e a very similar dress on both occasions : apart from being a similar y@@ el@@ low-@@ green color with bright highligh@@ ts@@ - , both times the out@@ fit consi@@ sted of three pieces , a dress , jack@@ et and coat of the same material , and was ad@@ or@@ ned with a large em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y or nec@@ kl@@ ace .
So much so that , at first gl@@ ance , it seemed the first lady of the U.S. has been following the Princ@@ ess of Ast@@ uri@@ as &apos; lead and has op@@ ted to repeat her war@@ dro@@ be .
But the material the two suits are made of make them very different .
If the inau@@ gu@@ ration was about thick l@@ ace , in Oslo it was pat@@ tern@@ ed vel@@ v@@ et .
The accessories have also varied : green medium-@@ he@@ eled shoes the other time , and now a similar design , but in gold .
And equally different is the hair style : on this occasion , hair tied back ; previously she wor@@ e her hair down .
75 % of working mothers have had work problems during mat@@ ernity .
Dis@@ crimin@@ ation at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers .
This has been revealed by a study entitled &apos; Fer@@ tili@@ ty and work history of women in Spain &apos; , developed by the CS@@ IC in collaboration with the Women &apos;s Institute .
The survey of 9,@@ 7@@ 37 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it : 75 % of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to mat@@ ernity .
The study notes that there are many differences in when couples start co@@ hab@@ iting , in the number of children , depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do .
Those that don &apos;t have an activity outside of the home , work part time , or don &apos;t have a stable job start living with their partner sooner , expect their first child , and have more children .
By contrast , women with a stable job , especially in the public sector , put off co@@ hab@@ itation and mo@@ ther@@ hood and have fewer off@@ spring .
&quot; Women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child , on average , 3.@@ 7 years after starting to live together , a figure which increases to 4.@@ 1 ; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals , which has led them to postp@@ one getting married and having children .
Additionally , the type of job held has a great influence over mat@@ ernity , but less over the m@@ ating schedule , &quot; explains CS@@ IC resear@@ cher , Mar@@ gar@@ ita Del@@ g@@ ado .
Level of education is another factor wh@@ ich@@ differenti@@ ates the age of women mar@@ rying and having their first child .
According to the survey , the higher the level of education , the older the age at which they get married and have their first child .
There was also a difference among women from the same generation .
For example , in a group of 35@@ - to 4@@ 9-@@ year-@@ olds , those who had elem@@ entary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time , on average , at 2@@ 5.@@ 1 and 3@@ 2.1 respectively .
Their level of education provides yet another division among women .
While those who have an elem@@ entary education mar@@ ry and have their first child before finding a stable job , those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a pre@@ condition to marriage and having a child , &quot; Del@@ g@@ ado speci@@ fies .
Di@@ ane Kru@@ ger is also worth it
L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al Paris has just added a new name to its en@@ viable list of amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors : Di@@ ane Kru@@ ger .
Starting next year , the German ac@@ tress will become the image of the brand &apos;s different products , singing the universal s@@ logan &apos; Because I &apos;m worth it . &apos;

Poker by Manuel Vic@@ ent
In &apos; Four A@@ ces &apos; ( Al@@ f@@ agu@@ ara , illu@@ strations by Fern@@ ando Vic@@ ente ) Manuel Vic@@ ent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary life ( and , in some cases , the other one too ) .
He does not do it in predictable or terrible ways ( bi@@ ographi@@ cal sk@@ etch , life and work ) , rather by looking for something that spark@@ ed the creation of the character .
The trip has its exc@@ it@@ ements , and Vinc@@ ent us spa@@ res no sc@@ ares or ill@@ um@@ inations .
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure , the book is a tou@@ ching invitation to be read and r@@ ere@@ ad .
Here are some sni@@ pp@@ ets .
On Albert Cam@@ us : &quot; In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn &apos;t a sea , rather a spiritual inst@@ inc@@ t , almost physical , the same one I felt without giving it a name : the pleasure against the ill-@@ f@@ ated , mor@@ ality without gu@@ ilt , and inno@@ c@@ ence without any go@@ d . &quot;
On Samu@@ el B@@ eck@@ ett : &quot; Ni@@ hi@@ li@@ stic , alleg@@ or@@ ical Christian , he wrote what was in his blood , not in his intel@@ le@@ ct , between im@@ poten@@ ce and ignor@@ ance , with a da@@ zz@@ ling po@@ e@@ tic hum@@ or , meaning@@ less , like the bla@@ de of the kni@@ fe that was about to kill him . &quot;
On Gra@@ ham Gre@@ ene : &quot; Our man was ab@@ duc@@ ted by this woman with a passion that la@@ sted for thir@@ teen years , in which fl@@ es@@ h combined the exc@@ itement of adul@@ tery with the pleasure of re@@ mor@@ se , a spiritual privilege which consi@@ sted of reaching he@@ aven through the road of per@@ dition . &quot;
On James Jo@@ y@@ ce : &quot; &apos; U@@ ly@@ sses &apos; was published in Paris in 19@@ 22 by Sy@@ l@@ via Be@@ ach@@ .@@ This is one of the eigh@@ t-@@ thous@@ and-@@ meter peaks of world literature which must be sc@@ aled by the north face , which the best mountain clim@@ bers hur@@ l themselves off time and time again . &quot;
On William F@@ aul@@ k@@ ner : &quot; He was a wei@@ rd guy . &quot;
Of himself , he sometimes said that he was the h@@ eir to a land@@ owner in the county , and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a cro@@ codi@@ le .
&quot; They were both dreams of gran@@ de@@ ur . &quot;
On Lou@@ is-@@ Fer@@ din@@ and Cel@@ ine : &quot; This writer took the der@@ an@@ ged scre@@ am cri@@ ed from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his ec@@ o , under his literary form , into the dep@@ ths of the night of the 20th century , and made it a journey , hi@@ ding from himself and calling on the past with a violent dis@@ course to the wor@@ ms . &quot;
On Dor@@ o@@ thy Par@@ ker : &quot; One day , she kne@@ eled and pra@@ yed : &apos; De@@ ar God , I be@@ g you to make me stop writing like a woman &apos; . &quot;
On Joseph Con@@ rad : &quot; On his tom@@ b were en@@ gra@@ ved these ver@@ ses from Spen@@ cer : &apos; Sle@@ ep after to@@ il , / port after stor@@ my seas , / ease after war , / death after life does greatly please . &apos; &quot;
On Vir@@ g@@ inia Wolf : &quot; She also carried her de@@ pres@@ sions in her luggage .
The husband accepted it as normal when she told him that Ed@@ ward VII spi@@ ed on her from the az@@ ale@@ as and that the birds s@@ ang in Greek .
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neuro@@ tic woman whose literary talent came before her ma@@ dness . &quot;
On Pi@@ o Baro@@ ja : &quot; What did Mar@@ tin@@ -S@@ an@@ tos do but try to ino@@ cul@@ ate Jo@@ y@@ ce in Baro@@ ja ?
What did Ben@@ et try but to pass Baro@@ ja through the weapons of F@@ aul@@ k@@ ner ?
What did C@@ ela do but ab@@ duc@@ t the gl@@ ory of that man so that it would serve his own pe@@ dest@@ al ?
Co@@ war@@ dly Ag@@ gression
Last week , my 7@@ 0-@@ year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fu@@ en@@ lab@@ ra@@ da when a group of kids between 15 and 18 years old passed alongside her and our dog , a mix@@ ed-@@ bre@@ ed , rescu@@ ed from the po@@ und and weigh@@ ing no more than six ki@@ los , and , without saying a word , ki@@ cked the dog twice , leaving the dog badly injured .
Our indi@@ gn@@ ation knew no bo@@ unds because we don &apos;t see the fun in grat@@ uit@@ ous ag@@ gression towards a small and defen@@ sel@@ ess animal , which by the way , was on a le@@ ash .
It must be added that it dist@@ res@@ sed the woman who was cal@@ mly taking a walk and who , when she re@@ prim@@ anded those individuals , came to fear for her safety , because a lun@@ atic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman , a child , an elderly person , and , certainly , to anyone weaker than himself .
The incident took place on a@@ Tuesday at five o &apos;@@ clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet neighborhood .
The dog was cr@@ ying all day .
By the way , we filed a complaint at a nearby police station which we doubt means much , not@@ to sti@@ r up trouble , just to clarify that the co@@ war@@ dly mur@@ der@@ ers were Spanish .
The ou@@ trage has led us to den@@ ounce this fact .
We don &apos;t understand what is happening when young people consider it fun to grat@@ uit@@ ously mist@@ re@@ at a defen@@ sel@@ ess animal which gives us love , compan@@ ionship and friendship .
We don &apos;t know if there is any poli@@ teness and respect for animals and people left .
Mich@@ e@@ lin and F@@ es@@ vi@@ al united on the use of hel@@ m@@ ets
The ti@@ re manufacturer Mich@@ e@@ lin , in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety ( F@@ es@@ vi@@ al ) , has launched a campaign to promote the use of hel@@ m@@ ets , especially among younger motor@@ ists , both organizations reported today .
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a hel@@ met , because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing head inj@@ uries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motor@@ cycle .
Mich@@ e@@ lin indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety which &quot; goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day , &quot; and added that it also contributes towards this goal by means of other educational and informative measures .
This new campaign promoting hel@@ met use in motor@@ cycles , under the motto &apos; To be or not to be , &apos; will initially distribute post@@ ers to more than 500 motor@@ cycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible .
Finally , Mich@@ e@@ lin stressed that road safety &quot; is a constant concern &quot; for the company , as being a manufacturer of ti@@ res for two-@@ whe@@ eled vehicles , one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products .
Sales of light commercial vehicles on the increase
Almost two years later , the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel .
The 9,@@ 4@@ 25 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.@@ 6 % from 2008 , and , more importantly , indicates the first increase after 22 consec@@ utive months of decline , according to figures from the manufacturers association ( AN@@ FA@@ C ) and the vend@@ ors association ( G@@ AN@@ V@@ AM ) .
However , it &apos;s not time to start celeb@@ rating since the reference the comparison was made to -@@ November 200@@ 8@@ - was particularly bad , with a 60 % decrease from the previous year .
The outcome is that , regardless of last month &apos;s up@@ turn , the total number of regi@@ strations during those 11 months is 40 % below last year &apos;s .
Since January , 9@@ 5,@@ 8@@ 53 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hot@@ ch@@ po@@ tch of light commercial vehicles were sold : derived v@@ ans , pick ups , v@@ ans , light v@@ ans and ligh@@ t-@@ chas@@ sis trucks .
At the same time , the storm clou@@ ds affecting demand have not completely cle@@ ared , so even though they are also purchased by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises , almost all of which pay through external funding .
As a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans , it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline .
In light of this , unlike cars , the aid of the 200@@ 0@@ E@@ purchase has done little .
A@@ side from individuals , provisions are made for the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not excee@@ ding 160 gram@@ s per kilom@@ eter , but the number of transactions has been in@@ significant .
Just yesterday , the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles , and also to commercial ver@@ hi@@ cles ( trucks and buses ) , was brought to mind by G@@ AN@@ V@@ AM .
The s@@ ellers &apos; association predic@@ ts that 2010 will be similar to the year coming to a close , which estimates a 19 % drop in sales ( passenger cars and 4@@ x@@ 4@@ s ) .
Support for emergency bra@@ king is already obligatory
Support systems to emergency bra@@ kes will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars , just as it happened with anti-@@ lock breaks ( AB@@ S ) and will happen with stability control ( ES@@ P )
In fact , they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011 .
The measure , imposed by the European Union , aims to increase pedestrian safety ; however , how they work can also help prevent many re@@ ar-@@ end col@@ li@@ sions .
What the emergency bra@@ ke assi@@ stant does is increase the pressure on the bra@@ kes in the event of an emergency , which the system dete@@ cts through the driver &apos;s pressure on the pe@@ dal .
But this doesn &apos;t always maintain that pressure through to the end .
According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer , Bo@@ sch , a third of drivers involved in an accident had not step@@ ped on the bra@@ ke before a col@@ li@@ sion and half of them didn &apos;t apply the full force .
Up to 1,@@ 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid , however , calls for the full bra@@ king system , reducing the distance the car needs to stop .
According to an EU study , if all cars were equipped with this feature , 1,@@ 100 fat@@ al accidents involving pedestri@@ ans could be avoided a year .
The reduction will be even bigger -@@ it estimates that one in four accidents inj@@ uring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency bra@@ king systems become popular .
In this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system which ( via ra@@ dar or a camera ) dete@@ cts obstacles and war@@ ns the driver , in addition to ligh@@ tly applying the bra@@ kes .
If the driver re@@ acts , he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pe@@ dal if it is necessary .
If he does not react , and even though the col@@ li@@ sion is un@@ avoid@@ able , the device exer@@ ts the maximum force to the bra@@ kes to minim@@ ize damage .
General Motors delays Op@@ el plan until January
While workers at the Op@@ el plant in F@@ igu@@ er@@ u@@ el@@ as ( Zar@@ ago@@ za ) have already been informed by N@@ ick Rei@@ l@@ ly , the new president of General Motors ( GM ) Europe , that the production of the new M@@ eri@@ va will begin in the first week of April -@@ probably the 8@@ th@@ - as reported by J@@ avier Or@@ te@@ ga , the U.S. manufacturer is cau@@ tioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for Op@@ el .
N@@ ick Rei@@ l@@ ly , the new president of GM Europe , wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the affected party .
And this may make the final document , which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be delayed until the beginning of 2010 .
On the other hand , GM is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of Sa@@ ab should be made in the next few days .
It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible .
GM ad@@ mits to having had contact with some potential new buyers .
One of them could be Ge@@ ely , which aims to acquire Vol@@ vo , but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Sk@@ yp@@ er , which is funded by the Russian group Conver@@ g , is gaining momentum .
In the event that none of them come to an agreement , GM would be able to sell some Sa@@ ab assets to the Chinese Ba@@ ic .
The decision to close Sa@@ ab at the end of the year if it is not sold still stands .
Dri@@ ving the Porsche Bo@@ x@@ ster Spy@@ der
To develop their latest and most precious gem , the Porsche engineers took the Bo@@ x@@ ster S as a base and succeeded in tri@@ mming it by no less than 80 ki@@ los , making the total weight a mere 1,@@ 2@@ 75 ki@@ los .
This led them to , first , cutting out the automatic roof , which has been sub@@ stituted by a manu@@ ally-@@ operated can@@ vas one , saving 21 ki@@ los ; using al@@ umin@@ um doors , like those on the GT@@ 3 , &apos; drop@@ ping &apos; another 15 , removing the climate control , 13 ; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 li@@ ters , earning 7 more ki@@ los ; mounting spor@@ ty bu@@ cket seats , another 12 , and with the 19@@ -@@ inch light@@ weight wheels , five .
Finally , fore@@ going the CD@@ R-@@ 30 sound system brought it down another 6 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s , and changing the door hand@@ les to fabric ones cut the remaining kil@@ o .
Even though it is also available with the PD@@ K du@@ al-@@ cl@@ ut@@ ch shift , the test was conducted on a unit with the six-@@ speed manual transmission , mainly on the back roads of California and along stret@@ ches of really win@@ dy mountain roads .
Its performance can only be described as fla@@ w@@ less .
The reduction in weight does not imp@@ ly that the car doesn &apos;t gri@@ p the asp@@ halt .
Rather the complete opposite : it has been some time since we tested a model so small and light , which , in turn , transmitted so much confidence when corn@@ ering , even at high speeds .
It is a small athle@@ te , able to warm up its mus@@ cles in a low gear for as long as we need , until ordered to sprin@@ t , to bra@@ ke , to recover and go back to explo@@ iting its engine ...
Just what we asked for . Thanks to its ste@@ ering , as communic@@ ative as it is precise , what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do .
And it will do it with sur@@ gical precision .
Op@@ tional engine noise
The sound of its V@@ 6 bo@@ xer with 3@@ 20 horse power ( 10 more than the Bo@@ x@@ ster S ) is well made and can be enhan@@ c@@ ed@@ with the &apos; sport &apos; option and through a system that modi@@ fies the ro@@ ar of the engine , which deb@@ uted earlier in the Pan@@ am@@ era .
The acceler@@ ation is brutal , either from a stand@@ still or recover@@ ing .
The suspension is firm but not harsh or un@@ comfortable .
The asp@@ halt of the high@@ ways we cro@@ ssed with the Bo@@ x@@ ster Spy@@ der was fairly be@@ aten up , but the car handled the po@@ th@@ ol@@ es well .
The electronic ai@@ ds hardly showed up on the course ; that is because , well into the morning , we found early morning ice and gra@@ vel on some cur@@ ves .
In short , it is an ul@@ tra light@@ weight car , one of the most fun to drive on the market , an@@ dis a bit more than just a simple modification of the Bo@@ x@@ ster S .
The car will go on sale in February 2010 , priced at 7@@ 0,@@ 9@@ 31 euros .

Bas@@ kon@@ ia gives away a victory in Israel
Ca@@ ja Lab@@ oral achieved a stunning 8@@ 2-@@ 91 victory on their visit to the M@@ acc@@ abe@@ e Elec@@ tra court despite D@@ us@@ ko I@@ van@@ o@@ vic &apos;s team &apos;s heavy losses , and after the great performance by M@@ iz@@ ra Tel@@ to@@ vic , who was the best on his team with eight three-@@ po@@ inters sco@@ red ( 29 points ) , they now at the top of their group .
The Vit@@ orian team knew to make up for the significant ab@@ sen@@ ces of Herr@@ mann , O@@ les@@ on , Hu@@ er@@ tas and Mi@@ co@@ v with a big dose of involvement and team work , even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory .
Additionally , their huge success from the sid@@ el@@ ines , with 16 three po@@ inters sco@@ red , had a lot to do with the final tri@@ umph .
The game started out in favor of the A@@ zu@@ l@@ gran@@ as , who put themselves ahead on the sco@@ re@@ board from the start .
As Vit@@ ora &apos;s first four bas@@ k@@ ets were from the per@@ im@@ eter , the speculation was already that they had j@@ ump@@ ed into the Israeli net with hot wri@@ sts .
English and Tel@@ et@@ o@@ vic were the main sc@@ or@@ ers of the 18-@@ 20 at the end of the first period .
The second quarter was more of the same , but the Ala@@ van team op@@ ted for the inside game of Bar@@ ac and the work of Eli@@ y@@ ah@@ u , who was gre@@ eted with whi@@ st@@ les and ap@@ plause at his return home , to continue increasing their lead by half-@@ time ( 3@@ 4-@@ 43 ) .
Tel@@ et@@ o@@ vic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points , even though Sp@@ li@@ tter &apos;s &quot; six fewer &quot; points already sign@@ aled that it wasn &apos;t going to be the best night for the Brazilian .
But the game , despite being headed for half time , was not more deci@@ de@@ d@@ and the M@@ acc@@ abe@@ es tried to remind the Vit@@ ori@@ ans that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the &apos; hand of Eli@@ as &apos; putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .
Ei@@ d@@ son and P@@ n@@ ini played a decisive role in the &quot; y@@ el@@ lows &apos; &quot; return to the light .
More dis@@ advantages
I@@ van@@ o@@ vic &apos;s players , injured but far from dead , needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could brea@@ the , and that &apos;s when the machine gun Mar@@ za Tel@@ et@@ o@@ vic arrived , with three almost consec@@ utive three-@@ po@@ inters and the help of English and Ri@@ bas , he brought the sco@@ re@@ board back to a re@@ ass@@ uring lead ( 5@@ 4-@@ 67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 5@@ 7-@@ 67 ) .
The A@@ lav@@ as worked themselves to the bone in the last period , and English and San E@@ me@@ teri@@ o ( 6@@ 5-@@ 75 ) had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes .
However , P@@ n@@ ini and Ei@@ d@@ son , the best on their team , did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-@@ point line ( 7@@ 0-@@ 77 ) .
In spite of this , and with Sp@@ li@@ tter f@@ ou@@ ling out , I@@ v@@ onic &apos;s team didn &apos;t rus@@ h , defended well , and , even though the Israelis came close at the last minute , the game ws already won and victory escap@@ ed Tel Avi@@ v for the first time in the season .
In@@ j@@ uries impe@@ de Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja &apos;s fight
Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja lost mis@@ er@@ ably in Greece against the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os and gave them the lead in Group B of the Euro@@ le@@ ague in a game marked by the loss of the ca@@ j@@ ist@@ as , especially in the inside game ( Fre@@ eland , Lim@@ a and Archi@@ bald ) which facilit@@ ated the Greek victory .
The Malaga team was not co@@ wed by the atmosphere in the Peace and Fri@@ end@@ ship Stadium , nor by the excellence of its ri@@ val , maybe the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget .
The playing exhi@@ bited in the first quarter allowed the Andalu@@ si@@ ans to take it eas@@ y.@@ An aggressive defense and three consec@@ utive three-@@ po@@ inters , two from the point guard O@@ mar C@@ ook , and one from Guil@@ lem G@@ ub@@ io , ba@@ ff@@ led the home team 12-@@ 18 , minute 9 .
The Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os were obviously surprised by Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja &apos;s intensity , even though the home team &apos;s ar@@ senal in the inside game with Bou@@ rou@@ sis , V@@ u@@ j@@ ci@@ c and Sch@@ or@@ ts@@ an@@ iti@@ s brought them back to 2@@ 2-@@ 20 , in the 13th minute , at which point an attempted fight between the two U.S. point guards , Be@@ ver@@ ley and Willi@@ ams , resulted in the dis@@ qualification of both players .
The Greek team started showing their su@@ peri@@ ority inside both zones , where the loss of English center Jo@@ el Fre@@ eland to injury and three personal f@@ ou@@ ls by Carlos Jim@@ en@@ ez ham@@ pered the ca@@ j@@ ist@@ as .
Between them the inside players and the Lithu@@ anian forward , Lin@@ as Lei@@ z@@ as , with their three-@@ po@@ inters , increased the lead to 4@@ 4-@@ 32 in the 19th minute .
An impossible com@@ eb@@ ack
The third period was very offensive for the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os , who , despite 19 losses , proved superior and began to even out the difference in the game in Malaga , making it 6@@ 6-@@ 48 in the 27@@ th minute , which sh@@ ook the group leader .
Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja tried to overcome their ab@@ sen@@ ces and the latest withdrawal of the Scottish center , Robert Archi@@ bald , who was injured during the game .
Despite all the problems , because of C@@ ook &apos;s control and three-@@ po@@ inters , and Le@@ wis &apos; assi@@ sts , Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja had some hope left with the score at 6@@ 6-@@ 57 in the 3@@ 1st minute .
But it was practically impossible because the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os , when pressed and given their su@@ peri@@ ority , seemed un@@ stopp@@ able once cen@@ tim@@ eters inside the zone .
The Croatian center , Nikol@@ a V@@ u@@ j@@ ci@@ c , managed to bring back the bas@@ ket average to 8@@ 1-@@ 62 in the 3@@ 7th minute and Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja gave up , hand@@ ing the top-@@ seed over to the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os .
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile ?
Facebook users can know the sal@@ ary they deserve according to their profile , thanks to a new application Tro@@ v@@ it , the search engine with the largest number of real-@@ estate , employment and car classi@@ fi@@ eds in Spain .
The tool &quot; How much should you charge ? &quot; estimates wages of users from more than 14@@ 0@@ ,000 employment offers in Spain on Tro@@ v@@ it , based on a form available on Facebook , where you must enter your profession , years of experience , your age and the city where you want to work .
In the week that the application was launched , the search engine had detected that in general , the Spanish worker &quot; feels under@@ paid , &quot; said the Tro@@ v@@ it Product Manager , Albert Ri@@ ber@@ a .
According to the data Tro@@ v@@ it uses from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France , the Spanish are the lowest paid .
A British program@@ mer charges 4@@ 5,@@ 2@@ 26 euros gross per year , and a French one 3@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 59 , as opposed to the 24@@ ,000 a Span@@ i@@ ard receives .
Similarly , a driver receives an annual net pay of 3@@ 4,@@ 24@@ 7 euros in England , 25@@ ,@@ 7@@ 51 in France , and 16@@ ,@@ 4@@ 20 in Spain .
According to Tro@@ v@@ it , the lowest paid job in Spain is wa@@ iter , with annual net earnings of 1@@ 1,@@ 5@@ 92 euros ; followed by sal@@ es@@ person , with 14@@ ,@@ 7@@ 25 euros , and operator , with 15@@ ,@@ 6@@ 67 euros .
The most sear@@ ch@@ ed-@@ for jobs on the net in the past three months are drivers , part-@@ time jobs and social worker .
Brazil sets a release date for Z@@ el@@ aya
The Brazilian Government has put a deadline on Manuel Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s stay in the emb@@ assy in Te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa .
The de@@ posed president must leave the emb@@ assy by the 27@@ th of January , 2010 at the latest , when his mandate officially ends .
Francisco Cat@@ und@@ a , the char@@ g@@ é d ’ aff@@ aires of the Brazilian Emb@@ assy in the Hon@@ du@@ ran capital , told TV Glob@@ o that &quot; M@@ el &quot; knows that he must leave the emb@@ assy , where he has been a refugee since 21st September , before that date .
&quot; He is aware that he has to leave on January 27@@ th , the end of his term ; he has to look for another occupation . &quot;
The station also quoted the former president , who confirmed his intention to leave the emb@@ assy before the deadline : &quot; My plan is to leave as soon as possible , obviously with the support of the Brazilian government , &quot; Z@@ el@@ aya said via telephone .
Following the November 29@@ th elections ( in which Pro@@ fir@@ o Lob@@ o was elected ) , Z@@ el@@ aya said that he would remain in the emb@@ assy until January .
However , this very week , he tried to find refuge in Brazil .
The operation finally ended un@@ successfully with the rejection of Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s political refugee status , which the Government headed by Rober@@ to Mich@@ el@@ etti tried to impose &quot; de facto &quot; .
Thanks a lot
After days of wine and ro@@ ses from last spring , when inflation was the prev@@ ailing trend on the markets , uncertainty again re@@ ars its ug@@ ly head , which is not surprising since it is their natural state , in an environment in which agents make decisions about the naturally uncertain future .
The cure prescri@@ bed by the central banks to stabili@@ ze the markets was to mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly give an open bar liquidity at clo@@ se-@@ to-@@ zero rates so that the financial institutions would buy de@@ duc@@ tible assets .
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and , without ques@@ tioning their un@@ orthodo@@ x liquidity policy , are beginning to throw a spann@@ er in the works as the ECB makes its y@@ early auction next week .
Therefore , investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such un@@ orthodo@@ x measures , and we are seeing a re@@ versal of the reduction in risk premi@@ ums .
The vol@@ atility of the stock markets and the corporate bond sp@@ reads have swiftly picked up again , even though they are far behind the extreme levels that they reached at the beginning of the year .
The states were oblig@@ ated to soci@@ alize private risk , and again public debt is going to be affected .
Again there is a flight for quality and the U.S. , Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors , causing a@@ wider spread of the Eurozone countries in respect to Germany .
Spain hardly seems to have been affected by this period of instability , but that &apos;s when Standard and Po@@ or &apos;s arrived and threatened a new revision , down@@ gra@@ ding the Kingdom of Spain .
Furthermore , some uncertainty doesn &apos;t hur@@ t to silence defen@@ ders of moral haz@@ ard , who again tried to raise awareness of those responsible for the global economic policy by having stopped the destructive effects derived from credit restrictions on the loss of jobs , when what should be done is to declare a new Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving Day .
However , Dubai &apos;s pain@@ ts with a tri@@ bal fight between the em@@ irs to restore power in the em@@ ir@@ ates , and we &apos;ve already seen it before in Greece .
A Government which hi@@ des the public deficit , elections and a new Government that pul@@ ls up the rug .
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi , and So@@ crates in Portugal after Barroso .
It doesn &apos;t make sense that Eco@@ fin saved Hung@@ ry from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year , and th@@ ati@@ t is going to let a euro member@@ -@@ country fail to fulfill its commitments .
What is logical is that Eco@@ fin has forced the Greek government to be transparent , and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
If , as we hope , we find ourselves before a standardi@@ zed period of transi@@ ent risk premi@@ ums , after some excess of le@@ ver@@ aged positions , it would be within our expectations .
In the case of Spain , since our public debt is spreading like the European corporate bonds , we should not be worried .
If the European sp@@ reads decrease and ours continue to expand , then it would be an i@@ dio@@ syn@@ cratic risk for Spain .
That of Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s is an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te . When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to anticip@@ ate its recovery scenarios and to rev@@ ise up its scenario for 2011 , including the OECD and the European Commission , they return to the fra@@ y with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy , and long life expec@@ tan@@ cy does not por@@ tend its warning .
Again , it has all the ear@@ marks to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets , but for now , &quot; pru@@ dence , my driver . &quot;
Rel@@ ated sectors
The Iber@@ dro@@ la Chairman , Ign@@ acio San@@ che@@ z Gal@@ an , was the first to speak yesterday before the sub@@ committee of the House of Represent@@ atives , where Spain &apos;s energy strategy for the next two decades is currently being debated .
After his speech , which was followed by the president of Gas Natur@@ al-@@ Fen@@ o@@ sa , Raf@@ ael Vil@@ las@@ ec@@ a , Gal@@ an gave the press a few gli@@ mp@@ ses of what was planned in the sub@@ committee behind closed doors .
For the president of Iber@@ dro@@ la , Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 20@@ 30 , while they keep operating the nuclear power plants which are pres@@ ently open .
Otherwise , the investments required will not be 60 billion , but up to 95 billion .
Yes , Iber@@ dro@@ la believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on increasing its generating capacity , but on distribution networks and on international inter@@ connections .
From 2020 on , the matter changes and the power will have to increase .
His bet is in both coal plants with@@ carbon dioxide cat@@ chers and , especially , renewable sources of energy .
In this case , he considers that it takes 18@@ ,000 new M@@ W , and that is with &quot; support energy . &quot;
Though he believes that the Sustain@@ able Economy Act , which the government has just approved , is in line with what his company has been calling for , Gal@@ an would not draw blood with a royal decre@@ e to promote the consumption of domestic coal , which contradi@@ cts the policies to combat climate change .
In his opinion , there is &quot; a clear , long-term gam@@ ble &quot; in this sense , despite the &quot; sure &quot; measures , as the Chairman of Iber@@ dro@@ la calls them .
As it is , Gal@@ an believes that the decisions to invest , even though they are long-term , should start to be made since it has already taken a long time to think them through , and a stable framework for addressing remuner@@ ation is necessary .
Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al wins the &apos; handling &apos; of A@@ er L@@ ing@@ us in ten airports
Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al &apos;s airport ground services subsidiary , Swiss Swis@@ sport , is going to be the Irish airline A@@ er L@@ ing@@ us &apos; preferred partner for cargo services in ten of the European airports where it operates .
Paris , London , Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most prominent .
The agreement , which has not tran@@ sc@@ ended economic terms , will last for five years .
Moreover , Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al , the autonomous government of Cas@@ ti@@ le-@@ La Man@@ cha , and the University of Al@@ cal@@ a de Hen@@ ares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create a Center for the Innovation of Intel@@ ligent Infra@@ structure .
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million by 2012 , 50 % of which comes from Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al .
One of the center &apos;@@ st@@ asks will be to research energy efficiency on high@@ ways and in airports .
Ac@@ ci@@ ona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hot@@ chief and Bou@@ y@@ gues .
Ac@@ ci@@ ona is stru@@ ggling for its first highway conc@@ ession in Australia , a market where it already operates as a an energy and water company .
The construction involves a 1.@@ 7 billion Australian dollar tunnel ( about 1.@@ 0@@ 47 billion euros ) .
The French Bou@@ y@@ gues and German Hot@@ chief are its ri@@ vals .
A 5-@@ km tunnel in the Australian city of B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e , on the east coast , has become the closest chance for Ac@@ cion@@ ato settle in the country@@ as a construction and motorway company .
The city council wants to have it completed by the end of 2014 .
After op@@ ting for the public-@@ private partnership ( the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m PP@@ P in English ) to move the project forward , in a business plan under the tut@@ el@@ age of Ernst &amp; Young , the administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll .
Depending on the bi@@ ds submitted by next May , the planned investment comes to 1.@@ 7 billion Australian dollars ( 1.@@ 0@@ 47 billion euros ) and three con@@ sor@@ tia , with a remarkable predomin@@ ance of European construction firms , are competing in the final stage .
The group known as Tran@@ sc@@ ity , is headed by Ac@@ ci@@ ona , the only Spanish one in the competition , and its partners are BM@@ D and Gh@@ ella .
The first is a major Australian construction company , while the second , based in Italy , is one of Europe &apos;s leading specialists in under@@ ground@@ construc@@ tions .
The Northern District con@@ sortium is pit@@ ted against Ac@@ ci@@ ona &apos;s team , with the presence of Britain &apos;s La@@ ing O &apos;@@ R@@ our@@ ke , the Australian infrastructure group Trans@@ field , and the French construction group Bou@@ y@@ gues .
The third and final con@@ sortium to make it through the selection process is called L@@ BR@@ J@@ V , where Australia &apos;s Lei@@ gh@@ ton ( a subsidiary of the German construction company Ho@@ chti@@ ef , owned in turn by AC@@ S ) , domestic Bau@@ l@@ der@@ stone ( owned by the German group Bil@@ finger Ber@@ ger ) and R@@ az@@ el , the Gal@@ lic firm speciali@@ zing in civil construction , split the capital .
The Australian infrastructures market promises big jobs and privati@@ zation , but it carries a clear star@@ t-@@ up difficulty if it &apos;s not le@@ an@@ ing towards hi@@ ring a local construction company .
It is one strategy that the afore@@ mentioned Ho@@ chti@@ ef and Bil@@ finger , in addition to Asian shareholders , have pursued , and one that remains un@@ resolved for the Spanish gi@@ ants in the industry .
AC@@ S barely acquired a position in that market through its 30 % stake in Ho@@ chti@@ ef , the@@ propri@@ et@@ or of the afore@@ mentioned Lei@@ gh@@ ton .
Asset milli@@ on@@ aires
Ac@@ ci@@ ona is bi@@ d@@ ding on a geographical location of the utmost importance for the sector , which already has a strong presence from its activity as an energy provider and the des@@ al@@ ination business .
Among other assets , it has the largest wind farm , W@@ au@@ bra Wind Farm ( 19@@ 2 M@@ W ) in Victoria , and leads the corporate gro@@ u@@ pre@@ spon@@ sible for building and managing the des@@ al@@ ination plant in Adel@@ ai@@ da with a budget of 700 million .
Now it intends to consolidate these two areas and exploit syn@@ ergies in the fields of construction and infrastructure operations .
The underground toll road , spon@@ sored by the B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Department of Infra@@ structure and the Northern Link , is c@@ alle@@ du@@ p@@ on to connect the T@@ oo@@ w@@ ong Western High@@ way with the b@@ yp@@ ass in Kel@@ vin Gro@@ ve ( see map ) through the 5-@@ kilom@@ eter tun@@ n@@ el@@ .@@ It is a major ende@@ a@@ vor to reduce the traffic in B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e .
The timetable set by the administration sets the deadline for the decision in the summer of 2010 and for the work to start in December of next year .
Although this toll road would be open for traffic in the closing months of 2014 , the work is not anticipated to be completed until 20@@ 16 .
The tunnel began to take shape in 2005 .
It will include two lan@@ es in each direction , an electric toll system and a sophisticated ven@@ tilation system .
The Que@@ ens@@ land government will provide 500 million dollars ( 30@@ 8 million euros ) for funding .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e is already offering business to Ho@@ chti@@ ef .
Australia continues to provide remarkable commodities to Ho@@ chti@@ ef , which announced its receipt of a Government contract worth 15@@ 4 million yesterday .
The firm , owned in-@@ part by AC@@ S , will set up the national broadband infrastructure with fi@@ ber op@@ tic c@@ ables through its local subsidiary , Lei@@ gh@@ ton .
This will provide high-speed internet access to 400@@ ,000 people and will provide work for the German firm for 18 months .
Moreover , the company has transferred the project to build the 2@@ 7-@@ story high King George Tower in the Australian city of B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e.@@ The work has yet to begin , and Ho@@ chti@@ ef has closed the sale for 12@@ 9 million .
Pres@@ ently , in the U.@@ K. , more specifically in Manchester , La@@ ing O &apos;@@ R@@ our@@ ke will par@@ take in the construction and operation of two schools over 25 years .
The initial investment will total 75 million euros .
F@@ CC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
F@@ CC , through its subsidiary Alpine , has been awarded the construction of a 2.@@ 1-@@ kilom@@ e@@ ter-@@ long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for 6@@ 4.@@ 5 million euros .
The firm received this contract days after getting Bo@@ s@@ ru@@ ck &apos;s ( Austria ) tunnel expansion job .
By doing this , Alpine is strengthening its expertise in tunnel construction .
The construction is planned to start in the beginning of 2010 , and the project time@@ frame will span 32 months .
S@@ ra . Rus@@ h@@ more is awarded Ren@@ fe &apos;s advertising
Ren@@ fe has appropri@@ ated approximately three million euros annually for the advertising and marketing services of the S@@ ra . Rus@@ h@@ more agency for the next two years , the railway operator reported .
The contract covers the possibility of two 12-@@ month exten@@ sions@@ .@@ S@@ ra@@ . Rus@@ h@@ more has been chosen from the 16 agencies that entered the tender launched by Ren@@ fe , of which there were four fin@@ alists ; among them was T@@ B@@ W@@ A , which was in charge of cre@@ atives for the past 3 years .
From this point forward , S@@ ra . Rus@@ h@@ more will be in charge of campaign design and production .
France Telec@@ om fined 63 million for blocking competitors
The competition regul@@ ator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Telec@@ om for anti-@@ competitive behavior in the country &apos;s Caribbean regions .
According to the institution , the operator limited land@@ line and mobile phone competition by signing exclusive agreements , service plans , and loyalty programs with consumers out@@ side@@ of regulation .
With this san@@ ction , the former French monopoly and state-@@ owned company has accum@@ ulated more than 5@@ 60 million euros in fines since hin@@ dering its competitors in 1994 .
The penalty imposed yesterday has , in fact , increased because the authority that over@@ sees the competition believes France Telec@@ om has committed similar violations in the past and , therefore , is a repeat off@@ ender .
Application shop
On the other hand , the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the foot@@ steps of other operators , and has opened an on-line application shop , with the aim of increasing revenues outside of telecommunications .
At first , the Orange Application Shop will be active in France and the U.@@ K .
It will not reach other countries , including Spain , until 2010 .
Pla@@ ying the Champ@@ ions League has yiel@@ ded 4@@ 7@@ 6.@@ 4 million to Madrid and Barcelona since it was first established
The Champ@@ ions League has become a source of income for clubs since it started in 1992 .
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have collected 4@@ 7@@ 6.@@ 4 million , making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition .
The head of the list is Manchester United .
The head of the list is Manchester United .
W@@ inning the U@@ EFA Champ@@ ions League doesn &apos;t just earn you gl@@ or@@ y.@@ It is also a major source of income for the big clubs .
So much so that U@@ EFA figures show that the competition has dealt out 5,@@ 36@@ 2.5 million euros to the 105 teams ( 12 of them from Spain ) who have participated in the event since the tournament was founded in the 1992 / 1993 season .
Real Madrid and F@@ .@@ C. Barcelona have f@@ ared well in this distribution .
The white club has been the third on the continent to have po@@ ck@@ eted more money from participating , and the only one , after AC Milan , to have won the trop@@ h@@ y three times .
The Catal@@ an team , the defending champion and last winner of the de@@ fun@@ ct European Cup in 1992 , is fifth in the rank@@ ings .
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Much , two teams that have also made more money by participating in the Champ@@ ions League .
And that is in spite of both of them losing against Barcelona .
What more , Spain is only the third country to have made more money through the Champ@@ ions League despite having earned more titles than any other country ( five , compared to Italy &apos;s four , England &apos;s three , and Germany &apos;s two ) .
Distribution
This apparent parado@@ x is explained by the complicated payment system the U@@ EFA uses .
For this fiscal year the body ch@@ ai@@ red by Michel Plat@@ ini expects to collect 1.@@ 0@@ 90 billion for the Champ@@ ions League .
The U@@ EFA dedic@@ ates 4@@ 13.@@ 1 million of that money to pay fixed rates : each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre@@ quali@@ fying round ( including At@@ le@@ tico Madrid ) receives 2.1 million .
Additionally , those who managed to participate received 3.@@ 8 million just for being there , in addition to another 5@@ 50@@ ,000 euros for every game they play .
There are also bon@@ uses for winning ( 800@@ ,000 euros ) and for ties ( 400@@ ,000 for each team ) .The oc@@ ta-@@ fin@@ alists receive three million each ; the eight quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ alists , 3.@@ 3 million .
The last four will po@@ cket 4 million each .
The champion will win 9 million , ver@@ sus the 5.@@ 2 million for the run@@ n@@ er-@@ up .
So , with the idea of the fixed rates , a club takes home at least 7.@@ 1 million , and at most 3@@ 1.2 million .
Barcelona on the other hand po@@ ck@@ eted 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August .
But there are other varying payments to which 33@@ 7.@@ 8 million are allocated .
This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market .
Spain is the leader with four places allocated .
Last year &apos;s champion got 40 % of the allocated money , 30 % for second place , 20 % for third , 10 % for fourth .
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played this year .
Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa offers 61 million euros for 2@@ 9.@@ 9 % of So@@ s
Yesterday , the Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa holding company si@@ fted through the details of the bid on shares which led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25 % and 2@@ 9.@@ 9 % in So@@ s .
It is a percentage which doesn &apos;t require them to launch a ta@@ ke@@ over bid ( O@@ PA ) for all of the securities .
Spec@@ ific@@ ally , Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa is offering 1.@@ 50@@ 25 euro@@ sp@@ er share , to be distributed over 10 years , and with a 1 % annual interest rate .
So@@ s shares closed yesterday at 1.@@ 85 euros ; so , Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa &apos;s offer under@@ valued the company 18 % below the market value .
According to Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa , the price of 1.@@ 50 euros reflects the real value of So@@ s .
The offer is subject to the decision of eight of the 15 advis@@ ers .
The J@@ ere@@ z@@ ano group is giving a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling securities .
The CN@@ M@@ V assured that it had not been informed of the offer , despite Ru@@ iz M@@ ate@@ os &apos; company saying that it had cont@@ acted a regul@@ ator .
If this comes to fru@@ ition , the pay@@ out would reach 6@@ 11.@@ 7 million when the capitali@@ zation of So@@ s is at 25@@ 4.@@ 27 million .
Meanwhile , So@@ s is restructuring its management .
In an attempt to stay out of possible ta@@ ke@@ over bi@@ ds and the legal v@@ ag@@ aries of its former managers , the brothers Jesus and J@@ aim@@ e Sal@@ az@@ ar , it announced the election of Maria Lu@@ is@@ a Jord@@ ana as the director of the internal audit .
It is a decision which makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company .
This is a newly created position which reports directly to the president of the group .
And not without contro@@ vers@@ y , as the company is still immer@@ sed in the legal battle for the alleged di@@ version of over 230 million from So@@ s to the Sal@@ az@@ ar brothers &apos; holding company .
In fact , it &apos;s possible that So@@ s will reveal further di@@ versions of funds in the next few months .
In regards to the Sal@@ az@@ ars &apos; credit , the former advis@@ ers Il@@ def@@ on@@ so Or@@ te@@ ga and An@@ gel Fern@@ an@@ dez Nor@@ ie@@ ga ( representatives of CC@@ M and Un@@ ic@@ a@@ ja ) t@@ esti@@ fied and affir@@ med that they approved of the di@@ version of 2@@ 12 million without knowing where the money was going .
CN@@ M@@ V authorized the exclusion ta@@ ke-@@ over bid submitted by In@@ ver@@ sor@@ a M@@ er
Yesterday , the National Sec@@ urities Market Commission ( CN@@ M@@ V ) approved of the exclusion ta@@ ke-@@ over bid of Feder@@ ico Pat@@ ern@@ ina by In@@ ver@@ sor@@ a M@@ er , which was presented last October 9th .
The supervisory agency explained that this operation is authorized after it is understood that its terms adjust to existing standards and that the information pack@@ et &apos;s contents , submitted after the amendments introduced last December 2nd , are considered sufficient .
The CN@@ M@@ V has stated that the offer addresses the purchase of 5@@ 50@@ ,@@ 00@@ 8 shares of Feder@@ ico Pat@@ ern@@ ina at 7.@@ 65 euros a share , representing 8.@@ 95 % of its share capital , which consists of 6,@@ 14@@ 2,@@ 7@@ 86 shares that are tra@@ ded on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bil@@ ba@@ o .
It also explained that it has frozen 5,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 2,@@ 7@@ 78 million shares , which will not be tra@@ ded in any way until the completion of the offer , which specified the price determined by Fre@@ der@@ ico Pat@@ ern@@ ina in accordance with current regulations .
New tools for inspec@@ ting cars
In these days of stor@@ ms and accidents , it is not only gar@@ ages that are making a profit .
Every day , thousands of cars that have been in accidents are to@@ wed to a garage , where a technici@@ an must evaluate the damage and what the repair will cost .
No claim is the same , and calcul@@ ating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and complicated task .
Man@@ ually calcul@@ ating the cost of a repair between 20@@ ,000 and 30@@ ,000 euros , including parts and labor , may take two or three hours .
However , with the help of the most recent computer tools , it would take a matter of minutes .
This is why almost 100 % of technici@@ ans are using this kind of system .
Provi@@ ders of services , claims solutions , and maintenance are working to comp@@ ile data supplied by manufacturers , and then process it and offer it to customers as a useful tool .
In Spain , Au@@ dat@@ ex , of the North American Gro@@ up@@ o Sol@@ era , is the industry leader ; 80 % of assessments are done using their products .
The other firms in the sector , competing in the field of data assessment and processing , are G@@ t@@ Mo@@ tive and Euro@@ tax .
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple .
According to E@@ du@@ ardo Vel@@ az@@ qu@@ ez , the Au@@ dat@@ ex business manager , 63 manufacturers and impor@@ ters are working in Spain , and each of them sub@@ mits data in a different format .
Furthermore , the amount of data to process is increasing to the point where they have released more versions , vari@@ ants and engines in the last five years than in the previous 15 .
When a new car h@@ its the market , these companies get to work .
It &apos;s very ar@@ du@@ ous work because you have to catalog each of the thousands of vehicle parts and@@ enter in your price .
In addition , a &quot; smart &quot; graphic is made for each model , where you can &quot; click &quot; on different parts of the car .
If it is a mass@@ -@@ market model , the work can be ready in a week , provided the process goes quickly .
If it &apos;s an un@@ common car , it can take up to three or four mon@@ th@@ s.@@ Currently , Au@@ dat@@ ex provides comprehensive data for 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % of the cars sold in Spain .
Among the most exclusive models , information is available for a Porsche , but not a Ferrari or Lam@@ bor@@ gh@@ ini for example .
As for the number of cars in circulation , it is over 99 % .
In order to document and develop the databases , Au@@ dat@@ ex has eight centers scat@@ tered around the world ( Spain , France , Germany , USA , Brazil , Mexico , China and Japan ) , and each of these speciali@@ zes in a specific brand .
Its national headquarters is in Al@@ co@@ ben@@ das ( Madrid ) .
There , over a hundred technici@@ ans ( usually expert mechan@@ ics ) work with three computer screens at the same time .
Au@@ dat@@ ex inv@@ ests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases .
Every month , 2.5 million pieces of information are added , and clients receive updates every two days .
Develop@@ ing that huge flow of information lets them give these companies different applications and varied products .
The most common use focuses on maintenance and repair , but depending on the country , there are also tools to manage scra@@ p pieces and to calcul@@ ate the market and resi@@ dual value of a car .
The only company with a used car guide available in Spain is Euro@@ tax .
Au@@ dat@@ ex doesn &apos;t offer one in our country , but it does in the United States .
In view of the products that Au@@ dat@@ ex offers , it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support available to professionals in this sector .
This company offers 10 different tools ; Au@@ da@@ Plus , being the flag@@ ship product , is the standard solution , designed to allow technici@@ ans to assess claims .
It includes cars , motor@@ cycles , and light and heavy industrial vehicles .
Besides the cost of parts , it includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts .
This tool charges according to the use , for each app@@ ra@@ is@@ al .
The highest cost is 5.@@ 75 euros for customers who rarely use it , 10 times a month at most .
Then , every insurance company that makes thousands of assessments negoti@@ ates their price with Au@@ dat@@ ex .
Other products , like Au@@ da@@ V@@ IN , facilitate the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment that it left the assembly line with , just from its vehicle identification number .
Au@@ da@@ G@@ lass focuses on the glass parts of a car , and Au@@ da@@ Sub@@ ast@@ as is an on-line service open to the professional sector which facilit@@ ates the bi@@ d@@ ding on vehicles cal@@ ssed as wri@@ te-@@ off@@ s .
Their statistics service is very useful for identifying trends , ge@@ o-@@ demographic analysis and knowing standard devi@@ ations of makes and models .
You can study , for example , how many models of a particular make have gone to a shop because of mal@@ functions or how many have been in serious accidents in a certain period .
G@@ t Mo@@ tive is the only Spanish company working to develop these kinds of tools .
It s@@ ells , among others , the G@@ T Es@@ timate , which is again designed for technici@@ ans and also provides digital images , access to parts and the manufacturer &apos;s official prices and times .
G@@ T Mo@@ tive is a G@@ rup@@ o EIN@@ SA company , which was founded in 1971 as a provider of automotive services and solutions for assessing damage , mal@@ functions and maintenance .
The G@@ T App@@ ra@@ is@@ al Guide is its historical reference product on the market .
They work with 24@@ ,000 users in gar@@ ages , 3,@@ 100 technici@@ ans and 53 insurance companies .
Its turnover has grown by 20 % per year over the past three years , and it brought in 10.@@ 8 million euros in 2008 .
Early last year , the globalization process started with the installation of an office in Paris .
Meanwhile , Au@@ dat@@ ex was founded in Germany in 1966 and set up shop in Spain in 1979 .
According to company sources , 62 % of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world , and the remaining 37 % in North and South Americ@@ a.@@ They work with more than 900 insurance companies and 33@@ ,000 shops , 3@@ ,000 of which are in Spain .
G@@ rup@@ o Sol@@ era &apos;s ( Au@@ dat@@ ex , S@@ ide@@ x@@ a , In@@ for@@ me@@ x AB@@ Z , Hol@@ lander and IM@@ S ) worldwide turnover will total 5@@ 57 million dollars , 3.@@ 3 % more than 2008 .
In our country , the company brought in 19.@@ 1 million euros , 7.@@ 2 % more than last year .
In 2005 , G@@ rup@@ o Sol@@ era was valued at 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange , and its shares are now listed for a total of 2.4 billion dollars .
It is been listed on the N@@ Y@@ SE since 2007 and is included in Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s reference index .
Dam@@ aged car on-line au@@ ctions
Last October , G@@ rup@@ o Sol@@ era bought Auto@@ online , an internet platform for selling cars , motor@@ cycles , and especially damaged vehicles .
The ende@@ a@@ vor ent@@ ailed an out@@ lay of 5@@ 9.@@ 5 million euros for 85 % of the company &apos;s capital , which would increase in the upcoming year by the remaining 15 % .
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more valu@@ e-@@ added services to its customers , with the possibility of reaching an immense international market .
This app@@ ra@@ is@@ al and buying and selling service is directed exclusively at professionals in the sector , such as insurance companies , technici@@ ans , r@@ enting agencies , shops , scra@@ p yards , and professional s@@ ellers who must register before using it .
This platform was created in Germany in 1996 , and it manages more than 6@@ 50@@ ,000 transactions throughout Europe , 500@@ ,000 of them in Germany .
Its major markets include Spain , Greece , Poland and Turkey .
The site currently has more than 1,@@ 500 registered s@@ ellers and 4@@ ,000 technici@@ ans .
It over@@ sees 3@@ ,000 listings a day , and around 100 new listings are added every day on the Spanish market .
Under Spanish law , a car whose vehicle identification number has been un@@ registered cannot be put back into circulation but can be used for und@@ am@@ aged spare parts .
Car@@ s with historical value can be registered , even though they have been un@@ registered , after a lengthy registration process .
A shop &apos;s estimate in four steps
With the Au@@ da@@ T@@ aller tool , Au@@ dat@@ ex guarantees that the user gets an estimate in only 4 steps : identify the vehicle , look for the spare part , create an estimate and generate an estimate .
User friend@@ liness is an essential condition for these systems , especially to convincing older technici@@ ans , who , to varying degrees , are usually more reluc@@ tant to use new management techniques .
The database includes 1,@@ 0@@ 34 vehicles , 6@@ 66 of which are cars , 10@@ 9 spor@@ t-@@ utility vehicles , 137 motor@@ cycles , 78 v@@ ans and 44 trucks .
Naturally , a computer with an internet connection is needed to use it .
After identifying the model to be repa@@ ired by its vehicle identification number , an effective graphic image of the model appears , and then the necessary part is selected .
The user can include variables such as the price of labor , sur@@ charges and discounts , and can then print the estimate for the client .
Au@@ da@@ T@@ aller is not an app@@ ra@@ is@@ al tool like Au@@ da@@ Plus , but rather a reference catalog .
The main difference is that the system aimed at gar@@ ages does not include labor time estimates .
The cost of using this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year , which the customer can finance .
Pres@@ ently , Au@@ dat@@ ex is working to make these images three-@@ dimensional .
This is an innovation mechan@@ ics are appro@@ ving of because it will enable you , for example , to select a door and turn it around to see the inside .
Prague Stock Market falls to min@@ us by the end of the trading day
After a sharp drop in the morning , the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses .
Trans@@ actions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise ( Č@@ E@@ Z ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading .
The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday &apos;s trading , when it dropped by nearly six percent .
This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop .
The reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the American House of Represent@@ atives , which refused to support the plan for the stabili@@ zation of the financial sector there , has manifest@@ ed itself here as well .
Sto@@ cks fall in Asia
Sto@@ cks in the Asian markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday , even though the inde@@ xes ultimately er@@ ased a part of the losses during the day .
The H@@ ang Sen@@ g Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange wrote off nearly four percent during the day , but later it er@@ ased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to roughly 2.5 percent .
The H@@ ang Sen@@ g China Enter@@ prises Index , which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the stock market in Hong Kong , dropped by 3.@@ 8 percent , in Shanghai the markets were closed .
Sto@@ cks on the market in Sydney lost more than five percent , but ultimately lower@@ ed their losses to 4.@@ 3 percent .
The stock exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.@@ 6 percent according to the local index .
&quot; The timing of the ba@@ il@@ out action in the USA is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world , &quot; re@@ marked the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board , Joseph Y@@ am .
Despite the fact that it is a part of China , Hong Kong determines its currency policy separately , that is , without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank .
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States .
American legislat@@ ors should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system , according to Australian Prime Minister Kev@@ in Ru@@ d@@ d .
Otherwise there re@@ pu@@ tedly lo@@ oms the threat that other countries will also feel the imp@@ acts .
American stock bloo@@ d@@ bath
On Monday the American House of Represent@@ atives rejected the plan to support the financial system , into which up to 700 billion dollars ( nearly 12 billion Czech cro@@ wns ) was to be invested .
The legislat@@ ors thus ignored President George Bush &apos;s appeal for them to support the plan .
According to Bush , the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabili@@ ze the entire economy .
American stocks suffered a bloo@@ d@@ bath on Monday and the major stock inde@@ xes registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years .
The Do@@ w Jones Index dropped by nearly seven percent , having registered a simil@@ ar@@ ly-@@ ran@@ ged fall the last time in 1987 .
The index had dropped even prior to the vote , but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House , the index went into free fall .
Congress yiel@@ ds : US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and George W. Bush &apos;s cab@@ inet have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system .
The vote on it will take place at the beginning of next week .
American legislat@@ ors made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a ba@@ il@@ out plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amoun@@ ting to 700 billion dollars ( approximately 12 billion cro@@ wns ) .
But all is not won yet .
That is , the members of congress have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it .
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives on Monday .
The chair of the Financial Services Committee , Bar@@ ney Frank , told Re@@ uters this on Sunday .
S@@ ources say that the sen@@ ate could evi@@ dently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the so@@ on@@ est .
Econom@@ ists say that the announcement that the ba@@ il@@ out plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor significant to the revi@@ val of financial markets .
After@@ ward , however , a &quot; so@@ ber@@ ing up &quot; will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice .
Pau@@ l@@ son : Plan must be effective
&quot; We &apos;ve made great progress .
We &apos;ve resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabili@@ zation of markets should look , &quot; Democra@@ t N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si told Blo@@ om@@ berg .
According to her , the final vote could take place as early as Sunday .
Represent@@ atives of the legislat@@ ors met with American Finance Minister Henry Pau@@ l@@ son Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form .
The fund is meant to purchase un@@ s@@ ell@@ able mort@@ gage assets which are pul@@ ling financial companies down into heavy losses and are en@@ danger@@ ing the stability of the entire system .
&quot; We &apos;re on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market .
It &apos;s necessary to continue in the cu@@ rative plan , but I think we &apos;re there , &quot; Pau@@ l@@ son said .
A signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is significantly imp@@ acting the stock markets , which are drop@@ ping shar@@ ply .
According to Nevada Democratic sen@@ ator Harry Rei@@ d , that is how that legislat@@ ors are trying to have Congress to reach a definitive agreement as early as on Sunday .
Nam@@ ely , by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets , which , given their time zones , are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday &apos;s trading .
In the meantime , however , it is not yet clear with any certainty when both cham@@ bers of the American Congress will vote on the bill , nor whether the negotiations will not become hin@@ dered by some problem .
The legislat@@ ors hope that it will be approved in the next few days .
However , the bill will still go through a series of changes .
The total amount designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts .
The initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible , as requested by president George Bush .
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount , in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later , the final 350 billion dollars , if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function .
Bush appreci@@ ates progress in negotiations
Though the president can veto this decision , Congress can over@@ ride his veto .
Even in spite of these changes , the essential idea of the program , to gain finances for the bu@@ y@@ out of bad mort@@ gage stocks , the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mort@@ g@@ ages , has remained in@@ tact .
&quot; We &apos;ve drawn it all up .
The House of Represent@@ atives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Sen@@ ate on Monday , &quot; said Republi@@ can sen@@ ator Ju@@ d@@ d Greg@@ g .
Even American president Bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations .
His speaker Tony F@@ rat@@ to declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday &apos;s progress and appreciated the &quot; two-@@ party effort to stabili@@ ze our financial markets and save our economy &quot; .
Con@@ stra@@ ining golden par@@ ach@@ utes
The chairman of the Sen@@ ate Banking Committee , Christop@@ her Do@@ d@@ d , the chief negoti@@ ator , said that the legislat@@ ors had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program , protection of the taxpayers against losses , closing of relief packages , and timing of the financial plan .
The new law is also meant to constra@@ in the &quot; golden par@@ ach@@ utes &quot; for the heads of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will over@@ see the fund .
The committee is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance .
&quot; We &apos;ve worked very hard on this and we &apos;ve made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans , &quot; Pau@@ l@@ son said .
The plan also includes assistance to home@@ owners who have problems making their payments .
The cab@@ inet should negotiate new payments for the mort@@ g@@ ages it bu@@ ys , with the aim of lower@@ ing the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their houses .
Ma@@ re@@ k : Psych@@ ological help
According to the chief econom@@ ist of Patri@@ a Finance , David Ma@@ re@@ k , the proposed plan is a good idea , but its realization will be very difficult .
&quot; And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be bought .
This will determine how the financial sector and the cab@@ inet will divide the losses amongst themselves , &quot; Ma@@ re@@ k told the server i@@ HN@@ ed@@ .@@ cz this week .
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant , according to Ma@@ re@@ k .
&quot; More important is for the members of congress to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible .
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time , &quot; Ma@@ re@@ k emphasi@@ zed .
R@@ az@@ or &apos;s edge battle : MP3 players v@@ s. cell phones .
Our advice on how to choose
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files , no MP3 player can make phone calls .
This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone .
In spite of this , there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player .
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner .
It is not likely that you will get a top-@@ of-the-@@ line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Max@@ im Tur@@ bul@@ en@@ c .
First of all such music products not available on L@@ Ps , but also , from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it .
However , if your shel@@ ves are crow@@ ded with art rock , jazz , or blu@@ es vin@@ yl records , you are likely at least dre@@ aming of a record player like that .
It &apos;s the same with music on trips , that is , com@@ pressed music , simply put , MP3 music .
There are price and qualitative categories here as well .
For some , it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand cro@@ wns on an MP3 player , just as it is hard for P@@ ink Flo@@ y@@ d fan to accept twenty-@@ cro@@ wn head@@ phones from a market hall .
Two extre@@ mes , between which there is enough space for everyone .
The selection is broad .
Bat@@ tery life also decides
Some top-@@ of-the-@@ line music players can do much more than merely play music , but also what most cell phones can &apos;t even do by chance .
No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone .
In addition to the primary functions , calling and tex@@ ting , it can play music and video , record both , contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navi@@ gate in some cases .
And when we take smart phones and communication devices , you have a small computer in your po@@ cket .
It &apos;s a small mi@@ racle , as there is no refriger@@ ator that knows how to gri@@ ll and no television can take pictures .
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings dis@@ advantages .
The more functions you use on your cell phone , the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the char@@ ger .
And playing music is one of the biggest energy gu@@ zz@@ lers .
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours , most of them much less .
In this way , music players ( particularly the sim@@ pl@@ est ones ) are much more efficient .
Which is why you should count on the fact that in@@ expensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours .
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that , to be on the safe side , get another char@@ ger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices .
You won &apos;t have this problem with MP3 players , even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge .
Another problem arises when recording music on the cell phone .
Unfortunately , only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connec@@ tor , and on top of that , not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software .
Of course , music can be recorded directly onto a memory card , but very few card readers can handle the mini@@ ature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adap@@ tor .
For the music players , with some exceptions ( iPod ) , you don &apos;t need any special software .
It &apos;s enough to fill the device with music using the USB from the computer .
Most cell phones and music players already create a music library by themselves , organized according to the artist &apos;s name , album title , gen@@ re , or , e.g. , user rating .
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory , similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both ( i@@ river , Samsung , Sony , Co@@ won , smart phones with an operating systems ) .
Music players easier to service , cell phones can do more
In choosing specific equipment , you should be interested above all in the life of the battery , the capacity of the memory , the quality and type of the audio output , and of course also the user-@@ friendly nature of the operation .
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while , perhaps in the tram , any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough .
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do .
You don &apos;t even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle .
The MP3 can handle all of them , and in fact , most of the music you will get will be in this very format .
It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it , the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in W@@ MA format .
L@@ ess common is the appearance of A@@ AC ( the format used by the Apple company and its iPo@@ ds ) .
Better cell phones , at the same time , enable the purchase of music on-line .
All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator ( or another provider ) using mobile Internet .
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell phone .
Unfortunately the offer@@ ings from the operators are pal@@ try and are usually limited to fast@@ -@@ growing radio h@@ its .
The prices are also not among the lowest .
It is generally assumed , however , that this very manner of music sales ( whether using G@@ SM , the Internet or wireless Internet ) will take over the music industry in the future .
Most people have their cell phone on them at all times .
Whenever you feel like listening to something , you can reach for your cell phone in your po@@ cket , while the MP3 player lies at home , forgotten .
However , it still depends on whether you always have head@@ phones or at least the wire hand@@ s-@@ free with you .
If not , you can utili@@ ze the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones , but only in a minimum of MP3 players .
But the greatest advantage of the music cell phones for many people is the price .
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand cro@@ wns .
For three or four thousand cro@@ wns , you can get a very decent wal@@ k@@ man .
U@@ su@@ ally , however , you &apos;ll be limited by the absence of output on ordinary head@@ phones .
The best and most technically well-@@ equipped teleph@@ ones , with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary head@@ phones , cost up to fifteen thousand cro@@ wns .
The advantage of the music players , on the other hand , is , among other reasons , that they are easy to operate .
Anyone can handle the operation of the sim@@ pl@@ est - not necessarily the most in@@ expensive ( see our selection ) - music players .
The minimum of functions and simil@@ arity in operation to the formerly common c@@ ass@@ ette rec@@ order or even the record player is apparent .
There is no threat of a clas@@ h in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data transmission .
What device to reach for
Even the least expensive cell phones ( e.g. Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one 5@@ 27 ) generally have a slot for replac@@ eable memory cards ( of the type M@@ 2 , micro@@ SD and the like ) .
Even with the additional purchase of the respective card , you will spend less than two thousand cro@@ wns .
Be careful , however .
With the basic models , only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported .
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards .
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an in@@ expensive MP3 player , reach for Co@@ won , Cre@@ ativ , Sony , Samsung , Em@@ get@@ on or i@@ river .
Based on capacity ( maximum 2 GB ) you don &apos;t have to spend more than 1,@@ 100 cro@@ wns .
If you are a more demanding listen@@ er , reach instead for specialized cell phones - wal@@ k@@ man ( Sony Ericsson , some Nokia and Samsung models ) .
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-@@ friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player .
Sony Ericsson , whose cell phones from the wal@@ k@@ man series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately , is the most advanced in the field .
The MP3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand cro@@ wns , but with a greater memory capacity ( up to 16 GB ) and battery en@@ dur@@ ance ( normally 15 hours , maxim@@ ally up to 35 hours ) .
First virtual operator to arrive in Cze@@ ch@@ ia this year .
Maybe
The mobile market in Cze@@ ch@@ ia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe .
In spite of this , there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices .
It might be missing for a long time .
We have already written many times on Mobil@@ .@@ cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe .
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unications Bureau , who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union .
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the ro@@ aming fees , a parado@@ x@@ ical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home .
How is it possible that the prices in Cze@@ ch@@ ia remain so high in comparison with Europe ?
The answer is simple , there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle .
Perhaps it sounds parado@@ x@@ ical , after all , we have three mobile networks here and over 100 % coverage .
Mobile operators , on the other hand , like to pre@@ tend that the Czech market is extremely competitive .
This is often secon@@ ded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unications Bureau ( CT@@ B ) P@@ av@@ el D@@ vo@@ ř@@ á@@ k , who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Cze@@ ch@@ ia .
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance ( for that matter , it would be very difficult to find frequ@@ encies ) .
But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator .
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lower@@ ing of prices , to which even the classic operators had to react .
At the same time , even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as T@@ esco Mobile or Virgin Mobile , voices similar to those here could be heard .
But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful .
For that matter , we don &apos;t have to go far to find examples .
In February of this year , we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobil@@ king in Poland .
Over the course of merely half a year , this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator .
At the same time , the financial group P@@ enta , which own@@ s , among others , U : f@@ on , stands behind Mobil@@ king .
The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group .
In order to function effectively , they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does .
That is , they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction , operation and maintenance of a mobile network .
In this way , virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-@@ cost - they offer in@@ expensive calling and text messages , which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services , though .
That &apos;s how , for example , T@@ esco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text mess@@ aging for at least fif@@ ty percent less than its competitors .
But as the example of Mobil@@ king in Poland shows , it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group .
That is , this operator is specifically oriented toward men .
&quot; Real men choose Mobil@@ king - the operator that they like and can trust , &quot; says David Sei@@ bert , the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company , which runs this virtual operator .
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here .
Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Č@@ ep@@ i@@ ck@@ ý , spo@@ kes@@ man for Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one , doubts this : &quot; The Czech market is relatively small for the seg@@ mented approach on which most virtual operators are founded .
In addition , it &apos;s relatively sat@@ ur@@ ated from the perspective of the offer of services . &quot;
No chance in Cze@@ ch@@ ia , say mobile operators
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Cze@@ ch@@ ia , it won &apos;t be Mobil@@ king .
&quot; We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project , but the negotiations in Cze@@ ch@@ ia don &apos;t look very hop@@ e@@ ful .
More likely , Mobil@@ king will be launched in other countries in our region , &quot; said Jan@@ a Stu@@ d@@ ni@@ č@@ kov@@ á , speaker for the P@@ enta financial group , in a telephone interview for Mobil@@ .@@ cz .
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Cze@@ ch@@ ia are definitely not inc@@ lined toward this idea .
Rather , on the contrary , they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competi@@ tor comes into existence .
For a longer period of time now , the GT@@ S No@@ ver@@ a group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator , and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competi@@ tor of Telefon@@ ica O@@ 2 in the area of corporate cli@@ ent@@ ele .
&quot; We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hard@@ wire telecomm@@ unication services , but also mobile ones .
The sooner , the better .
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators .
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them , &quot; said the group &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man , P@@ av@@ el Ka@@ id@@ l .
Perhaps there are better times ahead .
On the basis of un@@ official information , it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year .
In the meantime , however , its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence .
&quot; At this time , we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-@@ fle@@ dged virtual operator .
Comp@@ ared to other markets , the Czech market is very specific .
No subject has appro@@ ached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area , &quot; claimed V@@ las@@ tim@@ il S@@ r@@ š@@ e@@ ň from the public relations department of Telefon@@ ica 02 in a statement for Mobil@@ .@@ cz .
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market .
In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O@@ 2 , T-@@ Mobile spo@@ kes@@ woman Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ rov@@ á added : &quot; We have not yet registered a viable and bilater@@ ally advanta@@ geous business project that it would be possible to build upon . &quot;
And she added : &quot; No virtual operator is likely to appear in the T-@@ Mobile network by the end of the year .
At this moment , in order to be talking about such a short time@@ frame , we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table . &quot;
Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3@@ G license .
Regarding this , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Č@@ ep@@ i@@ ck@@ ý said : &quot; We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators , above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure .
From the perspective of the customers , we consider this to be the most beneficial .
Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one &apos;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet . &quot;
Respon@@ sible authorities - bud@@ d@@ y-@@ bud@@ dy with operators
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand , the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition , it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits .
Why , then , make this entrance easy for such a competi@@ tor ?
The tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war surrounding the creation of U : f@@ on at@@ tests to the fact that when something is important to the operators , they are able to pull for the same team .
Pro@@ b@@ ably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unication Office was during the time of the creation of U : f@@ on by T-@@ Mobile .
Information publicly available from the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unication Office &apos;s web pages at@@ tests to this .
But now this is a suitable argument for U : f@@ on to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator .
Regarding that matter , Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ rov@@ á pointed out : &quot; The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently ampli@@ fied by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market .
Consi@@ dering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic , it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services . &quot;
But considering this approach by the mobile operators , the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is , in fact , star@@ tling .
This means not only the attitude of the C@@ TO , which unfortunately in Cze@@ ch@@ ia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition .
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition ( O@@ PC ) exclusively .
But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue .
&quot; The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator .
No such contract has ever been signed , because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators , &quot; claimed Kris@@ ti@@ án Chal@@ up@@ a from the external relations department of the O@@ PC in his answer to our question .
A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won &apos;t surprise anyone .
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and , among other things , make sure that no one abuses his / her position on the market , it is more than serious .
All the more so when Kris@@ ti@@ án Chal@@ up@@ a added : &quot; In other countries , where virtual operators commonly function , we can observe that their entrance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services . &quot;
But evi@@ dently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the O@@ PC .
In truth , the sho@@ cking element of the whole case is the almost flu@@ id harmony between the three mobile operators that is implic@@ it in their reactions .
The question as to whether this is really just a coinci@@ dence arises entirely by itself .
Just like the exact same price of gas@@ ol@@ ine at the gas stations is surely just the product of coinci@@ dence and the tough competitive battle .
&quot; The Office did not find any signs of actions viol@@ ating the rules of competition , and thus has no reason to intervene in any way .
None of the operators have a dominant position , and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market .
The telecommunications regul@@ ator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtual operators , &quot; Chal@@ up@@ a claimed in his statement .
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disp@@ uted points .
Of course , an analysis of the relevant markets does exist , conducted by C@@ TO , according to which telecommunications are , from the perspective of competition , the only market .
On such a market , none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position .
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator , it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator .
And the mobile operator - entirely lo@@ gi@@ cally - has a monopoly on its network .
So in a certain segment , it must necessarily be dominant .
But even if we did not consider this argument , for the O@@ PC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proce@@ eding in a stri@@ k@@ ingly similar manner .
At the same time , complaints from a series of interested parties ( including the GT@@ S No@@ ver@@ a company mentioned above ) demonstrate that they are encounter@@ ing very similar hur@@ d@@ les in their negotiations with all the operators .
Pl@@ ac@@ ing the responsibility on the C@@ TO is a rather common tri@@ ck in telecommunications , through which the O@@ PC can have nothing to do with the whole matter .
We have already encountered it in several similar cases .
Unfortunately , it was not possible to establish the extension of the C@@ TO &apos;s authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telec@@ omm@@ unications Act , even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation .
The representatives of the O@@ PC must know this very well , but their interests are evi@@ dently elsewhere .
It can be done when nobody &apos;s looking
At the same time , the functioning of some p@@ seu@@ do-@@ virtual operators , of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks , remains un@@ noticed .
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services , which are only partially public .
These are usually companies dealing with multi@@ level marketing .
For example , Am@@ way , Boh@@ em@@ ia Telec@@ om , Star@@ life and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services .
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals .
The tri@@ ck lies in the fact that , in relation to the operator , the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SI@@ M cards .
As a significant client , it then gets special price offers ( and other types of offers ) .
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohi@@ bit such advance sales .
&quot; If the cases you are talking about were to occur , this could be a violation of the contract conditions , which we would investigate , and it could cul@@ min@@ ate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company , &quot; Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ rov@@ á answered our question on this problem .
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators .
This could be a question of thousands of customers , above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above .
But at the same time , none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure .
Nam@@ ely , they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing .
Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Č@@ ep@@ i@@ ck@@ ý draws attention to potential problems : &quot; The law enables such speculation , nevertheless only an in@@ significant percentage of customers use the services of these companies .
On top of that , they must accept that the SI@@ M card in their telephone is not registered under their name , and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can . &quot;
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the C@@ TO .
In addition , another question for the O@@ PC arises .
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure , why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ?
It must be added that the O@@ PC has rather considerable power to un@@ cover such activities , and if it does not wish to , it does not have to be satisfied with operators &apos; claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohi@@ bit it .
When we won &apos;t be the most expensive
As mentioned already several times in this article , the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services .
At the same time , classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created .
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small , too sat@@ ur@@ ated , problems with the quality of services , etc .
But in developed countries , the regulatory organs , which supported the interests not of the mobile operators , but of their customers , interven@@ ed at that very moment .
Ei@@ ther through formal measures or informal pressure , they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator , and others continued in its foot@@ steps .
Unfortunately , the Czech regulatory organs have been to@@ ss@@ ing the whole case back and forth like a hot pot@@ ato .
Based on our experience , we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in compet@@ encies in these cases suits them very well .
But let &apos;s not throw in the to@@ wel .
If the behin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon , the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again .
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator , it will be difficult for O@@ PC to be able to remain in@@ different to the refusal ( discrimination ) of further interested parties .
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe .
New Czech national an@@ them has four new versions .
Choose the best one
Listen to the four ren@@ der@@ ings of the new version of the Czech national an@@ them .
On Sunday Prime Minister Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k presented the new recordings of the national an@@ them K@@ de dom@@ ov m@@ ů@@ j ( Where is my Country ) on the occasion of the Day of Czech Stat@@ eh@@ ood .
The an@@ them was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Ji@@ ř@@ í B@@ ě@@ loh@@ l@@ á@@ ve@@ k .
Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo voc@@ als , a ch@@ oral version and an instru@@ mental version .
K@@ ate@@ ř@@ ina Kn@@ ě@@ ž@@ í@@ n@@ kov@@ á and Adam Pla@@ ch@@ et@@ ka did the singing .
The authors of the arrangements of the an@@ them are O@@ ta@@ k@@ ar Jer@@ em@@ i@@ á@@ š and J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Kr@@ č@@ ek .
You can listen to all four versions on the server i@@ HN@@ ed@@ .@@ cz .
B@@ ě@@ loh@@ l@@ á@@ ve@@ k considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national anth@@ ems .
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had inten@@ tionally selected sing@@ ers with young , representative voices that were striking and popular for the solo vari@@ ants .
&quot; From the beginning , with both of them and also with the ch@@ or@@ us , I tried to make sure that they had clear artic@@ ulation , so that the text could be understood well , so that they were in harmony , &quot; he said .
The Czech national an@@ them will celebrate its 17@@ 5th anniversary next year .
The song K@@ de dom@@ ov m@@ ů@@ j ( Where is my Country ) was heard for the first time in 18@@ 34 on the stage of the E@@ states Theater in the original Czech play Fi@@ d@@ lo@@ va@@ č@@ ka by Josef Ka@@ jet@@ án Ty@@ l with the music of Fran@@ ti@@ š@@ ek Š@@ kro@@ up .
It gained popularity and the people spon@@ tane@@ ously took it as their own .
The first stan@@ za of the song then became a natural part of the national an@@ them following the creation of Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia in 19@@ 18 .
It remained one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent Czech Republic .
How the &quot; new &quot; hy@@ m@@ n sounds
Prague City M@@ ass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday , October 1 , 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first travellers board the metro , tra@@ ms and buses with an electronic cou@@ p@@ on in their po@@ ckets instead of a paper ticket .
The roughly one hundred thousand people in possession of their own chip card Open@@ card at this time can get this cou@@ p@@ on .
Trav@@ ellers can buy a 30-@@ day , 9@@ 0-@@ day and year-@@ long cou@@ p@@ on ( which will be valid beginning on January 1 , 2009 ) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Mu@@ ze@@ um , M@@ ů@@ ste@@ k , N@@ á@@ dra@@ ž@@ í Hol@@ e@@ š@@ o@@ vice , And@@ ě@@ l , Ro@@ z@@ ty@@ ly , Let@@ ň@@ any , K@@ ob@@ y@@ li@@ sy , Ra@@ j@@ ská zah@@ ra@@ da , Ka@@ č@@ ero@@ v and Lu@@ ka .
Beg@@ inning yesterday , cou@@ p@@ ons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Company , www.@@ d@@ pp@@ .@@ cz .
By the afternoon , more than four hundred customers had used the service .
Those beginning to use Internet shopping can definiti@@ vely forget about the ven@@ ding windows in the metro stations , where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets .
That is , they can buy the cou@@ p@@ on over the Internet and it will be added to the Open@@ card at one of the thir@@ teen branches of the City Library .
&quot; At these locations , there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase , and will also add the purchased cou@@ p@@ on to their card , &quot; said the project &apos;s speaker , Martin Op@@ at@@ r@@ n@@ ý .
In addition to libraries , it will also be possible to add the electronic cou@@ p@@ ons to the Open@@ card at the self-@@ service machines which have been set up in several v@@ esti@@ b@@ ules of the metro .
What do these self-@@ service machines look like ?
They are red , res@@ emb@@ ling ticket vali@@ dation machines , and travellers might have already noticed them in the metro stations Ro@@ z@@ ty@@ ly , Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vi@@ ck@@ á , I. P. P@@ av@@ lo@@ va , Flor@@ en@@ c and V@@ l@@ ta@@ v@@ ská .
&quot; Now there are five of them in the city , but by the end of the year there should be eigh@@ ty of them , &quot; Op@@ at@@ r@@ n@@ ý added .
Cou@@ p@@ on checked by self-@@ service machine instead of driver
Using the self-@@ service machines , which will begin functioning tomorrow , is simple .
All you have to do is insert the Open@@ card chip card , and the pre-@@ paid card is automatically added to it .
The electronic cou@@ p@@ ons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city , but in its surroundings as well .
That is , in sub@@ urban trains and bus lines num@@ ber@@ ed 300 to 4@@ 99 , which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Boh@@ em@@ ian towns to travel into the capital city .
&quot; In trains included in Prague Integr@@ ated Transport , the conduc@@ tors are equipped with card readers , with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons , &quot; Fili@@ p Dr@@ á@@ p@@ al from the organization R@@ op@@ id , which creates the timet@@ ables of the Prague M@@ ass Transport , explained the ti@@ ck@@ et-@@ checking procedures .
The sub@@ urban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver &apos;s seat .
Upon boarding , it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver , but in addition it is necessary to place the Open@@ card on the designated spot on the side of the cash register .
This is how the driver checks the validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons recorded .
&quot; If the trav@@ eller needs to confirm the validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons recorded , there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver , &quot; Dr@@ á@@ p@@ al added .
Tra@@ vel@@ ers who do not use sub@@ urban buses , and will not remember when the validity of a cou@@ p@@ on ends , can head again for the self-@@ service machines where the cou@@ p@@ ons are added to the card .
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine &apos;s screen .
Su@@ de@@ ten@@ lands wanted referendum from USA
Su@@ deten Germans requested that the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region be incorporated into the United States in 1945 .
This is implic@@ it in a letter stored in the collections of the South Boh@@ em@@ ia Research Library .
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria , we wish at least to live under the patron@@ age of the United States .
Several groups of Su@@ deten Germans supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type .
This arises from , among other things , a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Boh@@ em@@ ia Research Library .
In the letter , Germans from Č@@ esk@@ ý K@@ rum@@ lov request that the American president not to allow the return of the &quot; Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region &quot; - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia .
&quot; We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as op@@ press@@ ors and enemies , but rather , as liber@@ ators , &quot; is what is written in the letter , signed &quot; People who are not in@@ different to the fate of Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va &quot; .
Since the anne@@ x@@ ation by Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia supposedly only gives the Su@@ deten Germans hope for - knowing the Czech national character - brut@@ ality , dis@@ regard , lack of understanding , op@@ pression and sla@@ very , the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protec@@ torate of Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va forever .
&quot; We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people , you would award this territory to a state foreign to us , which op@@ pres@@ ses and opp@@ u@@ gn@@ s minorities and which has contributed nothing , absolutely nothing , to the victory of the Al@@ lies , &quot; is written in the letter .
The reason why the authors could not sign their names was the supposed fear of re@@ ven@@ ge by the &quot; Czech op@@ press@@ ors &quot; .
If the president of the USA were to supposedly have doubts about the persu@@ asion of the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va Germans , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region on whether its inhabitants want to become a part of the USA or live under the patron@@ age of the United States .
Though the text of the letter may sound a bit na@@ ï@@ ve given the contemporary knowledge of post-@@ war history , according to some witn@@ esses it appropriately sk@@ et@@ ches the expectations of the Su@@ deten Germans at that time .
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that their displac@@ ement from the country would be discussed , almost none of them admitted this possibility at all .
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a certain type of autonomy for the Su@@ de@@ ten@@ lands .
Others believed that they would simply remain in Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia .
The famous journalist Gu@@ sta@@ v Chal@@ up@@ a , born in Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice , also confirms this .
As a German from Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice , he was sent to the n@@ avy in the Baltic Sea during the war .
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Hol@@ stein , tens of other Czech Germans went to him so that he would teach them Czech .
&quot; They believed that when they returned home , Czech would come in handy , &quot; Chal@@ up@@ a said .
According to him , none of the German prisoners living in Cze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ akia before the war envisaged being displaced from the re@@ public on the basis of the Ben@@ e@@ š Dec@@ re@@ es .
You don &apos;t think - you pay !
Emo@@ tive campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history .
That &apos;s also one way to character@@ ize the emo@@ tive media campaign which the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation plans to launch on Wednesday .
The office of minister Ale@@ š Ř@@ eb@@ í@@ č@@ ek hopes that it will discou@@ rage drivers from be@@ having danger@@ ously behind the wheel .
The 15@@ 0-@@ milli@@ on-@@ cro@@ wn campaign will appear on television , on the radio , in cin@@ em@@ as , on the Internet , but also on fl@@ yers .
It should discou@@ rage drivers from spee@@ ding and driving under the influence of alcohol .
And also remind them to fa@@ sten their se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts before they start driving .
Above all , it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers , motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts , pedestri@@ ans , and last but not least , professional drivers .
And what appears in the spots ?
Main@@ ly human stories that attack the emotions .
And even the &quot; bloo@@ dy &quot; s@@ logan of the whole campaign at@@ tests to this :
You don &apos;t think - you pay !
The words &quot; you don &apos;t think &quot; are written in capital letters on a license plate .
And then the words &quot; you pay &quot; are in a pool of blood .
This is meant to symboli@@ ze that a person can pay for a moment of care@@ less@@ ness with his / her own life .
The spots will &quot; ha@@ unt &quot; the vie@@ wers until 2010 .
The mini@@ stry found inspiration in similar campaigns in An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ on countries , where it is common to find pictures with dra@@ stic images of accident victims .
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease .
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RS@@ C@@ G .
Su@@ gar and whi@@ p for drivers
&quot; The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whi@@ p system .
The sugar for them is , for example , when they run a red light , they save time .
The whi@@ p is the threat of a fine or an accident .
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk , &quot; says Martin Ko@@ ř@@ án , a transportation psych@@ ologist from N@@ a Hom@@ ol@@ ce Hospital .
And that &apos;s why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary , the psych@@ ologist believes .
L@@ ess effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers &apos; attention to the danger .
&quot; If a static table which war@@ ns against danger is installed , it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it , &quot; Ko@@ ř@@ án warned .
Ol@@ m@@ ert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The prime minister of the provi@@ sional Israeli government , E@@ hu@@ d Ol@@ m@@ ert , expressed his opinion in favour of the re@@ stitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967 , that is , even Trans@@ j@@ ord@@ an , East Jerusalem and the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Syria .
He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ oth A@@ hr@@ on@@ oth on Monday .
&quot; We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians , which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the ( occupied ) territories , if not all of them , &quot; Ol@@ m@@ ert told the newspaper .
&quot; We will keep a certain percentage of these territories , but we will have to ce@@ de a similar percentage ( of Israeli territory ) to the Palestinians , because there will be no peace if we don &apos;t do that , &quot; he added .
He admitted that the possible re@@ stitution would also include East Jerusalem .
&quot; W@@ ho@@ ever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want trac@@ tors or bul@@ l@@ doz@@ ers to run over his or her legs , like what happened to one of my best friends , will have to give up a part of Jerusalem , &quot; Ol@@ m@@ ert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July , during which several people were killed and tens injured .
According to the prime minister , it will be necessary to find a &quot; special solution for the Temple Mount , a sac@@ red and historic place &quot; , which lies inside the Old City .
&quot; W@@ ho@@ ever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 27@@ 0@@ ,000 Ara@@ bs .
That won &apos;t work , &quot; he stressed further .
Le@@ aving Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts
Ol@@ m@@ ert also expressed his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with Syria .
But that would also require certain effort from Dam@@ as@@ cus .
&quot; I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , &quot; he warned .
&quot; The Syri@@ ans know well what they will have to give up in order to gain the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts .
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran ; they will have to give up their relationship to the ( Shi@@ -@@ ite movement ) He@@ z@@ bollah ; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to the terrorism of the ( Shi@@ -@@ ite movement ) Hamas , ( the terrorist network ) Al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da and the ji@@ had ( hol@@ y war ) in Iraq , &quot; the prime minister specified .
Questions after accident : Are ste@@ wards in the bus illegal ?
Law doesn &apos;t know them , walking in coach bus not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Stu@@ dent Agency near Pad@@ ua , Italy , the question has ar@@ isen as to whether ste@@ wards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion .
&quot; If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law , the activities of the ste@@ ward are in conflict with the Traff@@ ic Law , &quot; says speaker for the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation Karel Han@@ zel@@ ka .
The accident , during which a twenty-@@ two-@@ year-old ste@@ war@@ d@@ ess died last week , was evi@@ dently caused by the driver of the truck that cro@@ ssed into the path of the bus .
Un@@ lu@@ ck@@ ily , at that moment , the girl was sitting next to the driver , in the least safe place in the vehicle , even though there are two more seats reserved for her .
However , the bus can crash or bra@@ ke shar@@ ply even when the ste@@ ward is hand@@ ing out coffee or newspapers .
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role .
If this is not approved in the bus , the passengers must sit .
The Stu@@ dent Agency coach buses do not have standing room ; which the head of the company , Radi@@ m Jan@@ č@@ ura , also confirmed for Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz .
&quot; We tried to find a solution to this with the mini@@ stry , and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers .
Event@@ ually they re@@ vo@@ ked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat , &quot; he conve@@ yed his position .
The law does not know the ste@@ ward
&quot; There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the ste@@ ward - no legal en@@ act@@ ments deal with this role .
However , nor do any legal en@@ act@@ ments prohi@@ bit the transpor@@ ters from providing services .
The Traff@@ ic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor ; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person , &quot; speaker Han@@ zel@@ ka added less un@@ ambigu@@ ously .
The head of the Department of Motor V@@ eh@@ ic@@ le Operation of the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation , Josef Po@@ kor@@ n@@ ý , on the contrary , said that the law tre@@ ats this issue sufficiently .
&quot; It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification .
That &apos;s all there is to it , &quot; he says .
B@@ uses are divided into the categories of city bus , where there is standing room and limited maximum speed , inter-@@ city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted , and coach buses , with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat bel@@ ts .
Like in an air@@ plane , says expert
J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Ho@@ ř@@ ín , an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traff@@ ic Safety ( B@@ ES@@ IP ) , does not see any essential problem in the movement of ste@@ wards on the buses .
&quot; During a smooth ride , there is not much threat of danger , the situation can be compared to the service in air@@ planes .
Even there it is not certain when tur@@ bul@@ ence will occur and the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ess can hit her head . &quot;
&quot; However , if the bus were to bra@@ ke shar@@ ply , of course , the laws of physi@@ cs are valid .
Just like in a city bus or a tram .
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the ste@@ wards through internal regulations , &quot; he says , and he also thinks that from the legal perspective , this issue is un@@ resolved .
Jan@@ č@@ ura willing to dis@@ continue services
Stu@@ dent Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the ste@@ ward service .
It emplo@@ ys nearly two hundred of them .
Even after the accident , the head does not consider their job to be ris@@ ky .
&quot; But as soon as I gain the impression that the ste@@ wards &apos; job is ris@@ ky , I will dis@@ continue them .
Pas@@ sen@@ gers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding .
It would also save costs , &quot; he says .
Alex@@ e@@ j Lit@@ vin , head of Asi@@ ana , which operates a fra@@ ction of the bus lines that SA does , explained the absence of ste@@ wards in his vehicles as due to safety interests .
&quot; We don &apos;t have ste@@ war@@ d@@ esses , we &apos;ve been against it from the very beginning .
So@@ oner or later it will end in a fat@@ al accident , &quot; he told T@@ ý@@ den@@ .@@ cz nearly a year ago .
En@@ or@@ mous tragedy occurred
A young ste@@ war@@ d@@ ess from the Pil@@ sen area , who had worked for the company for two years , died in an accident on the bus line to Naples .
A Slovenian trac@@ tor tra@@ iler truck likely left the emergency lane without sign@@ alling and blocked the path of the bus .
The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeu@@ vre , however , the front right part of the bus gra@@ zed it .
Jan@@ č@@ ura re@@ buff@@ s the claim that the two seats reserved for the ste@@ wards &apos; rest had been sold out .
&quot; It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses , they are blocked . &quot;
The company plans to su@@ e the driver of the truck .
The agency will not wait for the court verdi@@ ct to compensate the girl &apos;s family , but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party .
Adap@@ tation of the law ?
Far away
An adaptation of the law , on which a thir@@ ty-@@ member expert group from the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation has been working for over a year , could bring about the specification of the movement of ste@@ wards on board the buses .
&quot; But no concrete conclusion has been reached .
They are not dealing with buses much , it is more the point system , the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving , &quot; says expert Ho@@ ř@@ ín .
&quot; The Ministry of Transpor@@ tation does not consider the activity of the ste@@ wards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way , &quot; concludes speaker Han@@ zel@@ ka , adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office .
Du@@ es@@ sel@@ dorf Hop@@ es Rest in Frankfurt
In a letter from the West@@ L@@ B board of directors to the bank &apos;s employees , grand talk is not in short supply .
Com@@ bin@@ ing units of the Du@@ es@@ sel@@ dorf institution with Frankfurt &apos;s De@@ ka Bank , the notice made public on Monday claims , could `@@ create a major capit@@ al-@@ market institution of the Spar@@ k@@ assen Finanz@@ gruppe . &apos; 
West@@ L@@ B would contribute to the deal a `@@ blo@@ c of expertise &apos; with sustained earning power , it says .
Gener@@ ally , the letter suggests , this kind of join@@ ter might provide the pi@@ vot@@ al impul@@ se for further concentration in the area of the German state banks , the Landes@@ banken .
That &apos;s what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times .
The fla@@ gging West@@ L@@ B is still exposed to tremendous pressure , after all .
Not just from the EU Commission , but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Super@@ vision , which only recently warned the state government of North R@@ hin@@ e-@@ West@@ p@@ ha@@ lia that there was an urgent need for a solution .
But talks of some type of join@@ ter between De@@ ka Bank , which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment funds , and West@@ L@@ B have been making the rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt .
Pre@@ sent@@ ing the report on the first two quarters in late August , De@@ ka Bank head Franz Wa@@ as said a fusion between the institute on Main@@ zer Land@@ strasse and a Landes@@ bank , such as H@@ esse and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia &apos;s Hel@@ aba or West@@ L@@ B , made little sense to him .
But the administrative board of De@@ ka , which is owned in equal parts by the Landes@@ banken and the savings banks associations , has asked the board of directors to comm@@ ence talks with West@@ L@@ B on joint business vent@@ ures .
The possible subject is the capit@@ al-@@ market business , or parts of it .
Of course , as sources in the financial community point out , negotiations have only just begun .
It &apos;s not the first time that the name De@@ ka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation .
In 2003 , a mer@@ ger of De@@ ka Bank with Landes@@ bank R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ inate and Hel@@ aba briefly seemed to be within the realm of possibility .
But in the end , the thre@@ es@@ ome didn &apos;t happen .
As soon as the plans became public , the H@@ es@@ sian state government spoke out against the participation of Hel@@ aba .
The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement .
Instead , Landes@@ bank R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ inate was bought by Stuttgart &apos;s Landes@@ bank Baden-@@ Wu@@ er@@ ttem@@ berg .
But deliber@@ ations on a join@@ ter between De@@ ka Bank and Landes@@ banken have continued to rear their heads .
Most recently , Gu@@ en@@ ther Mer@@ l , chairman of the board at Hel@@ aba , had qu@@ elled considerations of a mer@@ ger with his institution .
This aside , there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative .
First up , now that the state elections in Bavaria are over , a join@@ ter between Bay@@ ern@@ L@@ B and the Landes@@ bank Baden-@@ Wu@@ er@@ ttem@@ berg may have become more likely .
For Hel@@ aba , that &apos;s not necessarily good news .
Should the pressure for more mer@@ gers increase , it will by degrees be running out of potential partners .
In the South , it would merely be a junior partner , although it has to date we@@ a@@ ther@@ ed the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart .
A mer@@ ger with West@@ L@@ B , in turn , was squ@@ ash@@ ed early this year by the Sav@@ ings Bank Association of H@@ esse and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia , which own@@ s 85 percent of Hel@@ aba .
Rem@@ a@@ ins only Nord@@ L@@ B .
But such geo@@ strategic considerations are only one side of the equ@@ ation .
On the other stands the question in how far the institutions &apos; different business models are compatible with another .
In June , Mer@@ l said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landes@@ banken had not yet been resolved by the German Sav@@ ings Bank Association .
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , West@@ L@@ B might also be split up , although , of course , that &apos;s not a solution fa@@ vo@@ red at West@@ L@@ B .
The letter from its board of directors , accordingly , voices the mani@@ fest desire for a `@@ comprehensive solution . &apos; 
Quite how this is re@@ conc@@ il@@ able with a join@@ ter between individual units of West@@ L@@ B and De@@ ka Bank remains to be seen .
Second Week@@ end at the `@@ Wi@@ esn &apos; Is Kno@@ wn as `@@ Italian Week@@ end@@ &apos;
For E@@ len@@ a it &apos;s the first time , for Lu@@ ca it &apos;s the third or fourth already .
But this time , he brought along his gir@@ l@@ friend E@@ len@@ a , and that changes everything , he says .
Beh@@ ind them , next to a five-@@ li@@ tre ke@@ g of Kaiser beer , stands a massi@@ vely built bear@@ ded man who is pro@@ ving to the approximately 200 Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest tourists just how deep the sounds are that his thro@@ at his capable of producing .
E@@ len@@ a first sla@@ ps Lu@@ ca , then k@@ is@@ ses him .
They came to Verona from Bologna .
From here , a parking lot for buses next to the rail@@ road station Pu@@ or@@ ta Nu@@ ova , four buses will de@@ part at 11 : 45 tonight , `@@ dest@@ in@@ azione Monaco , fest@@ a della bir@@ ra@@ .@@ ` E@@ stim@@ ated time of arrival : 6 : 30 AM .
Three buses are reserved for Itali@@ ans mainly , one is exclusively for Brazi@@ li@@ ans .
In one corner of the parking lot , the South Americans are already singing next to their flag . They were celeb@@ rating last night already .
And very lou@@ dly , too , says Marco Guar@@ da - too lou@@ dly for Itali@@ ans .
Marco , who we@@ ars a long coat with fa@@ ke fur lining and gl@@ asses with broad silver ear@@ pieces , own@@ s the buses .
They have been making trips to the Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest for five years now , three of them this year alone .
They travel at night , spend the day at the `@@ Wi@@ esn &apos; and head back home again at 10 : 30 PM .
Sta@@ ying over night would only generate unnecessary costs , Marco says .
The trip is 75 Euros , including a welcoming round of Kaiser beer , bre@@ wed according to the Bavarian P@@ urity Law , health insurance , as well as a German-@@ language guide - Marco en@@ rolled in a language course in Frankfurt .
And with no further ado , the buses head out into the night , on the auto@@ stra@@ da leading to `@@ Brenn@@ ero . &apos; 
There is no beer to be had yet .
So@@ on all is quiet in the bus , the travelers are as@@ le@@ ep .
As they should be - they are going to need their strength .
They stop in Bri@@ xen and in Holz@@ kir@@ chen , where dro@@ ves of other buses with Italian plates are making a final stop on the Autobahn 8 , right before Munich .
When Marco &apos;s group finally arri@@ ves , as planned , at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there .
E@@ len@@ a , Lu@@ ca and the others gather . Marco addresses them one last time to give them their mar@@ ching orders .
First up : P@@ ut on the yellow cap@@ s .
On the left side , they say `@@ Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest &apos; in Gothic type , next to the Internet address of Marco &apos;s travel agency , &quot; con@@ o@@ sc@@ er@@ si@@ vi@@ ag@@ gi@@ and@@ o.@@ it &quot; .
Second : `@@ When the doors of the beer tent open , you have to run ! &apos; Marco sh@@ outs into the morning .
`@@ R@@ un ! &apos; R@@ un and man the seats in the rear part of the tent .
`@@ Not in the front , or else we will block the entry . And not all yellow h@@ ats at the same tables - spread out in the room ! &apos;
It &apos;s 8.@@ 25 Euros per `@@ Maß , &apos; Marco scre@@ ams .
And don &apos;t forget to tip .
`@@ Show the security people that we be@@ have !
As soon as you abandon your seats , they &apos;re gone ! &apos;
Third : `@@ Be back here tonight at 10 : 30 sharp ! &apos; Under@@ stood ?
And off to the `@@ Wi@@ esn &apos; they go .
One of them is marking the way by t@@ ying yellow cap@@ s to trees , signs and even to campaign post@@ ers of a political party that &apos;s popular in Bavaria .
They want to be prepared for the retreat .
It is the second weekend at the `@@ Wi@@ esn , &apos; known as the `@@ Italian Week@@ end . &apos;

No Sle@@ ep for H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate Cre@@ di@@ tors
As recently as last week , German Finance Minister Pe@@ er Stein@@ bru@@ eck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable .
It &apos;s a good thing that the politi@@ cian used the term `@@ relatively , &apos; further inter@@ jec@@ ting that the German banking sector w@@ ouldn &apos;t be sp@@ ared by the crisis .
Because that &apos;s what happened this weekend .
The real-@@ estate bank H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate ( HR@@ E ) from Munich , which is listed in the DA@@ X stock index , is receiving credits in the billions from a con@@ sortium of German banks in order to be shi@@ el@@ ded against the market tur@@ bul@@ ences .
An individual close to the proceedings told Re@@ uters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total .
H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using , they said .
The money was coming from private as well as public banks , they added .
The news comes in the wake of losses at subsidiary Dep@@ fa .
According to a news report , the govern@@ ment-@@ funding bank had re@@ financed long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which , due to the mi@@ str@@ ust at the markets , is no longer a possibility .
In the first half-@@ year of 2008 , the bank &apos;s cash reserve had shr@@ un@@ k by 95 percent to 2.@@ 37 Euros , with the capital resource quota also slightly dec@@ lining from 1.@@ 6 to 1.@@ 45 percent .
The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to ni@@ l compared to the same period in the previous year , while earnings from wri@@ te-@@ ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liqui@@ dation of acc@@ ru@@ als from credit transactions had shr@@ un@@ k by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros .
The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through re@@ funds from down@@ stream accounting costs from restructuring the former Dep@@ fa Group , as well as from re@@ funds of interest according to the Fis@@ cal Code and from agency for group companies .
After going private in 1990 , the former govern@@ ment-@@ funding bank had initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-@@ es@@ ate credits , which were then outs@@ our@@ ced to A@@ are@@ al Bank .
Because earnings in classical govern@@ ment-@@ funding were sli@@ m , Dep@@ fa had diversi@@ fied internationally , increasingly eng@@ aging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint vent@@ ures between private investors and the government ( Publi@@ c-@@ Private Partnership , PP@@ P ) .
Now H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate has to indu@@ ce wri@@ te-@@ off@@ s according to the subsidiary &apos;s worth that will have a `@@ significant , material effect &apos; on the group &apos;s profit@@ -and-@@ loss statement , it said rather v@@ agu@@ ely .
As a matter of fact , the divi@@ dend has been om@@ it@@ ted .
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007 .
Since the acquisition of Dep@@ fa , H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate has been a significant finan@@ cer of government and infrastructure .
Because it does not have client deposits , it is more dependent on re@@ financing at the inter@@ bank market than other banks .
With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers , the extension of loans among banks has largely dri@@ ed up again , because banks are ho@@ ar@@ ding their assets .
For part of Dep@@ fa &apos;s loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion Euros - H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate annually requires short-term capital for re@@ financing .
According to H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate , the credits meet the group &apos;s financing requirements for the fore@@ see@@ able future , shi@@ el@@ ding the cor@@ poration from `@@ the influence of the currently largely incap@@ ac@@ it@@ ated international financial markets . &apos; 
Other sources say that , thanks to the credits , re@@ financing is covered until late 2009 .
HR@@ E chairman of the board Georg Fun@@ ke said that , in the fore@@ see@@ able future , the H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again , however .
The Deutsche Bundes@@ bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Super@@ vision ( Ba@@ F@@ in ) are now considering the H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate Group &apos;s market@@ ability to be secured .
On behalf of the bank &apos;s shareholders and credi@@ tors , it is to be hoped they are right .
But given the dynamics and the un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability of the crisis , things are likely to remain uncertain .
It &apos;s not even un@@ th@@ ink@@ able that not all of the financing will be needed .
The opposite cannot be dis@@ counted either , however .
After the bank was re@@ porte@@ dly close to in@@ sol@@ vent late Sunday night , even a ba@@ il@@ out , temporary as it is , is incap@@ able of eas@@ ing people &apos;s minds .
The price per share is drop@@ ping by 75 percent to 3.@@ 30 Euros .
B@@ ond prices are holding up reasonably well , mean@@ while .
W@@ here@@ as senior debts are hardly moving , junior bonds are drop@@ ping more significantly .
This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wu@@ er@@ ttem@@ berg H@@ yp@@ o and , understand@@ ably , to re@@ payment periods beyond 2009 .
To date , H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for specul@@ ative investment . After the financial crisis , as well as the bank &apos;s own hom@@ em@@ ade crisis caused by the acquisition of Dep@@ fa , however , their recover@@ ability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system .
As long as central banks , governments and less stri@@ cken corporate banks are still willing to support the system , bond settlement deadlines can be met .
Alternatively , that which nobody da@@ res to hope for yet right now comes to pass , and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months .
But considering that one report of partial nation@@ alization is ch@@ asing the next , a prob@@ ability bor@@ dering on certainty has now shr@@ un@@ k to a valid hope .
This may be causing some sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess nights for long-term credi@@ tors in particular , as they pon@@ der the question whether or not to abandon their exposure .
Shor@@ t-@@ term investors may at least use the line that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss car@@ r@@ y-@@ forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come .
Sy@@ lv@@ ana and the Secre@@ ts of the Ben@@ to Box
When Sy@@ lv@@ ana Hil@@ tro@@ p , 16 years old , is asked to introduce herself on her first day at T@@ ach@@ i@@ ban@@ a High School , the girls begin to gi@@ ggle : The German girl is totally `@@ ka@@ wai@@ i &apos; !
What this means ?
Sy@@ lv@@ ana is familiar with the term from reading man@@ ga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan .
`@@ First day at school in Japan .
I was so exc@@ ited .
The way to school alone gave me the j@@ it@@ ters .
I live at the edge of Tokyo , towards Ka@@ was@@ aki , and the train ride to T@@ ach@@ i@@ ban@@ a High School is 40 minutes .
I had to find the way on my own , and lu@@ ck@@ ily I didn &apos;t get lost .
The beginning of class isn &apos;t organized as strictly as back home in Lower Sax@@ ony .
Stu@@ dents begin tri@@ ck@@ ling in at eight o &apos;@@ clock , until a brief conference with the teacher , the `@@ home room , &apos; starts at 8 : 40 .
But before class began , it was my turn to introduce myself .
I &apos;m not someone who likes to talk in front of other people , mind you , let alone a class of 40 .
Because I didn &apos;t have a school uniform yet , I was dres@@ sed in one of my host mother &apos;s old sk@@ ir@@ ts , as well as a bl@@ ouse , blue stock@@ ings and black leather shoes .
In this atti@@ re , I stood before the desk and tried to pron@@ ounce everything correctly : &apos; Sa@@ y@@ on@@ ara Wo she Sy@@ lv@@ ana ... &apos; - my name is Sy@@ lv@@ ana , I &apos;m from Germany and my birthday is a week from now .
At that moment , I was very glad that I &apos;d been learning the language for two years already .
The 31 girls in class were all wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing and gi@@ ggling among themselves and wa@@ ving at me , and I kept hearing the word `@@ ka@@ wai@@ i . &apos; 
I already knew it from my man@@ ga .
It &apos;s part of the essential voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary of Japanese girls and means `@@ cu@@ te , &apos; `@@ sweet . &apos; 
Then I sc@@ ur@@ ried to my seat .
The girl beside me was sm@@ iling rather brigh@@ tly . She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be se@@ ated next to her .
The rest of class was pretty un@@ event@@ ful , but when the bell rang , they were all practically crow@@ ding me .
They were talking all at once and gi@@ gg@@ led and bom@@ bar@@ ded me with one question after another , even though Japanese English is really hard to understand .
Then , during the break , everybody got out their b@@ ent@@ os .
My host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me , too - it &apos;s something else than the ble@@ ak German lunch break sand@@ wi@@ ches .
I had rice with her@@ bs , little s@@ aus@@ ages , sal@@ ad made from cu@@ cum@@ ber and al@@ ga@@ e , fruit and some kind of meat in a to@@ fu coat .
Most of the time I don &apos;t have the first clu@@ e what I &apos;m eating here in Japan .
The stuff looks wei@@ rd and has a completely novel taste .
I can say this : It &apos;s all delicious .
Well , except for the sal@@ ty pl@@ ums in oil , that is . Y@@ euch !
At Japanese schools , the b@@ ent@@ os aren &apos;t just lunch .
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a hom@@ em@@ ade ben@@ to that she &apos;s fixed in a particularly fan@@ cy way to a boy , in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break .
I read about that in my man@@ ga .
I &apos;m looking forward to finding out whether that &apos;s happening here , too .
`@@ Why Japan , of all places ? , &apos; my gir@@ l@@ friends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year .
And I always told them :
`@@ Because it happens to fascin@@ ate me . &apos; 
After all , man@@ ga have been my favorite reading material for years .
And in order to have a better understanding of the com@@ ics and the culture in them , I eventually started to learn a little Japanese , as well .
So for me it &apos;s been a no-@@ bra@@ iner that I would have to come here eventually .
Because I also have a pen@@ chant for tradition , man@@ ners and customs .
And those are considered very important here .
On the one hand , Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends , but on the other hand it is strict , discipl@@ ined and traditional .
And because everything is so well-@@ organized , I haven &apos;t felt lost yet , even though Tokyo is the biggest city I &apos;ve ever seen .
Rats Have Fe@@ elings , Too
When in danger , a rat or ro@@ ach will run away . Does it mean they experience fear , too ?
Neu@@ ro@@ scienti@@ st Joseph Le@@ Dou@@ x is convinced that many animals have feelings , as well .
But if they act the same way we do , how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings ?
The Internet magazine `@@ E@@ dge &apos; has been running pieces by famous scientists for years .
In a series , SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL ON@@ LIN@@ E presents a selection of responses to the question , `@@ What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it ? &apos;
I believe that animals have feelings , as well as other modes of awareness , although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date . For that matter , we haven &apos;t even been able to prove that other people possess awareness .
But in that case , we can at least hope , since all human bra@@ ins possess the same basic configuration .
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general , however , we are entering difficult terrain , because the hardware is not compatible .
When a rat is in danger , it does the same thing as many other animals : It plays pos@@ sum , runs away or attacks .
Hum@@ ans be@@ have simil@@ arly , which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjec@@ tive experience is comparable .
But I don &apos;t believe that .
There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjec@@ tive experience onto animals .
For one thing , those circu@@ its almost always involved in human awareness include the lateral pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex ( due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions ) .
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other prim@@ ates , and it seems to be entirely missing in other creatures .
So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other prim@@ ates .
Another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man &apos;s linguistic nature : Because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language , it &apos;s often said that their awareness depends on it .
In that case , animals could be excluded .
But even if awareness was not dependent on language , it would certainly be affected by it , meaning that animal awareness , however it may be defined , would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness .
That &apos;s why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be like .
If you have something that , being internal and subjec@@ tive , can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analy@@ zed according to our own experience , then its study comes with significant challenges .
My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness , but aside from that , there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scienti@@ fic@@ ally .
Anim@@ al awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content , and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in the study of the short-term memory of prim@@ ates , particularly when it comes to the example of visu@@ alization .
But this approach , which was followed by Christ@@ of Ko@@ ch and Franc@@ is Cri@@ ck , is concerned with the neu@@ ral cor@@ relates of awareness rather than the caus@@ al mechanisms , which may or may not be identical .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , this approach also emphasi@@ zes the significance of the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex for the generation of the visu@@ alization .
What does this mean for feelings , now ?
Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is trig@@ gered in a brain that &apos;s aware of its own activity .
What we call `@@ fear , &apos; consequently , is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain ( or its effects , such as physical reactions ) is using virtual memory .
From that perspective , feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cor@@ tex which are unique to prim@@ ates , and humans in particular .
In conjunction with the linguistic nature , the result are delicate emotional sha@@ des , because through words and gram@@ mar we can differenti@@ ate between states and categ@@ ori@@ ze them , in order to project them onto others as well .
In contrast to this , Antonio Dam@@ asi@@ o sup@@ poses , for instance , that feelings result from more primi@@ tive activities in the areas of the cor@@ text and the bra@@ inst@@ em concerned with bo@@ di@@ ly sens@@ ations . Ja@@ ak Pan@@ k@@ se@@ ep says something similar , but his focus is more on the bra@@ inst@@ em .
Since this network ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t changed in the course of human evolution , they say , it might well be a cause of cross-@@ species sens@@ ations .
In theory , I can &apos;t disagree with that , but I consider it impro@@ vable .
Pan@@ k@@ se@@ ep argu@@ es that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it , as well , in both cases . But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways ?
A ro@@ ach &apos;s response to danger is flight . Does it experience fear ?
As far as I &apos;m concerned , a mere simil@@ arity of actions is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences .
The neu@@ ral comparison is helpful , granted : Rats and humans have similar bra@@ inst@@ ems , whereas ro@@ aches do not even have bra@@ ins .
But is the bra@@ inst@@ em responsible for emotions ?
And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats ?
I believe rats and other m@@ amm@@ als - maybe even ro@@ aches ( who knows ? ) - have emotions .
But I w@@ ouldn &apos;t know how to prove it .
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours ( since human awareness is based on specific circu@@ its and on language ) , I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sens@@ ations of rats .
There is the promise of results on the neu@@ ral level here , in any case , provided the same can be measured in rats and humans .
Just like I don &apos;t study language and awareness in rats , neither do I study their emotions , given that I don &apos;t even know if they exist .
One may consider that to be short-@@ si@@ ghted , but I prefer to make progress , rather than to keep hit@@ ting a wall .
I just happen to be a practical emotion@@ alist .
U@@ EFA President Plat@@ ini : Re@@ pri@@ eve for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister I@@ van V@@ asy@@ uni@@ k said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister .
`@@ The government considers U@@ EFA &apos;s decision a display of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the Euro@@ cup together with Poland , &apos; V@@ asy@@ uni@@ k said .
`@@ This is no am@@ nesty for our country .
Work has only just begun , and there is much still to be done in both countries . &apos; 
The two hosts are behind on the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of sta@@ di@@ ums , roads , hotels and airports .
Even a reduction of the number of Euro sta@@ di@@ ums from eight to six is possible .
`@@ We cannot waste any more time .
We have to proceed at great speed now , &apos; said Gri@@ gori@@ y Sur@@ kis , president of the Ukrainian so@@ ccer association .
`@@ U@@ EFA will be keeping an eye on us constantly . &apos; 
An even more radical measure was taken in Poland .
After numerous scand@@ als , the leadership of the Polish association P@@ Z@@ P@@ N was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Z@@ aw@@ lock@@ i .
The commission had been assembled at the request of Minister of Sport Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Dr@@ ze@@ vi@@ eck@@ i .
There was `@@ the serious danger that the P@@ Z@@ P@@ N is not able to act according to the rules , &apos; Dr@@ ze@@ vi@@ eck@@ i told Polish news agency P@@ AP .
`@@ We have reas@@ su@@ red U@@ EFA President Michel Plat@@ ini in a letter that preparations for the Euro 2012 will not suffer because of this . &apos;

Indi@@ gn@@ ant D@@ enn@@ is Qu@@ aid Stri@@ kes Back
She wanted to promote a new film , talked about personal matters in an interview - and now she &apos;s in trouble with her ex : Hollywood star Me@@ g Ry@@ an called her former husband D@@ enn@@ is Qu@@ aid an adul@@ terer .

F@@ light and Hotel Rates Dro@@ p
In the first half-@@ year of 2008 , flights and rooms in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year .
In Germany , flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent , a current survey says .
Rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again , according to a survey by travel and financial services provider American Express .
Analy@@ zing its booking data from the first half-@@ year of 2008 , the company found that , after an increase of rates in the first quarter , there was a significant drop in the second quarter .
Following years of increasing rates in the hotel market , rooms have already become cheaper in many places .
From January to March , rates in 41 out of 48 analy@@ zed European cities were still increasing by an average 6.@@ 9 percent compared to 2007 .
But from April to June , rates had already dropped by 3.@@ 6 percent ver@@ sus the previous year .
The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome , the survey says , where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago .
American Express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this , as it results in a `@@ decre@@ asing desire for travel among American tourists . &apos; 
Financial centers like Frankfurt and London were hit harder by the drop@@ ping hotel rates than industry locations such as Hannover , Cologne or St@@ av@@ anger , it further says .
With an increase of 2@@ 6.@@ 3 percent , hotel rates in the Norwe@@ gian city are holding the record for Europe , even .
F@@ light rates were also still tr@@ ending up in the first quarter .
Due to the increasing cost of ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e , econom@@ y-@@ class travelers had to pay 7.@@ 1 percent more on average than in 2007 , while rates for more fu@@ el-@@ intensive long-@@ range flights even went up by as much as 2@@ 9.@@ 2 percent .
From April to June , econom@@ y-@@ class flight rates dropped by an average 12.@@ 5 percent ver@@ sus the prec@@ eding quarter , whereas business@@ - and first-class price changes were much less notic@@ eable .
In Germany , rates dropped even more shar@@ ply than in other European countries .
From January to March , rates had increased by 11.@@ 9 percent , in the second quarter they dropped by 23.@@ 6 percent .
The rates of domestic German flights were hal@@ ved even , a survey says .
On the one hand , the sudden drop in rates was the result of the s@@ lowing economic growth , the company says .
Dem@@ and was rec@@ eding in many segments of the air-@@ travel market , it says .
On the other hand , there was an increase in competitive pressure through the Open Sk@@ ies Agreement , which dereg@@ ul@@ ates air travel between the U.S. and Europe .
Among the signs of increasing tension were the can@@ cel@@ ation of un@@ profitable routes at airlines , it says , as well as the high number of airlines fil@@ ing for bank@@ rupt@@ cy in the first half-@@ year of 2008 - in Europe alone , it was 24 airlines , it says .

Later , the Do@@ w Jones somewhat rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated again .
Around 8 : 30 PM the world &apos;s most significant market indicator listed with 10@@ ,@@ 5@@ 79 points , with a min@@ us of more than five percent .
The technology stock exchange Nas@@ da@@ q was at 15@@ 48 points , with a min@@ us of more than seven percent .
In the Do@@ w , the biggest losses were suffered by American Express at this stage , which dropped by 14 percent , as well as by the Bank of America , which lost around twelve percent .
There were no increases for any shares .
Sha@@ res of the bank Gold@@ man Sach@@ s dec@@ lined by approximately ten percent .

Dar@@ k Mat@@ ter Aff@@ ects F@@ light of Space Pro@@ bes
For years , a mysteri@@ ous phenomenon has had researchers st@@ ump@@ ed : Dar@@ k matter is affecting the speed of space prob@@ es during so-called sw@@ ing-@@ by man@@ eu@@ vers .
Exper@@ ts fear that Albert Ein@@ stein &apos;s general theory of rel@@ ativity may not be entirely correct .
For almost 18 years , the probe `@@ U@@ ly@@ sses &apos; has been flying through space .
Due to free@@ zing fuel lines , it is now threatening to shut down .
Among scientists , a mysteri@@ ous phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Sw@@ ing@@ -B@@ y An@@ om@@ al@@ y .
The sw@@ ing-@@ by is a flight man@@ eu@@ ver during which space prob@@ es gain additional acceler@@ ation in the gra@@ vit@@ ational field of a cel@@ esti@@ al body , such as Earth .
It enables the prob@@ es to save a lot of fuel .
The Europe@@ an-@@ American research probe C@@ ass@@ ini@@ -@@ Hu@@ y@@ gens made use of this physical tri@@ ck , as did the solar probe U@@ ly@@ sses .
But what resear@@ ches have been wonder@@ ing about for years is this : The objects in flight are not be@@ having precisely in the way we have come to expect according to the ven@@ er@@ able law of grav@@ itation .
Rather , there are irregularities in their speed .
The prob@@ es un@@ expec@@ tedly become faster or s@@ lower .
To date , physi@@ ci@@ sts have been unable to explain this effect .
They have du@@ b@@ bed it the Sw@@ ing@@ -B@@ y An@@ om@@ al@@ y .
Some experts fear that even Albert Ein@@ stein &apos;s general theory of rel@@ ativity , which describes the gra@@ vit@@ ational pull of matter through a cur@@ v@@ ature of space , may not be entirely correct .
The American physi@@ c@@ ist Stephen Ad@@ ler at the Institute for Advanced Stu@@ dy in Princ@@ et@@ on still firmly believes that Ein@@ stein did not er@@ r , and is trying to explain the Sw@@ ing@@ -B@@ y An@@ om@@ al@@ y by way of the so-called dark matter that astronom@@ ers discovered in the universe .
`@@ It could be dark matter existing very close to Earth that may be responsible for the an@@ om@@ al@@ y , &apos; he writes .
Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years .
E@@ vi@@ dently , it em@@ its a gra@@ vit@@ ational force whose effect on other cel@@ esti@@ al bodies is meas@@ u@@ rable .
The dark matter itself is completely in@@ visible , however , meaning that it neither sends nor em@@ its any electro@@ magnetic radiation whatsoever , such as , consequently , visible light in particular .
According to the scientists &apos; calculations , dark matter constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe .
Ab@@ duc@@ ted Tou@@ rists in Egypt Rele@@ ased
After being held ho@@ stage by their cap@@ tors for ten days , the tourists ab@@ duc@@ ted in Egypt have evi@@ dently been released , as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister .
The ab@@ duc@@ tors from Sudan had demanded a ran@@ som of several million Euros .
In a sho@@ ot-@@ out prec@@ eding the rescue , six of their cap@@ tors were re@@ porte@@ dly killed .
In the south of Egypt , five Germans have been ab@@ duc@@ ted .
Ne@@ goti@@ ations concerning a ran@@ som are re@@ porte@@ dly already under@@ way .
Time and again , Germans end up in the cross@@ ha@@ irs of ki@@ dn@@ ap@@ pers .
`@@ Welt Online &apos; reports the most notable cases .
The European tourists ab@@ duc@@ ted in the Sahara have apparently been fre@@ ed .
Re@@ ports by Egyptian state television , the Ara@@ bian TV channel al-@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya and Italian media are in accordance on that .
According to Italian TV channel Sky T@@ G 24 , Italian Foreign Minister Fran@@ co Frattini confirmed the release : `@@ Our fellow citizens and the other host@@ ages have been fre@@ ed .
Right now we are checking their health , &apos; Frattini said .
The five Germans , five Itali@@ ans , one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian compan@@ ions were safe and sound , Egyptian state television reported .
The 19 participants of a desert ex@@ pedition were already on their way to Cairo , it said .
The circumstances of the sho@@ ot-@@ out prec@@ eding the release remain unclear : According to an Egyptian security agent , the cap@@ tors were ready to end the ab@@ duction when the Su@@ dan@@ ese army suddenly killed six of the ab@@ duc@@ tors .
`@@ The problem had been solved .
They had agreed to a ran@@ som , &apos; the agent said .
It had been `@@ only a matter of receiving the host@@ ages , &apos; when suddenly `@@ this surprise &apos; happened .
On Sunday , Su@@ dan@@ ese soldiers had shot dead six of the ab@@ duc@@ tors and taken two as prisoners in the border region between Sudan , C@@ had and Egypt .
The ab@@ duc@@ tors had demanded a ran@@ som of six million Euros from Germany ; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the host@@ ages .
C@@ iting a German negoti@@ ator , the daily newspaper `@@ El Mas@@ ri El J@@ om &apos; reported that the release was being delayed because the ki@@ dn@@ ap@@ pers were f@@ ear@@ ing for their safety .
According to the report , the ab@@ duc@@ tors intended to release the female host@@ ages once the ran@@ som had been paid .
The men were to be held cap@@ tive until the ab@@ duc@@ tors would have secured an escape route .
The German emb@@ assy in Cairo dec@@ lined to comment on the report .
Ste@@ p@@ father abuse &quot; led to suicide &quot;
Y@@ ears of abuse by her step@@ father led a woman to kill herself , a court has been told .
Michael Tr@@ er@@ ise , 57 , of Sti@@ thi@@ ans , Corn@@ wall , was j@@ ailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of inde@@ cent ass@@ ault .
Tr@@ uro Cro@@ wn Court heard he regularly tied up his step@@ -@@ daughter Steph@@ an@@ ie Rand@@ le , when she was aged between five and seven .
Tr@@ er@@ ise wrote in a conf@@ ession note : &quot; I feel responsible for her death . &quot;
The court heard that Ms Rand@@ le killed herself at her home in Mut@@ ley , P@@ ly@@ mouth , on 1 April 2007 , aged 34 .
When she was a child living in Co@@ vent@@ ry , Tr@@ er@@ ise had tied her up and blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded her before performing sexual acts , while her mother was out working at a pu@@ b .
Tr@@ er@@ ise and his wife di@@ vor@@ ced in the 1980s , and he returned to live in Corn@@ wall .
His step@@ -@@ daughter went to P@@ ly@@ mouth .
But the court heard that Ms Rand@@ le , who spent much of her time volunte@@ ering for the National Tr@@ ust , was ha@@ un@@ ted by the abuse which had been inf@@ lic@@ ted on her twi@@ ce-@@ weekly .
By 2006 , prosec@@ utor Ram@@ sey Qu@@ ai@@ fe told the court , friends said Ms Rand@@ le , who had been a keen sur@@ fer and cy@@ cli@@ st , was &quot; emo@@ tionally dead &quot; , and had &quot; given up on life &quot; .
In April 2007 her real father , Ter@@ ran@@ ce Rand@@ le , found her dead at her flat in P@@ ly@@ mouth .
She is thought to have killed herself through suff@@ oc@@ ation using a plastic bag .
Mr Rand@@ le confronted his daughter &apos;s step@@ -@@ father , who wrote a conf@@ ession letter which ended : &quot; I used to tie her up and blin@@ d@@ fold her .
&quot; I didn &apos;t sex@@ ually ass@@ ault her .
I feel responsible for her death . &quot;
Ju@@ dge Christop@@ her El@@ wen told Tr@@ er@@ ise : &quot; You are an extremely strange fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ist , and for your victim it must have been terri@@ fying , especially when she was only seven .
&quot; This un@@ pleasant sag@@ a ends with the victim taking her own life .
Even more stark , is the fact that had she not done so , it &apos;s very doub@@ tful that matters would have ended up in court . &quot;
He added : &quot; I note the effect Steph@@ an@@ ie &apos;s father and mother describe your crime having on their daughter over the years .
&quot; She was pla@@ in@@ ly otherwise likely to have been a promising , successful and happy young woman . &quot;
Lo@@ st data official to be charged
The Cab@@ inet Office official who left top-@@ secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secre@@ ts Act , the BBC has learned .
The man was on secon@@ d@@ ment from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Water@@ lo@@ o .
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police .
It is the least sensitive charge under the act and there is no suggestion of criminal intent .
BBC defence correspon@@ dent Frank Gar@@ dner said the move would have come as a surprise to many in Whit@@ eh@@ all .
&quot; They will have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mo@@ D and Cab@@ inet Office , &quot; he said .
The employee , who cannot be named , is being charged under section 8.@@ 1 of the act , the clause which deals with safeguarding information .
The Cro@@ wn Pro@@ sec@@ ution Service recommended the official should be charged by the Metro@@ politan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intel@@ ligence Committee .
The documents he mis@@ placed contained classified assessments about al-@@ Q@@ ae@@ da and the capabilities of Iraq &apos;s security forces .
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an un@@ dis@@ closed location .
Building societies face B &amp; B bill
Britain &apos;s building societies could face a bill of more than £ 80@@ m after the rescue of the Bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; B@@ ing@@ ley bank .
The Government provided £ 14@@ bn to protect the deposits of Bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; B@@ ing@@ ley &apos;s 2.@@ 6 million sa@@ vers .
The interest on that loan will be paid by all firms that take sa@@ vers &apos; money , including the 59 building societies .
The director general of the Building Soci@@ e@@ ties Association ( BS@@ A ) Adri@@ an Col@@ es said it was &quot; g@@ alling &quot; that societies and their members had to pay .
The £ 14@@ bn loan will eventually be re@@ paid as Bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; B@@ ing@@ ley &apos;s mort@@ g@@ ages are re@@ deemed .
But the interest which will acc@@ rue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits .
The Financial Services Comp@@ ens@@ ation Sch@@ eme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies would be included in that number .
It is g@@ alling that those institutions that beha@@ ved pru@@ dently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the b@@ ills of those institutions that were far less pru@@ dent
Adri@@ an Col@@ es , BS@@ A
It said each firm had to pay in proportion to the deposits it held , and that the societies between them had to pay about 18 % of the cost .
The Treas@@ ury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £ 4@@ 50@@ m in 2009 .
That means the societies will have to find £ 8@@ 1@@ m to pay the first year &apos;s interest .
Adri@@ an Col@@ es , director general of the building societies &apos; trade association , told the BBC he believes that is unfair .
&quot; It is g@@ alling that those institutions that beha@@ ved pru@@ dently in the housing market up@@ s@@ wing are now being called upon to pay some of the b@@ ills of those institutions that were far less pru@@ dent . &quot;
According to the BS@@ A , no society has failed since its records began in 1945 .
&quot; We will need to examine all the aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill , &quot; added Mr C@@ ole .
The interest due in 2009 cover seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March .
In 2010 a full year &apos;s interest will be due and that could be almost twice as much .
Since building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders , their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates on saving accounts .
Mil@@ k to go up five p@@ ence a li@@ tre
People in Jer@@ sey are facing having to pay more for their milk .
Jer@@ sey D@@ air@@ y has announced that it will increase the wholes@@ ale price of its milk by an extra five p@@ ence a li@@ tre from Monday .
It is the second price increase this year , following a two p@@ ence rise in February , and comes after research carried out by a consultancy company .
Ret@@ ail@@ ers are to decide for themselves if they want pass on the price increases to their customers .
Before the February increase , the wholes@@ ale price of Jer@@ sey milk last changed in 2002 .
Banglades@@ h ex-@@ PM is denied ba@@ il
A Banglades@@ h court has rejected a ba@@ il ple@@ a of former PM S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina , meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country .
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her ba@@ il over charges of ex@@ tor@@ ting 50 million ta@@ ka ( $ 7@@ 29@@ ,@@ 700 ) from a business@@ man when she was PM .
The case is one of several corruption charges pending against her .
S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina &apos;s long-@@ time political ri@@ val , K@@ hal@@ e@@ da Z@@ ia , was released on ba@@ il earlier this month .
S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina is due to return to Banglades@@ h over the next few weeks but her party , the A@@ w@@ ami League , has demanded that the country &apos;s milit@@ ar@@ y-@@ backed care@@ ta@@ ker government should first give her full freedom .
Cor@@ respon@@ dents say that while she was given par@@ ole to go abroad for medical treatment , it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Banglades@@ h .
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court order .
&quot; The High Court rejected S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina &apos;s ba@@ il petition saying that she doesn &apos;t have to get ba@@ il as she &apos;s already under@@ going treatment abroad on par@@ ole , &quot; her barri@@ ster Ra@@ fi@@ qu@@ e-@@ ul Hu@@ q said .
&quot; We &apos;ll file an appeal against the High Court order . &quot;
Her lawyers argued that she needed ba@@ il to come back to the country from abroad to prepare for elections in December .
S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina is expected to return home after 17 October , a senior A@@ w@@ ami League party leader said on Sunday .
She was de@@ tained last year after the arm@@ y-@@ backed interim government assumed power , but was released from prison in June , to go abroad for medical treatment .
Both S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina and K@@ hal@@ e@@ da Z@@ ia deny all charges against them .
F@@ ears for Afghan anti-@@ poli@@ o drive
Almost 200@@ ,000 children in Afghanistan missed out on a recent poli@@ o imm@@ un@@ isation drive because of violence linked to the Tal@@ eb@@ an , the UN says .
The UN carried out a vacc@@ ination programme in six provin@@ ces last week .
But it says it could not reach children in parts of Hel@@ m@@ and and Kan@@ da@@ h@@ ar in the south for security reasons .
A UN spo@@ kes@@ man said this was despite ple@@ dges from the Tal@@ eb@@ an that they would not attack or ob@@ struc@@ t thousands of staff carrying out the vacc@@ inations .
B@@ Sky@@ B loses I@@ TV legal challenge
B@@ Sky@@ B has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission &apos;s decision forcing the firm to reduce its stake in ri@@ val broad@@ cast@@ er I@@ TV .
B@@ Sky@@ B has been told by the Competition Ap@@ pe@@ al Tri@@ bunal to cut its holding in I@@ TV from 17.@@ 9 % to below 7.@@ 5 % .
Pre@@ viously , the commission said that B@@ Sky@@ B &apos;s stake th@@ war@@ ted competition and allowed it unfair influence over I@@ TV .
B@@ Sky@@ B bought the stake in 2006 in a deal which effectively blocked NT@@ L , now ren@@ amed Virgin Media , from buying I@@ TV .
In April 2007 , the Office of Fair Trading reported that B@@ Sky@@ B &apos;s acquisition of its stake in I@@ TV shed doubt on the independence of I@@ TV , promp@@ ting the Competition Commission to launch a probe .
Virgin bo@@ ss Sir Richard Bran@@ son , consumer groups and the regul@@ ator O@@ f@@ com all opposed the purchase .
B@@ Sky@@ B argued that forcing it to reduce its I@@ TV stake was un@@ reasonable and a dis@@ proportionate remedy - particularly as B@@ Sky@@ B had said it would sur@@ render its voting rights .
New probe into US att@@ or@@ ney affair
The US att@@ or@@ ney general has appointed a special prosec@@ utor to look into the fir@@ ing of nine US att@@ or@@ neys in 2006 .
The move came as a report into the affair by the inspec@@ tor general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials .
The report was critical of White House officials , law@@ makers and the former Att@@ or@@ ney General Alber@@ to Gonz@@ ales .
The investigation was promp@@ ted by fears that the att@@ or@@ neys had been removed for political reasons .
Special Pro@@ sec@@ utor Nor@@ a D@@ ann@@ eh@@ y will now investigate whether officials ques@@ tioned during the probe lied to investig@@ ators in an attempt to ob@@ struc@@ t justice .
&quot; Seri@@ ous alleg@@ ations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved , &quot; In@@ spec@@ tor General Gl@@ enn Fine said in his report .
The appointment of a special prosec@@ utor with the power to force witn@@ esses to t@@ esti@@ fy was one of his key recommendations .
The row began when nine US att@@ or@@ neys were removed from their positions by the US Department of Justice in December 2006 .
At the time , the department said that the att@@ or@@ neys had been fi@@ red for poor performance .
But it later emerged that the fi@@ red att@@ or@@ neys had not been rated any more poor@@ ly than many of their colleagues , leading many observers to conclude that the s@@ ack@@ ings had been poli@@ tic@@ ally-@@ motivated .
Some of the att@@ or@@ neys had been involved in the prosec@@ ution of high-@@ profile Republi@@ can members of Congress , while others had refused to investigate alleg@@ ations of vot@@ er fraud against Democrats .
US att@@ or@@ neys investigate and prosec@@ ute court cases for the government .
They can be dis@@ missed at any time , but may not be removed for political reasons .
The then head of the justice department , Att@@ or@@ ney General Alber@@ to Gonz@@ ales , came under fire for the s@@ ack@@ ings , and eventually re@@ signed his position .
A number of other justice department officials also re@@ signed .
The inspec@@ tor general &apos;s report was highly critical of Mr Gonz@@ ales &apos;s role in the affair , saying he b@@ ore &quot; primary responsibility &quot; for the s@@ ack@@ ings , that he &quot; ab@@ dic@@ ated &quot; his leadership role and was &quot; remark@@ ably un@@ engaged &quot; in the process .
Other officials , including former senior Bush ai@@ de Karl Ro@@ ve , were criticised for failing to co-@@ operate with the investigation .
Me@@ at Lo@@ af &apos;s ep@@ ic to be hon@@ oured
Rock star Me@@ at Lo@@ af is to be hon@@ oured at the Q Awards for his ep@@ ic an@@ them B@@ at Out Of H@@ ell .
The singer , who will collect his special golden award at next week &apos;s ceremony in London , said he was &quot; hon@@ oured &quot; to gain recognition .
The song , which la@@ sts nine minutes and fif@@ ty seconds , was the title track to Me@@ at Lo@@ af &apos;s hit 1977 album .
Col@@ d@@ play are leading the nom@@ inations for this year &apos;s awards , making the short@@ lists of four categories .
Paul Re@@ es , Q magazine &apos;s edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief , said : &quot; There are some songs that tran@@ sc@@ end such things as time and gen@@ re , and B@@ at Out Of H@@ ell is assu@@ re@@ dly one of them . &quot;
The song , p@@ enn@@ ed by J@@ im Stein@@ man , required a huge vocal which was delivered by Me@@ at Lo@@ af .
It opened with an instru@@ mental section which la@@ sted almost two minutes .
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and pe@@ aked at number 15 .
But Me@@ at Lo@@ af &apos;s B@@ at Out Of H@@ ell album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide .
Me@@ at Lo@@ af - real name Mar@@ vin Lee A@@ day - has suffered health problems in recent years , including surgery for an ir@@ regular hear@@ t@@ beat in 2003 after collap@@ sing on stage .
In 2007 , acute lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis forced him to cancel concerts .
It later emerged that he had a cy@@ st on his vocal ch@@ ord .
Ob@@ sc@@ ure City Street , Often For@@ gotten and Perhaps So@@ on for S@@ ale
New York City has thousands of aven@@ ues , bou@@ lev@@ ards , streets and other by@@ ways , some famous , others merely utili@@ t@@ arian .
But even many veter@@ an taxi drivers and long@@ time local residents find it difficult to give the location of Ex@@ tra Place , mostly because they have never heard of it .
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bo@@ wer@@ y and Second Avenue .
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long , it res@@ embles a du@@ sty alle@@ y@@ way more than an active thorou@@ gh@@ fare .
There are no street signs .
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard at@@ las .
The street does , however , have ad@@ mir@@ ers .
For instance , there is A@@ val@@ on Bay , the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street .
It wants to repa@@ ve Ex@@ tra Place and create a clean@@ er pas@@ sage@@ way to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings .
Other ad@@ mir@@ ers include long@@ time neighb@@ ors who said they were char@@ med by the trun@@ c@@ ated lane simply because it was one of the last rem@@ n@@ ants of the block &apos;s pre@@ gent@@ ri@@ fied past .
But the city &apos;s Department of H@@ ous@@ ing Pre@@ servation and Development , which has control of the street , has no interest in holding on to it .
At a meeting of the neighborhood community board &apos;s land use committee this month , representatives of the city agency and A@@ val@@ on Bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street .
But the committee pre@@ fers that the street remain in the city &apos;s hands , and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month , said Sus@@ an Ste@@ tz@@ er , the district manager of Community Board 3 .
&quot; There &apos;s very little cit@@ y-@@ owned space left , and we would like the city to continue to own Ex@@ tra Place , &quot; she said .
&quot; There could be proposals to fix it up and manage it , which could be done by A@@ val@@ on , but we also want to guarantee public access . &quot;
A@@ val@@ on Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repa@@ ve the little street and install seats , including some to be used by a caf@@ e to which the developer expects to lease space .
The idea that A@@ val@@ on Bay might buy the street was first made public at this month &apos;s meeting .
Mich@@ ele de Mil@@ ly , a spo@@ kes@@ woman for A@@ val@@ on Bay , said that though the company wanted to use the street , it did not necessarily want to own it .
&quot; A@@ val@@ on Bay &apos;s principal concern is refurb@@ ishing this der@@ e@@ lic@@ t alle@@ y@@ way and turning it into a public amen@@ ity , &quot; she said , adding that the city had suggested the sale .
S@@ eth Don@@ lin , a spo@@ kes@@ man for H@@ ous@@ ing Pre@@ servation , said it was indeed the city &apos;s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency &apos;s mission was to develop property rather than manage it .
Comp@@ ared with its more color@@ ful neighb@@ or , the Bo@@ wer@@ y , Ex@@ tra Place has left a light historical foot@@ print .
Some believe it got its name in 18@@ 02 , when a large farm owned by Phili@@ p Min@@ thor@@ ne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was un@@ claimed .
The back door of C@@ B@@ GB , the pun@@ k rock monument that closed in 2006 , opened onto Ex@@ tra Place , and the street is perhaps best known as the setting for the cover photogra@@ ph of the Ram@@ ones &apos; album &quot; Ro@@ cket to Russia . &quot;
&quot; The ground was magnificent , &quot; said D@@ ann@@ y Fiel@@ ds , the manager of the Ram@@ ones , who took the photogra@@ ph in November 1976 .
&quot; It was filled with jun@@ k , sh@@ reds of clothes and pieces of bar@@ rel@@ s , post@@ ers , leaves , rop@@ es . &quot;
Some residents , including blo@@ g@@ gers who write about the gent@@ ri@@ fication of the East Village , have opposed the idea of selling Ex@@ tra Place , argu@@ ing that the piece of public property , modest as it is , should remain public .
Others have lau@@ ded Ex@@ tra Place as a r@@ arity - a virtually un@@ changed sli@@ ver of the city that ought to be left alone .
Jer@@ em@@ i@@ ah Mo@@ ss , who runs a blog called Jer@@ em@@ i@@ ah &apos;s Van@@ ishing New York ( sub@@ ti@@ tled , &quot; The Book of L@@ ament@@ ations : A Bit@@ terly No@@ stal@@ gic Look at a City in the Process of Go@@ ing Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t &quot; ) , posted part of a Tal@@ k of the Town story about Ex@@ tra Place that appeared in The New Yor@@ ker in 195@@ 2 .
The author , Br@@ end@@ an G@@ ill , wrote : &quot; Ex@@ tra Place is a narrow little dead@@ -@@ end street , dark even by day and marked off by ru@@ sty iron ware@@ house doors and sh@@ ut@@ tered windows , with week@@ -@@ old newspapers b@@ lowing along the gut@@ ters . &quot;
With a few exceptions , the street looked much the same on a recent evening .
A rat sk@@ it@@ tered across the back of the street near a door that used to lead into C@@ B@@ GB , which is now the site of an up@@ scale clothing store .
Gra@@ ff@@ iti was on walls and an empty 2@@ 2-@@ ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh bat@@ ch of dis@@ car@@ ded newspapers .
A few pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by said that they rarely thought about Ex@@ tra Place but suggested that it could use some spru@@ cing up .
Mr. Fiel@@ ds , for his part , said he thought that some people were under@@ estim@@ ating the appeal of the street in its current state .
&quot; The best years of my life , &quot; he said , &quot; were in places that were dark , dam@@ p and dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
The Bil@@ ing@@ ual Deb@@ ate : English Immer@@ sion
In this install@@ ment of Education Watch , Bru@@ ce Ful@@ ler and L@@ ance T. I@@ zu@@ mi discuss the candidates &apos; positions on bil@@ ing@@ ual education .
L@@ ance T. I@@ zu@@ mi , a senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy , is the co-@@ author of the book &quot; Not as Good as You Th@@ ink : Why the Middle Class Ne@@ eds School Cho@@ ice . &quot;
Making effective appe@@ als to His@@ pan@@ ic voters is a tri@@ cky business .
Barack Obama &apos;s education proposals are a case in point .
Mr. Obama &apos;s campaign notes that , &quot; Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American and Lat@@ ino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students , &quot; which is true .
To combat such achievement gaps , Mr. Obama &apos;s education plan specifically advocates , among other things , &quot; transitional bil@@ ing@@ ual education &quot; for Engli@@ sh-@@ lear@@ ners .
Yet , the question for Mr. Obama is whether his commitment to bil@@ ing@@ ual education , which emphasi@@ zes class@@ room instruction in languages other than English , over@@ ri@@ des his interest in closing achievement gaps .
Take , for example , Six@@ th Street Pre@@ p , a charter elem@@ entary school in eastern Los Angeles County .
The school &apos;s students are overwhel@@ m@@ ingly His@@ pan@@ ic and low income .
More than a third of the students , many of whom are recent arri@@ vals , are learning English .
Yet , among fourth gra@@ ders , an ast@@ o@@ und@@ ing 100 percent of the students tested at the profi@@ ci@@ ent level on the 2008 state math ex@@ am .
A nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth gra@@ ders tested profi@@ ci@@ ent on the state Engli@@ sh-@@ langu@@ age-@@ arts ex@@ am .
This incredible success was achieved using a different ing@@ re@@ dient than the one fa@@ vo@@ red by Mr. Obama .
Six@@ th Street emphasi@@ zes review and practice , constant assessment of skills and a no-@@ exc@@ uses attitude .
Furthermore , and here &apos;s where Mr. Obama should take note , according to Lin@@ da Mik@@ els , Six@@ th Street &apos;s principal , the school &apos;s instruc@@ tional approach for English lear@@ ners is &quot; full immer@@ sion . &quot;
English immer@@ sion emphasi@@ zes the near@@ -@@ exclusive use of English in content instruction .
M@@ s. Mik@@ els , who op@@ poses bil@@ ing@@ ual education , told me , &quot; we &apos;ve had tremendous success with having a student who is brand new from Mexico and you would walk into a class@@ room 12 months later and you w@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to pick out which one he was . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s working , &quot; she observed , &quot; it &apos;s working for us . &quot;
Would Mr. Obama hold up a school like Six@@ th Street Pre@@ p as one model for rep@@ lic@@ ation by other schools with large His@@ pan@@ ic and Engli@@ sh-@@ lear@@ ner populations ?
The school &apos;s achievement results should make the answer to that question a no-@@ bra@@ iner , but the education politics within his own party ( the National Education Associ@@ ations has been a long-@@ time suppor@@ ter of bil@@ ing@@ ual education ) and his own consistent support for bil@@ ing@@ ual education ob@@ sc@@ ure predic@@ ting Mr. Obama &apos;s response .
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English , Mr. Obama recently tri@@ vi@@ alized the issue when he said that people should stop worrying about &quot; Engli@@ sh-@@ only &quot; legislation .
Instead , he said , &quot; you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish . &quot;
If Mr. Obama truly wishes to close achievement gaps , he should carefully consider education models that work rather than sc@@ orn or tri@@ vi@@ alize them .

Oil prices dropped shar@@ ply on Monday because of concerns that even the American ba@@ il@@ out plan for the financial markets may fail to revi@@ ve the economy .
Cru@@ de oil fut@@ ures fell as much as 7 percent to $ 9@@ 9.@@ 80 a bar@@ rel on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange in morning trading .
Prices have lost more than $ 20 a bar@@ rel since last Monday .
In the last two weeks , commodity markets have been sha@@ ken by the financial tur@@ mo@@ il on Wall Street , and a pair of powerful hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es in the Gulf of Mexico .
After reaching a high of $ 14@@ 5.@@ 29 a bar@@ rel in July , prices had fallen to nearly $ 90 a bar@@ rel earlier this month , before once again j@@ umping back up on the back of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets .
An@@ xi@@ ety gri@@ pped investors once again on Monday even after Con@@ gres@@ sional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the ba@@ il@@ out plan , the largest in history .
The news was over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over .
In the latest episode of the un@@ fol@@ ding mel@@ t@@ down , C@@ iti@@ group will buy the banking operations of the Wach@@ o@@ via Corporation , the government said Monday .
Meanwhile , the Belgian , Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nation@@ alized the European financial con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate For@@ tis .
An@@ alyst@@ s at Bar@@ cla@@ ys Capital said the fran@@ tic weekend negotiations that led to the ba@@ il@@ out agreement &quot; appear to have failed to revi@@ ve market sen@@ timent . &quot;
As the economic situation deterior@@ ates , the demand for commodities , including oil , is expected to slow down .
&quot; The outlook for global equity , interest rate and exchange rate markets has become increasingly uncertain , &quot; an@@ alyst@@ s at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors .
&quot; We believe commodities will be unable to escape the con@@ ta@@ gion .
From a commodity perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the US virus sp@@ reads globally and specifically to China . &quot;
The bank &apos;s an@@ alyst@@ s p@@ ared down their expectations for next year as oil consumption drop@@ s because of s@@ lowing economic growth , reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009 .
Sec@@ on@@ d-@@ Quar@@ ter Spre@@ e S@@ ets Team Rec@@ ord
After spending more time in a J@@ ets uniform the last eigh@@ t-@@ plus seasons than anyone , defen@@ sive end S@@ hau@@ n El@@ lis thought he had seen it all .
Then he wat@@ ched the second quarter un@@ fold Sunday , when the J@@ ets transformed a sco@@ reless game into a b@@ low@@ out .
&quot; Ne@@ ver seen anything quite like that , &quot; El@@ lis said .
The second quarter began after the J@@ ets and the Ari@@ zona Car@@ din@@ als had matched the glo@@ om@@ y clou@@ ds han@@ ging over@@ head with slo@@ ppy play .
Then quar@@ ter@@ back Bre@@ tt F@@ av@@ re found La@@ veran@@ ues Col@@ es for a 12-@@ yard tou@@ ch@@ down strike , providing the perfect har@@ b@@ inger for an afternoon when their evol@@ ving connection took a giant lea@@ p forward .
F@@ av@@ re found Col@@ es for two more tou@@ ch@@ down@@ s in the quarter , including one when a cor@@ ner@@ back fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the half .
&quot; I didn &apos;t go out of my way , &quot; F@@ av@@ re said of all the passes that went to Col@@ es .
&quot; He &apos;s a hell of a player .
Our communication has been great , regardless of what people may think . &quot;
While F@@ av@@ re and Col@@ es played catch , the defense bat@@ tered Car@@ din@@ als quar@@ ter@@ back Kur@@ t War@@ ner .
Cor@@ ner@@ back Dar@@ rel@@ le Re@@ vis inter@@ cep@@ ted an er@@ rant throw and returned it 32 yards for a tou@@ ch@@ down .
Safety Eric Smith ti@@ pped another pass and inter@@ cep@@ ted it .
Lin@@ eb@@ ack@@ er David Bo@@ wen@@ s forced a f@@ um@@ ble by War@@ ner .
The last turnover , the f@@ um@@ ble forced by Bo@@ wen@@ s , might have been the most e@@ gre@@ gious .
The Car@@ din@@ als had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left , and after the J@@ ets recover@@ ed the ball , J@@ ay Fe@@ ely ki@@ cked a 20-@@ yard field goal for a 3@@ 4-@@ 0 lead .
It was the most the J@@ ets had ever sco@@ red in a quarter .
A@@ sk@@ ed to describe the cra@@ zin@@ ess of it , J@@ ets Co@@ ach Eric Man@@ gin@@ i said , &quot; The second quarter or the third quarter ? &quot;
When he was told both - the J@@ ets allowed 21 un@@ answered points in the third quarter - Man@@ gin@@ i said : &quot; I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than I did the third quarter .
There were a lot of points sco@@ red in a short amount of time . &quot;
Re@@ sted Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie T@@ ops His World Rec@@ ord
Ha@@ ile Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie of Ethiop@@ ia again showed why many consider him the greatest distance run@@ ner ever , breaking his own world record in the mar@@ athon in Berlin on Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 2@@ 6.@@ 2-@@ mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes .
With a victory on the accomm@@ o@@ dat@@ ingly flat course in 2 : 03 : 59 , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie sh@@ at@@ tered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2 : 04 : 26 , run last year in Berlin .
At 35 , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie set the 26@@ th world record of a career of such stunning bre@@ ad@@ th that he has produced a world champ@@ ionship or world record at every distance from the met@@ ric mile to the mar@@ athon .
Last month , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie ski@@ pped the Olympic mar@@ athon in Beijing , f@@ ear@@ ing - perhaps too al@@ arm@@ ingly , in retro@@ spec@@ t - that the air pollution would exacerb@@ ate his problems with as@@ th@@ ma .
Instead , he signed to run in Berlin .
In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start , 55 degrees at the finish - Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie won Sunday while aver@@ aging a bli@@ stering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile .
As track run@@ ners like Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie and Paul T@@ erg@@ at of Kenya have turned to longer distances , the record for the mar@@ athon has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade , since Ron@@ al@@ do da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2 : 06 : 05 in 1998 .
After Sunday &apos;s victory , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie told re@@ por@@ ters that he had cra@@ mp@@ s in his cal@@ f two weeks ago and had missed a week of training .
Clearly , the la@@ yo@@ ff left him fresh , not ru@@ sty .
&quot; I &apos;m so happy , &quot; Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie told re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; Everything was perfect .
I started again a week ago , and had some doubts today , but in the end everything was fine . &quot;
He has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya , Ethiop@@ ia &apos;s East African ri@@ val - for over@@ ly orchest@@ rating his races , generally avoiding many of the world &apos;s top mar@@ athon stars , rel@@ ying on pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers as if it were a track race , and placing world records ahead of a sense of competition .
But this criticism hardly dimin@@ ishes the great@@ ness of Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie &apos;s skill as a distance run@@ ner .
P@@ ac@@ ed by four Ken@@ y@@ ans on Sunday , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie reached the mid@@ way point in 1 : 02 : 04 .
Two elite Ken@@ yan run@@ ners , James K@@ w@@ am@@ ba@@ i and Charles Kam@@ ath@@ i , kept challenging Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie after the pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers f@@ aded .
A little more than three miles from the finish , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie made a final sur@@ ge to separate from K@@ w@@ am@@ ba@@ i , who finished second in 2 : 05 : 36 , improving his personal best by nearly five minutes .
Kam@@ ath@@ i took third in 2 : 07 : 48 .
In the women &apos;s race , I@@ rin@@ a Mi@@ kit@@ en@@ ko , a native of Kaz@@ ak@@ h@@ stan who is now a German citizen , completed a remarkable year by winning in 2 : 19 : 19 , the se@@ ven@@ th-@@ fastest time ever .
Pau@@ la Rad@@ cli@@ ffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2 : 15 : 25 .
Last spring , Mi@@ kit@@ en@@ ko , 36 , was a surprise winner of the London Mar@@ athon in 2 : 24 : 14 .
She missed the Beijing Games with what was described as a back injury , but recover@@ ed to win in Berlin , setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third mar@@ athon she has run .
She ran a race of smart calculation , letting a quar@@ tet of Ethiop@@ ian and Ken@@ yan run@@ ners break out to a wide lead , then re@@ eling them after about 18 ½ miles .
A@@ sk@@ ale T@@ af@@ a Mag@@ ar@@ sa of Ethiop@@ ia took second in 2 : 21.@@ 31 , while Hel@@ ena Ki@@ pro@@ p of Kenya finished third in 2 : 25 : 01 .
In a Town Apart , the Pri@@ de and Tri@@ als of Black Life
Hi@@ dden in the them@@ e-@@ park spra@@ w@@ l of greater Or@@ land@@ o , a few miles from the sh@@ iny , the loud and the gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an , lies a quiet town where the pride and complic@@ ations of the Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American experience come to life .
E@@ at@@ on@@ ville , the first all-@@ black town to incorporate in the country and the childhood home of Z@@ ora Ne@@ ale Hur@@ ston , is no longer as simple as she described it in 19@@ 35 : &quot; the city of five lakes , three cro@@ quet courts , 300 brown sk@@ ins , 300 good swi@@ mm@@ ers , plenty gu@@ av@@ as , two schools and no j@@ ail@@ house . &quot;
It is now a place of pilgri@@ ma@@ ge .
Ali@@ ce Wal@@ ker , T@@ oni Mor@@ ris@@ on and Ru@@ by De@@ e have come to the annual Z@@ ora ! Festival in E@@ at@@ on@@ ville to pay their respects to Hur@@ ston , the most famous female writer of the Har@@ lem Renaissance .
And yet in many ways , the town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the De@@ pres@@ sion-@@ era Federal Wri@@ ters &apos; Project - remains a place apart .
It is as independent , dign@@ i@@ fied and private as it was in the 1930@@ s , when Hur@@ ston wrote that rural bl@@ acks in Florida often resi@@ sted sharing their true thoughts with the white man , who &quot; knowing so little about us , he doesn &apos;t know what he is missing . &quot;
Even now , in a year when a black presidential nom@@ ine@@ e , Sen@@ ator Barack Obama , has called for an open conversation about race , many here remain war@@ y of the out@@ si@@ der &apos;s ga@@ ze .
&quot; We &apos;re very cau@@ tious about how our story is told , &quot; said Hor@@ ten@@ se Jones , 59 , a lifelong resident and member of the town &apos;s oldest church .
&quot; It needs to be right . &quot;
E@@ at@@ on@@ ville has long been defined as a parado@@ x of tri@@ umph and struggle .
It is both a historic model of black em@@ power@@ ment and a community of nearly 2,@@ 400 where the poverty rates are twice the national average .
It is a literary hub but also an o@@ ak@@ -@@ sha@@ ded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes dis@@ da@@ ined , sometimes pra@@ ised - that was born of American sla@@ very .
Not surpris@@ ingly , residents here are both proud and protective .
And the concern about E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s image really began with Z@@ ora , which is all anyone here calls Hur@@ ston .
She introduced the world to her hom@@ et@@ own through hear@@ t@@ felt , dial@@ ec@@ t-@@ heavy books like &quot; M@@ ules and Men &quot; ( 19@@ 35 ) and &quot; Their E@@ yes W@@ ere Wat@@ ching God &quot; ( 19@@ 37 ) .
Five paragraphs in the Florida gu@@ ide@@ book transformed the town , just off Route 17 , a road that runs through the oft@@ -@@ forgotten center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama .
B@@ old as a bass drum in both life and literature , Hur@@ ston led readers to the store owned by E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s first may@@ or , Jo@@ e Clar@@ ke , then ve@@ ered into more private areas .
&quot; O@@ ff the road on the left , &quot; she wrote , &quot; is the bro@@ wn@@ -@@ with@@ -@@ wh@@ it@@ e-@@ tri@@ m modern public school , with its well-@@ kept yards and play@@ grounds , which Ho@@ ward Mil@@ ler always looks after , though he can scar@@ c@@ ely read and write . &quot;
She also mentioned the new husband of Wi@@ dow D@@ ash and wrote that Lee Gl@@ enn &quot; s@@ ells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transi@@ ent rooms . &quot;
So in just a few hundred words , Hur@@ ston linked E@@ at@@ on@@ ville with self-@@ government but also illi@@ ter@@ acy , re@@ marriage and sex .
Clearly , Fo@@ dor &apos;s this was not .
In fact , it was not a portra@@ it everyone appreciated .
&quot; Z@@ ora told it like it was , &quot; said E@@ lla D@@ ink@@ ins , 90 , one of the John@@ son girls Hur@@ ston imm@@ or@@ tali@@ zed by quot@@ ing men singing off-@@ color songs about their beauty .
She added : &quot; Some people didn &apos;t like that . &quot;
Hur@@ ston is still remembered here as a vi@@ v@@ acious ec@@ cent@@ ric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jack@@ son@@ ville , F@@ la .
August@@ us Frank@@ lin , 77 , rec@@ alled that when Hur@@ ston sp@@ ed into town , she usually arrived without notice in a th@@ umping Che@@ v@@ ro@@ let , smoking and wearing pan@@ ts in a town that even today pri@@ des itself on dign@@ i@@ fied dress .
Most residents were fascin@@ ated , Mr. Frank@@ lin said , while many s@@ ne@@ ered .
&quot; People were always glad to see Z@@ ora , &quot; Mr. Frank@@ lin said .
But , he added , ro@@ cking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Lake Sa@@ be@@ lia , where Hur@@ ston was most likely b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed , &quot; she never did stay too long . &quot;
When Hur@@ ston died in 1960 , she was poor and her books had fallen out of print .
Along with much of the world , E@@ at@@ on@@ ville seemed to have forgotten her .
Though she was once a literary star , a contemporary of Lang@@ ston Hu@@ gh@@ es and the only black woman at Bar@@ n@@ ard College in the 19@@ 20@@ s , she was bu@@ ried in an un@@ marked grave in Fort Pier@@ ce , F@@ la . , where she had been living .
In E@@ at@@ on@@ ville , there were no major mem@@ orial services , no grand public read@@ ings .
&quot; I don &apos;t think they understood her contribution to the world or her legacy at all , &quot; said Val@@ erie Bo@@ y@@ d , author of &quot; W@@ ra@@ pped in Ra@@ in@@ bo@@ ws , &quot; a Hur@@ ston bi@@ ography published in 2003 .
A turning point came in the 1980s .
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-@@ lane highway through town to replace Ken@@ ne@@ dy Bou@@ levard , the community &apos;s put@@ tering two-@@ lane main street .
Or@@ land@@ o &apos;s spra@@ w@@ l had already pushed Inter@@ state 4 through the western edge of town .
The proposal came as E@@ at@@ on@@ ville was still recover@@ ing from a difficult period in its history .
For@@ ced integration , among other things , had ended the community &apos;s relatively idyllic isolation .
In the 1950@@ s , the fight over ra@@ cial mixing brought h@@ ate to the community &apos;s door@@ step .
&quot; During that time , a b@@ unch of white boys , they would come through and throw or@@ an@@ ges and things at people sitting down on the side , &quot; Mr. Frank@@ lin said .
&quot; We actually had a lady that got killed from that once .
They thre@@ w a water@@ mel@@ on out of the car . &quot;
In a 195@@ 5 letter to The Or@@ land@@ o S@@ ent@@ in@@ el , Hur@@ ston ques@@ tioned the Supreme Court &apos;s demand for forced integration , calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education &quot; insul@@ ting rather than hon@@ oring my race . &quot;
Re@@ sidents now say that the des@@ e@@ gre@@ gation of schools , while positive in some respects , di@@ l@@ uted E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s cohe@@ si@@ veness and undermined the confidence of its youth .
&quot; Black children were accu@@ stom@@ ed to being hu@@ gged - I remember this - you hu@@ gged your teacher in the morning , you hu@@ gged your teacher at night , &quot; said N@@ . Y@@ . Na@@ thir@@ i , the daughter of E@@ lla D@@ ink@@ ins and the executive director of Pre@@ serve the E@@ at@@ on@@ ville Community , a non@@ profit group .
That la@@ sted , she added , until the teachers and students did not come from the same place .
&quot; You were not hu@@ gging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there &apos;s a cultural divide there , &quot; M@@ s. Na@@ thir@@ i said .
Civil rights , however , helped create space for many more Z@@ ora Ne@@ ale Hur@@ st@@ ons - black writers , actors and artists who rose above prejudi@@ ce , like she did , with bu@@ o@@ y@@ ant self-@@ assurance and lines like : &quot; How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company !
It &apos;s beyond me . &quot;
In 1975 , the writer Ali@@ ce Wal@@ ker tre@@ k@@ ked to Hur@@ ston &apos;s un@@ marked grave and began fighting to res@@ ur@@ rec@@ t her reputation .
Five years later , an acc@@ laimed Hur@@ ston bi@@ ography by Robert E. Hem@@ en@@ way hit book@@ shel@@ ves , re@@ introducing her to the American can@@ on .
The highway project arrived just as E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s most famous daughter had once again found the spot@@ light .
And this time , Hur@@ ston &apos;s old neighb@@ ors saw her as a sa@@ vi@@ or .
The community began planning in 1988 for a Hur@@ ston festival to show what the county could ru@@ in with its highway .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of fans came to the inau@@ gu@@ ral event two years later , and each January , many return for the celebration .
After several years , the county backed away from its road proposal .
&quot; The five-@@ lan@@ ing of the highway res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , it put in what you &apos;d call war@@ p speed , real civi@@ c pride , &quot; M@@ s. Na@@ thir@@ i said .
M@@ s. Bo@@ y@@ d put it more simply : &quot; Z@@ ora saved E@@ at@@ on@@ ville . &quot;
Vic@@ tory over the highway project has helped change the town &apos;s self-@@ image .
Out@@ -@@ of-@@ to@@ wn@@ ers like R@@ ach@@ elle Mun@@ son , a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993 , started to appear in larger numbers , and residents started to re@@ value the past .
E@@ at@@ on@@ ville joined the national historic regi@@ stry in 1998 .
A new one-@@ story library ( named after Hur@@ ston , of course ) opened in 2006 on a rep@@ av@@ ed and beauti@@ fied Ken@@ ne@@ dy Bou@@ levard .
Today , E@@ at@@ on@@ ville remains a Florida an@@ om@@ al@@ y : only six miles from downtown Or@@ land@@ o , it can , at times , feel like a back street in a summer rain , as small as it did when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s .
( It is 90 percent black today . )
Out@@ si@@ ders who come looking for E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s story , its meaning , are often still treated with caution .
Ad@@ v@@ ance permission is required for most interviews , and certain things - like the mur@@ als at E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s oldest church , painted by a white man , showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photograph@@ ed .
Many in E@@ at@@ on@@ ville , like M@@ s. Jones , a bold , confident teacher partial to bright red , still fear that their insul@@ ar community will be mis@@ understood .
And yet , as the Hur@@ ston festival has expanded , a hei@@ gh@@ tened level of hom@@ et@@ own pride has also emerged .
Young people , in particular , tend to see E@@ at@@ on@@ ville as Hur@@ ston saw her entire race : beautiful , problems and all , no better , no worse and as proud , creative , hard-@@ working , sil@@ ly and mix@@ ed-@@ up as other ra@@ cial and ethnic groups in America .
It is sincere civi@@ c affec@@ tion that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Frank@@ lin &apos;s ne@@ p@@ he@@ w , Ed@@ win Harv@@ ey , 18 , who plans to come back to E@@ at@@ on@@ ville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department , which he said could use some help .
And even those who are younger , like Al@@ on@@ dra and Alex@@ ia Ken@@ on , 11-@@ year-old tw@@ ins from Winter Park , seem to have learned to describe E@@ at@@ on@@ ville correctly .
&quot; Most people , if they just drive through here , they &apos;ll think , &apos; O@@ h , this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones , &apos; &quot; Al@@ on@@ dra Ken@@ on said after church on a recent Sunday .
&quot; But if you actually stop and take a moment to look at the history , it &apos;s a very nice city . &quot;
Over here in New York we all speak flu@@ ent finance
On the face of it , nothing has changed .
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from news@@ stands and the gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an television screens in Times Square , they w@@ ouldn &apos;t realise they were standing in the eye of a storm .
They would never gu@@ ess that in the gl@@ ass@@ -@@ fron@@ ted , hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b offices above their heads the ban@@ kers and he@@ dge fund managers who monopoli@@ se New York are daily having the worst &quot; bad day at the office &quot; since the crash of 1929 .
Deli@@ very boys still r@@ attle metal tea trol@@ le@@ ys across side@@ walks , fer@@ rying tra@@ ys of mu@@ ff@@ ins for breakfast meetings .
Lat@@ ino men still sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le between apartment buildings carrying , like human mul@@ es , 50-@@ od@@ d pressed shi@@ rts han@@ ging from a yo@@ ke across their shoul@@ ders .
Office workers still wait in line for their morning ba@@ gel at p@@ av@@ ement food car@@ ts , and it is still impossible to get a yellow c@@ ab between 4@@ pm and 7@@ pm on a week@@ day .
It didn &apos;t feel as if there was a crisis at all , until , with all the talk of do@@ om and glo@@ om , I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon .
Even though I had tim@@ ed the ch@@ ore to coinci@@ de with the late afternoon l@@ ull at my local branch of J@@ P Morgan Ch@@ ase , a qu@@ eu@@ e of 20 or so people was already waiting in line .
Not in front of the t@@ eller windows , to withdraw cash or make a deposit , but in front of the customer service desk , where older clients order che@@ que books , tourists ask for directions to M@@ acy &apos;s department store and new customers open accounts .
Most of those ahead of me , I was to learn later from Star@@ r , my &quot; licensed personal ban@@ ker &quot; , were lining up for the same reason as me .
Unlike me , however , they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they comm@@ uted , from the likes of New Jer@@ sey , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania and St@@ aten Island .
They had taken out money from so-called thri@@ fts ( a bit like a building society ) , credit unions and the type of hom@@ et@@ own savings banks whose branches only operate within one state , and who say they treat customers like family .
In the past year , 15 of these banks have quiet@@ ly gone b@@ ust .
In the last few days Washington Mut@@ ual , a bank with $ 3@@ 27 billion of assets , went into recei@@ ver@@ ship , and as New Yor@@ kers headed home for the weekend on Friday night , another bank , Wach@@ o@@ via , with savings deposits of $ 4@@ 40 billion , was on the hun@@ t for a rescue buyer .
The office and shop workers standing in front of me , sc@@ ared of another collapse , were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be a safe haven , the bank that is doing most of the ba@@ iling out on Wall Street .
Or@@ din@@ ary New Yor@@ kers in the last few weeks have become flu@@ ent in finance .
A woman at my local Chinese super@@ market , speaking into her phone , referred to Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers , the b@@ ust bank , and its ga@@ un@@ t-@@ looking chief executive D@@ ick Ful@@ d with all the famili@@ arity as if she were bit@@ ching about an id@@ le colleague .
And Ly@@ n , the uni@@ formed , fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ something conci@@ er@@ ge of my apartment block , has changed t@@ ack from our normal topic of conversation about Bra@@ d and Angel@@ ina or my gro@@ cer@@ y delivery .
She told me , after my visit to the bank , that &quot; I got all my savings in money market funds now .
I &apos;ve swit@@ ched , I &apos;m not taking any risks . &quot;
Muslim gra@@ ves des@@ ec@@ rated as Austria sw@@ ings to the right
Hein@@ z-@@ Christian Stra@@ che , left of the Austrian right-@@ wing Austrian Freedom Party and Fili@@ p De@@ winter of Belgian right wing party V@@ la@@ ams Bel@@ ang , take part in a manifest@@ ation to present the organisation of &quot; Ci@@ ties against Islam@@ isation &quot; in Ant@@ wer@@ p , Thursday 17 January 2008 .
They carry traff@@ ic-@@ style signs depic@@ ting mos@@ ques with a red line running through .
Police are bl@@ aming far Right extrem@@ ists for des@@ ec@@ rating a Muslim c@@ eme@@ tery in Austria , the same weekend that the political parties of the far Right made huge gains in the country &apos;s general election .
Over 90 gra@@ ves were severely damaged at the c@@ eme@@ tery in Trau@@ n , near Linz , some time between Friday night and this morning , in what police believe was an organised action .
The offen@@ ders spra@@ yed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some of the gra@@ ves , but dete@@ c@@ tives believe this may have been a bid to dis@@ gu@@ ise the mo@@ tives of extrem@@ ists driven by a hat@@ red of Muslim immigrants .
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the local Islamic Community said they were &quot; deeply sho@@ cked &quot; at the news of the des@@ ec@@ ration , which comes as the Muslim religious month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ne@@ ars its end .
Austria is mean@@ while emb@@ ark@@ ing on a round of sou@@ l-@@ searching following its s@@ wing to the right in yesterday &apos;s parliamentary elections .
The two far-@@ Right parties that captured almost 30 percent of the vote , the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria , have campaign@@ ed on an veh@@ em@@ ently anti-@@ immigration ticket and some of their slo@@ gans were deemed xen@@ opho@@ b@@ ic by critics .
Hein@@ z-@@ Christian Stra@@ che , the head of the Freedom Party that won over 18 per cent of the vote , campaign@@ ed against head@@ scar@@ ves and bur@@ kas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam .
At his final rally in Vienna , he spoke of a &quot; European bro@@ ther@@ hood &quot; to prevent the rise of Islam .
Both parties seek to ban the building of mos@@ ques and min@@ are@@ ts , argu@@ ing that they were political symbols of an ongoing Islam@@ isation of Austria and Europe .
P@@ olls and analysis conducted immediately after the elections , which established the far Right as the country &apos;s strongest political blo@@ c , indicate that the change was brought about by predomin@@ ately young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union .
G@@ ary G@@ li@@ tter banned from trip abroad
G@@ ary G@@ li@@ tter , the gla@@ m rock star convi@@ cted of child sex abuse , has been banned by the courts from travelling to France and Spain .
Magi@@ str@@ ates imposed the six month ban on G@@ li@@ tter after he informed the authorities monitoring him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France .
Police in K@@ ent were granted the foreign travel ban last Thursday after giving ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ates evidence of G@@ li@@ tter &apos;s previous con@@ vic@@ tions for child sex abuse .
G@@ li@@ tter , real name , Paul G@@ add , did not attend the hearing at Ash@@ ford Magi@@ str@@ ates court in K@@ ent but he was represented by so@@ lic@@ it@@ ors Cor@@ ker B@@ inning .
A Court Service spo@@ kes@@ man said : &quot; On Thursday September 25 at Ash@@ ford Magi@@ str@@ ates &apos; Court , K@@ ent Police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to France and Spain until March 25 by Mr Paul G@@ add .
&quot; Paul G@@ add did not attend in person . &quot;
G@@ li@@ tter , 64 , had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to under the sex offen@@ ders register .
He must give the authorities notice if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days .
He is also required to give police seven days notice of his planned departure date .
F@@ ail@@ ure to notify the authorities could lead to a five year prison sentence .
K@@ ent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or the possible where@@ ab@@ outs of G@@ li@@ tter in the county .
A K@@ ent Police spo@@ kes@@ woman said : &quot; K@@ ent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country , or abroad .
&quot; From our point of view , it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risks more effectively .
&quot; Prote@@ cting the residents of K@@ ent is the par@@ amount concern of K@@ ent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offen@@ ders in the county to minim@@ ise any risk to the public that may exist . &quot;
G@@ li@@ tter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnam@@ ese j@@ ail for the abuse of two girls , aged 10 and 11 .
When he was fre@@ ed G@@ li@@ tter fle@@ w to Bangkok where he was due to board a flight to London .
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London .
The Thai authorities would not allow him through passport control and he eventually fle@@ w to Hong Kong .
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he fle@@ w back to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insi@@ sted he return to Britain .
He eventually arrived at Heathrow &apos;s Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his so@@ lic@@ it@@ or David Cor@@ ker went to U@@ x@@ bridge Magi@@ str@@ ates Court , west London , as Scotland Y@@ ard successfully applied for an order requiring him to register as a sex off@@ ender .
G@@ li@@ tter had previously been j@@ ailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for poss@@ essing images of child abuse .
A Home Office source said that J@@ acqu@@ i Smith , the Home Secretary was reas@@ su@@ red and glad that G@@ li@@ tter has been stopped from travelling to France and Spain .
&quot; I photogra@@ ph the master away from the scene to extract his character &quot; G@@ ün@@ ther Bauer , photographer
Neither he@@ els nor ru@@ ff@@ les or stage clothes .
Only the essence of the great masters of fl@@ amen@@ co , stri@@ pped of the concentration which character@@ izes the interpretation , to face a relaxed man or woman .
On one hand , the artist .
On the other , the person .
The two sides are in@@ separ@@ able , except in private life . In those moments , away from the public , the privacy of a gest@@ ure , the depth of a st@@ olen gl@@ ance or the expres@@ si@@ veness of the hands , are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage .
German G@@ ün@@ ther Bauer , in the work &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ People &quot; , altern@@ ates the theat@@ ri@@ c@@ ality of some shots of sing@@ ers , dan@@ c@@ ers and gu@@ it@@ ari@@ sts on stage with these masters &apos; private and less known being .
This is the photogra@@ ph &apos;s aim when collecting an original i@@ con@@ ography of fl@@ amen@@ co , taken from different perspectives .
The exhibition , included in the Mon@@ th of Fl@@ amen@@ co Phot@@ ography &apos;s program , reflects the importance of international fl@@ amen@@ co , which increases day by day &quot; the artist explains . He also clari@@ fies that in &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ People &quot; even it should be ordinary people , going through the pictures , the observers get these are not the classic images of artists , interpre@@ ters or perform@@ ers on stage .
The people I portra@@ yed on the street &quot; are &quot; artists able to convey passion , s@@ ad@@ ness and joy when on stage ... and finally , to capture their audience .
To catch the personality of these artists taking pictures of the scene is over .
It is much more an inner personality and character .
I &apos;m very interested in creating an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the gre@@ ats of fl@@ amen@@ co by my camera . &quot;
Bauer began his path to portra@@ y sing@@ ers , gu@@ it@@ ari@@ sts and dan@@ c@@ ers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival &quot; Can@@ te de las Min@@ as &quot; . He likes to use a plate camera .
Due to the choice of the camera and the equipment , These portra@@ its remember the classic photos .
The application of different sty@@ li@@ stic techniques breaks with the i@@ con@@ ographic traditional principles , giving the photos modern@@ ity , as Bauer considers fl@@ amen@@ co : &quot; A music with very traditional roots which evol@@ ves and still sur@@ prises every day more . &quot;
It is not the dancing , the singing or the playing itself , but the artist &apos;s personality , his character , able to con@@ quer the audience through his art .
The search for a meeting with the essenti@@ ality , with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling , are and have been constant elements in this work , now on display at the gallery El Fot@@ ó@@ mat@@ a .
Fam@@ ous fl@@ amen@@ co artists such as Die@@ go El C@@ ig@@ ala , Ch@@ an Lob@@ ato , Crist@@ ina Ho@@ y@@ os , En@@ ri@@ que Mor@@ ente , El Leb@@ ri@@ ja , Antonio Can@@ ales and Vic@@ ente Am@@ ig@@ o among others , are included in this selection of around sevent@@ y portra@@ yed artists .
The project has also become an anth@@ ology of fl@@ amen@@ co , going to be published in a book which collec@@ ts the portra@@ its displayed at the exhibition .
The passion for the portra@@ it led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with &quot; Por@@ tra@@ its of veter@@ an athle@@ tes &quot; ( &quot; Sport@@ ART@@ project &quot; ) .
Although in &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ People &quot; the concept is different , the photographer ad@@ mits &quot; I love to portra@@ y people , to know them and to penet@@ rate into their lives for a while , being this a long or short moment .
I think portra@@ y is the most difficult subject in photography .
You meet or face people and characters sometimes you even know or persons who be@@ sto@@ w you only a few minutes to take the picture .
Beyond circumstances , as a photographer , I always try to realize my ideas . &quot;
The collection of portra@@ its of contemporary fl@@ amen@@ co , entitled &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ people &quot; is exhi@@ bited at the gallery El Fot@@ ó@@ mat@@ a , Via de la Mat@@ a 20 , which is a parallel street to Al@@ ame@@ da de Her@@ cul@@ es . The exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of October .
Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a ad@@ mits the novel he &apos;s writing is a &quot; chance &quot;
The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject . Despite this , Mario Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a is stru@@ ggling with the new project he is working at , a novel whose pro@@ tagon@@ ist , Ro@@ ger Cas@@ em@@ ant , is an Irish nation@@ alist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and cro@@ ssed Ama@@ zon .
The writer , always favoured for the Nobel Prize in Liter@@ ature , conf@@ essed yesterday during the Ha@@ y Festival in Se@@ go@@ via , that the draft he is dealing with is a &quot; chance &quot; and that everything indicates that I should not write it down . &quot;
&quot; If I had good sense , I do not write it at all , but I &apos;m going ahead anyway and I hope to finish it once and for all , &quot; he concluded his speech at this festival for the exchange of ideas , thoughts and words that saw many guests , during the four days , passing by the Aqu@@ educ@@ t &apos;s city . H@@ und@@ reds of writers , hist@@ ori@@ ans and journalists and thousands of people joined it .
The author of &quot; La ci@@ u@@ dad y los per@@ ros &quot; was a prominent figure in the third edition of the word &apos;s festival , as forec@@ ast@@ ed .
Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a , who won the Ha@@ y Festival prize being the most voted writer by participants - an ancient edition of &quot; Our mutual friend &quot; by Di@@ ck@@ ens , packed the theatre Juan Bra@@ vo with fans .
In@@ tro@@ duced by F@@ é@@ li@@ x Rom@@ eo , the writer faced a public whose time fle@@ w away when the Peru@@ vian author , started to recall with a pro@@ di@@ gious memory and with large do@@ ses of hum@@ our , the way he discovered his literary vocation , derived from the &quot; extraordinary adventure and the pleasure of reading . &quot; This is &quot; living beyond life &quot; , as he put it in . He explained why or@@ derly basis in writing permits &quot; to remove the lack of inspiration , &quot; through an intense work of documentation , editing and re@@ vising . He under@@ lined how F@@ aul@@ k@@ ner , Vic@@ tor Hu@@ go and Alexand@@ re D@@ um@@ as affected his vocation and said that the &quot; images of memory &quot; are the foundation from which his stories spring up .
The His@@ pan@@ ic-@@ American nov@@ e@@ list , acknowledged that &quot; there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people &apos;s lives . I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and eph@@ emer@@ al entertainment experience , &quot; said Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a who , also supported that &quot; the literature has a strong impact and pus@@ hes people to be non@@ con@@ form@@ ist . &quot; So he suggested the writers &quot; not to give into fri@@ vo@@ lity &quot; and to &quot; take the responsibility &quot; of their own vocation .
We@@ ather ham@@ pers the Po@@ z@@ ob@@ lan@@ co festival , which remains with no bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts
The bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts which were to seal the days of the festival of Po@@ z@@ ob@@ lan@@ co were suspended yesterday morning after the bul@@ l figh@@ ters had assured that the square &apos;s soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations .
Therefore , the company , together with Fer@@ min Boh@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , P@@ ab@@ lo Her@@ mo@@ so de Men@@ do@@ za and Leonardo Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , decided to suspend the bul@@ l@@ fighting .
The weather was rather fi@@ erce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations .
Saturday , the rain had prevented the holding of the second bul@@ l@@ fight .
The b@@ ill@@ board included J@@ ose Lu@@ is Mor@@ eno , Cur@@ ro Di@@ az and Juan Bau@@ ti@@ sta , who would have faced a bul@@ l of Cas@@ til@@ blan@@ co .
So far , the only celebration took place on Friday .
This was the tri@@ umph of Daniel Lu@@ que , who cut three ears and was brought on shoul@@ ders after he had bul@@ l fought with taste and aes@@ the@@ tics .
The same afternoon Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro Tal@@ av@@ ante completed his two bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and collected gre@@ etings and one ear , granted by the public more than by the quality of the bul@@ l@@ fight itself .
Among all , the worst was El Juli , who passed by the bul@@ l-@@ ring of Los L@@ lan@@ os gaining no gl@@ ory , no penalty .
With the second bul@@ l , after a tremendous mu@@ le@@ ta , he earned the boo@@ s of a bigger part of the public .
A van loaded with two thousand ki@@ los of h@@ ash@@ ish ski@@ ps a road block in Ala@@ va
Ten to six in the morning .
Traff@@ ic control by the Er@@ tz@@ ain@@ tz@@ a in the municipal district of Ar@@ mi@@ ñ@@ ón ( Ala@@ va ) .
The officials order the two occup@@ ants of a van to stop but they , instead , give to fle@@ e .
Their cargo , more than two tons of h@@ ash@@ ish , is a good reason for not st@@ opping .
The officers ch@@ ase after them , are succeed in arre@@ sting one over two occup@@ ants . The man , 28 years old , is identified as A. A. J. , as reported in a press release by the Department of the Inter@@ ior of the Basque Government .
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and for@@ gery of public documents .
This occurred when some officials of the Ala@@ va High@@ way Police were conducting an audit of transp@@ orts along the N-@@ 1 , at the point which it cro@@ sses the district town of Ar@@ mi@@ ñ@@ ón .
They were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver , bre@@ ached of the orders , shar@@ ply acceler@@ ated and just ski@@ pped the road block .
The officials ch@@ ased the van until the vehicle stopped after a couple of miles on the edge of the road , and its two occup@@ ants fle@@ w into a woo@@ ded area .
The Er@@ tz@@ ain@@ tz@@ a officials managed to arrest one of the fu@@ gi@@ tives and , after the inspection of the van – an I@@ vec@@ o Da@@ ily , sei@@ zed 2@@ 17@@ 8 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of h@@ ash@@ ish .
The blocks of h@@ ash@@ ish , which were located in the rear of the vehicle , were subsequently placed under police cu@@ sto@@ dy for a deep investigation and detection of weight .
Moreover , since officials found that the chas@@ sis number had been &quot; duplic@@ ated &quot; because it did not coinci@@ de with the one reported in the van &apos;s documentation , the arrested man was also charged for public documents &apos; fal@@ si@@ fication .
The Er@@ tz@@ ain@@ tz@@ a is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspec@@ ted person who managed to fle@@ e as mentioned above , and to determine the origin of sei@@ zed drugs .
The prison@@ er , A. A. J. , 28 years old , was conducted to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures . He will be available to the court in the coming hours .
The ac@@ tress He@@ ather Lock@@ le@@ ar arrested for driving while ad@@ dic@@ ted with drugs
The ac@@ tress He@@ ather Lock@@ le@@ ar , Am@@ anda of the popular series Mel@@ rose Place , was arrested this weekend in Santa Bar@@ bara ( California ) after driving under the influence of drugs .
A witness viewed her performing inappropriate man@@ eu@@ vers while trying to take her car out from a parking in Monte@@ ci@@ to , as revealed to People magazine by a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Califor@@ ni@@ an High@@ way Police .
The witness stated that around 4.@@ 30@@ pm M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar &quot; crus@@ hed the acceler@@ ator very thoroughly , making excessive noise and trying to take the car out from the parking with ab@@ rupt back and forth man@@ eu@@ vers . By rever@@ sing , she passed several times in front of his s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses . &quot;
Shor@@ tly after , the witness , who , in a first time , apparently had not recognized the ac@@ tress , saw M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar st@@ opping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle .
It was this person to alert the emergency services , because &quot; he was concerned about M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar &apos;s life . &quot;
When the pat@@ rol arrived , the police found the ac@@ tress sitting inside her car , which was partially blocking the road .
&quot; She seemed confused , &quot; and for this reason the poli@@ c@@ emen led her to a specialized centre for drugs and alcohol and submitted her a test .
According to a spo@@ kes@@ man for the police , the ac@@ tress has proven collabor@@ ative and the hy@@ pothe@@ sis of excessive alcohol was dis@@ car@@ ded since the very first moment , even if &quot; as the officers observed at first sight , we believe M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar was under the effect of any drug . &quot;
M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar was arrested under suspi@@ cion of driving under the influence of some - not better specified substance , and im@@ pris@@ oned in the local j@@ ail at 7.@@ 00@@ pm , to be released some hours later .
Two months ago , M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar was out of a specialist clin@@ ic in Ari@@ zona where she was cu@@ red after an episode of anxi@@ ety and depression .
L@@ lam@@ az@@ ares ur@@ ges the Andalu@@ sian federation of I@@ U to assume its responsibilities in the Sil@@ va case
G@@ asp@@ ar L@@ lam@@ az@@ ares , the general coordin@@ ator of I@@ U and member of the party Iz@@ qui@@ er@@ da Uni@@ da , confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or for Youth and Sport of the city of Si@@ vig@@ lia , Francisco Manuel Sil@@ va , who re@@ signed last week after the accus@@ ation of c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism . The case will be up to the regional federation for training .
&quot; I &apos;m very feder@@ alist when considering this kind of issues , and the Andalu@@ sian organization needs to assume its responsibilities , &quot; said L@@ lam@@ az@@ ares regarding the resolution the party should adopt with the man who was an al@@ der@@ man in Si@@ vig@@ lian board until now .
Moreover , the leader stressed the need for &quot; transparency &quot; in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregul@@ arity Sil@@ va had committed , &quot; The U@@ I always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency . &quot;
Similarly , he stressed that training goes under &quot; very strict codes of ethics for all public functions . &quot;
&quot; San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o &quot; , an ep@@ ic challenge by Gar@@ ci .
J@@ ose Lu@@ is Gar@@ ci , inspired by the novel Ep@@ is@@ odi@@ os N@@ aci@@ on@@ ales of Ban@@ ito Pé@@ rez Gal@@ d@@ ó@@ s , recre@@ ates in San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o the span@@ ish popular ri@@ ot against the French . This is the most ambitious work of his fil@@ mo@@ graphy , with a nearly 15 million euro budget .
With this film , the director has tried to &quot; explain the tor@@ rent of characters and at the same time the social analysis &quot; that he always admi@@ red in the work of the famous nov@@ e@@ list , he said today , during the film &apos;s presentation , with Qu@@ im Gu@@ tier@@ rez and Pau@@ la Ech@@ ev@@ ar@@ r@@ ía heading a larger cast of interpre@@ ters .
San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o , a film longer than 2.@@ 30 hours , de@@ bu@@ ts this Friday at the cin@@ em@@ as , to become a four hours TV min@@ is@@ eries on Tele@@ Madrid in next future .
Great fan of Gal@@ d@@ ó@@ s &apos; literature , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Gar@@ ci claims this shooting realized &quot; a dream of his childhood &quot; . He likes to thank E@@ sper@@ an@@ za A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re , who , three years earlier , had commissioned him to shoot a film to commem@@ or@@ ate the second cent@@ en@@ ary of the Madrid 2nd of May . This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid . The director agreed on condition that the story ground@@ ed on the novel Ep@@ is@@ odi@@ os N@@ aci@@ on@@ ales .
The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Gar@@ ci a &quot; unique opportunity &quot; to recre@@ ate the appropriate sets and cost@@ umes to portra@@ y a &quot; stun@@ ned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the re@@ ign of Fer@@ din@@ and VII &quot; said Gar@@ ci .
However , the director regre@@ ts not having received equal funds of Al@@ atri@@ ste or Los fantas@@ mas de Go@@ ya - more than twice compared to San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o . So far , it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan , he himself had signed together with Hor@@ acio Val@@ car@@ cel , his care@@ er-@@ long collabor@@ ator .
The difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of Vol@@ ver a em@@ pe@@ z@@ ar : for example , the st@@ aging with the actors , with whom he often uses to re@@ hear@@ se before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast , considering this &quot; hum@@ ili@@ ating &quot; and thinking that &quot; the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on . &quot;
A certain number of interpre@@ ters , some of which fall within the cast of San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o , repeat in front of his vide@@ o-@@ camera . It is the case of Michael R@@ ell , Carlos L@@ arran@@ aga or Fern@@ ando Guil@@ len Cu@@ er@@ vo .
Four times in the O@@ scar nom@@ inations - winning one - Gar@@ ci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent Spain at Hollywood this year , his San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o , Sie@@ te mes@@ as de b@@ illar fran@@ c@@ és , and the Los selected uli@@ t@@ mo gi@@ ra@@ sol@@ es ci@@ e@@ gos do represent the Spanish cinema &apos;s younger generation , &quot; that should be known instead . &quot;
Gar@@ ci does not expect awards from this film .
&quot; At first you think of working for po@@ sterity , then you realize you only work for the prosperity , and at certain point you just shoot a film more , &quot; says Gar@@ cia after more 30 years of career .
Isa@@ bel Bay@@ on re@@ dis@@ covers the essence of the si@@ vig@@ lian dan@@ cer Tor@@ tol@@ a Valencia
A si@@ vig@@ lian dan@@ cer pays tribute to another si@@ vig@@ lian dan@@ cer .
Carmen Valencia Tor@@ tol@@ a , father from Catal@@ onia ( Flor@@ en@@ ç T@@ ó@@ r@@ tol@@ a Ferr@@ er ) and mother from Andalu@@ sia ( Geor@@ g@@ ina Valencia Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela ) , was born in the district of Tri@@ ana , and moved with her family to London when three .
She was a b@@ allet dan@@ cer and a free style and ori@@ ental dan@@ ces &apos; specialist .
Her life was rather fascinating and she was a pione@@ er of women &apos;s eman@@ cip@@ ation , such as Is@@ ad@@ ora Dun@@ can , Vir@@ g@@ inia Wo@@ olf or Sar@@ ah Bern@@ hardt .
She was Buddh@@ ist and veget@@ arian , and defended the cause for the cor@@ set &apos;s abolition because it prevented women from moving freely .
The life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aes@@ the@@ tics of dance in Europe between the two wars , had always fascin@@ ated Isa@@ bel Bay@@ on .
&quot; I &apos;d liked to work with Pep@@ a Gam@@ boa , and she proposed me to interpret this character . It seemed to me incredible . &quot;
According to the dan@@ cer &quot; we do not pre@@ tend to tell her whole life , but to collect her spirit .
Her dan@@ ces &apos; titles suggested me some elements of fl@@ amen@@ co .
Thus , &quot; la dan@@ za de la Mari@@ pos@@ a &quot; suggested me a gu@@ aj@@ ira , or the &quot; dan@@ za de la ser@@ pi@@ ente &quot; some tan@@ gos .
Her dance was sen@@ su@@ al and I was told my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic , too &quot; she says .
The st@@ aging includes two outstanding contributions : that of Miguel Po@@ ve@@ da , who will sing again Isa@@ bel in one of the shows , the same he did in &quot; La pu@@ er@@ ta ab@@ ier@@ ta &quot; , and the master M@@ ati@@ l@@ de Cor@@ al , which exceptionally wanted to work together with a former student of h@@ ers .
&quot; M@@ ati@@ l@@ de interpre@@ ts Tor@@ tol@@ a in the adul@@ th@@ ood , she is the character of mat@@ urity .
I &apos;m very happy she accepted to play in my work and I feel very hon@@ oured for this . &quot;
The st@@ aging also includes the musical composition and gu@@ it@@ ari@@ sts such as Jesus Tor@@ res and P@@ aco Arri@@ aga , sing@@ ers as Miguel Or@@ te@@ ga , Pul@@ ga y Mo@@ i of Mor@@ ón and the percus@@ sion of El P@@ á@@ j@@ aro , the viol@@ a of Raf@@ a El Vi@@ ola and the collaboration of an actor , Ju@@ an@@ fra@@ n Ju@@ á@@ rez &quot; who plays the role of e@@ ternal compan@@ ion of artists like her , who were real round stars , and always had many lovers . &quot;
This work also tell something of this woman &apos;s life because it was mainly held in distant places , particularly for her time , such as India , United States or Russia , as well as the whole Europe , using her to re@@ side in London .
&quot; I wanted to remember her , because I think she was one of that women who had an enormous influence in a specific historical period . Nowadays nobody re@@ members of her and even considers her work as something of value &quot; supports Bay@@ on .
The show will be on stage starting from today , 20.@@ 30@@ pm , at the theatre L@@ ope de Veg@@ a .
The publication &quot; Di@@ ario de un po@@ eta reci@@ én cas@@ ado &quot; clo@@ ses the 3 Y@@ ears An@@ ni@@ versary &apos;s celebration
The presentation of the first illustr@@ ated edition of &quot; Di@@ ario de un Po@@ eta Rec@@ ien@@ cas@@ ado &quot; at Saint Stephen &apos;s Church ( New York ) , the place where Juan Ram@@ ón Jim@@ é@@ nez married Zen@@ ob@@ ia in March 19@@ 16 , falls within the plan made by the Department of Culture of the Committee of Andalu@@ sia to celebrate the &quot; 3 Y@@ ears An@@ ni@@ versary of Zen@@ ob@@ ia and Juan Ram@@ on &quot; ( 200@@ 6-@@ 2008 ) , organized to commem@@ or@@ ate the fif@@ tieth anniversary of the allocation of the Nobel Prize in Liter@@ ature and the death of both .
So far , the &quot; 3 Y@@ ears An@@ ni@@ versary of Zen@@ ob@@ ia and Juan Ram@@ on &quot; ends with the second edition of this work , with the International Congress held in New York , the restoration of the hou@@ se-@@ museum of the Nobel pri@@ zed and the travelling exhibition &quot; Juan Ram@@ ón Jim@@ é@@ nez : Aqu@@ el cho@@ p de lu@@ z &quot; , which was inau@@ gur@@ ated last May and , after having touched the various provin@@ ces of Andalu@@ sia , is expected to be brought to New York in conjunction with the International Congress .
In addition , the Department of Culture of the Committee of Andalu@@ sia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the &quot; Di@@ ario de un Po@@ eta Rec@@ ien@@ cas@@ ado &quot; , edited by Peter Tab@@ ern@@ ero and illustr@@ ated by James Per@@ e@@ z-@@ En@@ c@@ is@@ o , to promote and spread the figure and the works of one of the highest Andalu@@ sian po@@ ets .
We like America a bit less without Paul New@@ man
&quot; Sometimes God creates perfect people .
Paul New@@ man was one of those . &quot;
The sentence is by S@@ ally Fiel@@ d , who worked with him in &quot; Aus@@ encia de mali@@ cia &quot; and gives the feeling of American cinema &apos;s im@@ poten@@ ce , and throughout America , facing the shock that New@@ man has gone .
And awar@@ ding him with an O@@ scar had been quite hard .
And in 2007 he had reti@@ red .
And people also knew he was very ill .
Although this , it was a very hard blow for all .
&quot; Sometimes your feelings go far beyond any word , and now I lost a great friend , &quot; cri@@ ed Robert Red@@ ford , &quot; my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence . &quot;
No one was afraid of result ridicul@@ ous or exagger@@ ate .
A father of the cinema and of the country had died in a particularly dark period , with the fear of terrorists and markets , with American people &apos;s self-@@ este@@ em on the ground , desper@@ ately seeking new reasons to feel worthy .
When times are so difficult , men so less virtu@@ ous and with very few beings admi@@ red by people , you have not to be Lu@@ is C@@ ern@@ u@@ da to love Paul New@@ man .
For all people he embo@@ died the Plat@@ onic ideal of beauty and truth .
He was an official enemy of Richard Ni@@ x@@ on and a suppor@@ ter of lost and won causes , starting from the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the fir@@ st@@ born who died of over@@ do@@ ses until the promotion of a new brand for hom@@ e-@@ made and organic food .
All gifts he did to a country which had to pay huge costs to go beyond a suici@@ dal food culture .
The wave of admi@@ ration went beyond Hollywood , independently from nationality or passport .
The latest James B@@ ond , the English actor Daniel Cra@@ ig , observed that this is not a dead man , it is an era which is over .
Another English man , S@@ am Men@@ des , a director who won the O@@ scar , said that working with New@@ man was nothing less than the highest peak of his career .
The bad boy arrived from Australia , Rus@@ sell Cro@@ we , arrived to define Paul New@@ man as his biggest inspiration .
&quot; He left an example of the highest level for all of us , &quot; notes George Clo@@ on@@ ey , perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul New@@ man did : maintaining in high consideration the need for rec@@ titude and having a serious private life , away from the cameras .
This is not always easy or possible in contemporary media jung@@ le .
However , some people will try and Paul New@@ man will remain a very good example to get them inspired .
After the di@@ vor@@ ce , his second marriage with Jo@@ anne Woo@@ d@@ ward la@@ sted fif@@ ty years long , and he remained fai@@ thful having certainly opportunities for not being so .
&quot; Why am I going out to have my ham@@ bur@@ gers , when I can have a good ste@@ ak at home ? &quot; used to jo@@ ke himself .
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his dau@@ gh@@ ters who are also his fans on the earth , something not so common in America .
&quot; Of all the major roles he interpreted , none he was so proud of than that of devoted husband , lo@@ ving father , attentive grand@@ father and passion@@ ate phi@@ lan@@ th@@ rop@@ ist &quot; they say .
The im@@ perfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes , the dream of many of us is that one day Olymp@@ ics will be held in Madrid and , after the failed attempt in 2012 , this could happen in 20@@ 16 .
But I wonder , are we ready ?
If we follow the example of yesterday race , I just say no !
They called it the &quot; perfect race &quot; but in my opinion it was by far the worst I witnessed .
All a non@@ sense , that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it , the output would be totally negative .
But let &apos;s go with order and start from the very beginning .
The non@@ sense began with the collection of the back number , which pre@@ supposed you went there before the race .
It did not seem a bad idea , but if you &apos;re forced to go , it should be to withdraw all things ( including the chip to avoid qu@@ eu@@ es during the race ) .
But this was not .
We went there just to collect the back number ( first non@@ sense , just go for this only reason ) and ( after the qu@@ eu@@ e ) , surprise ! they only had &quot; S &quot; size T-@@ shi@@ rts ( second non@@ sense , because I need an X@@ L ) .
What kind of world are we living in ?
Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T-@@ shi@@ rts , made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive ?
Well , these things were nothing if compared with the day of the race .
We had to go very early to collect the chip but the qu@@ eu@@ e was 15 minutes long and , furthermore , you had to deposit your back@@ pack .
The wait la@@ sted more than 35 minutes , something in@@ comprehensible for a race where you expect more than 11@@ ,000 people .
Then , as expected , the race started when we had not even handed over the back@@ pack , although , once succeeded , the recovery was even worse .
In addition , the rain threatened the waiting longer than 40 minutes , which went along with a kind of popular re@@ bel@@ lion and an attempted ass@@ ault to stand .
I believe we will be around 500 people surely with p@@ neum@@ onia tomorrow , and some , like me , not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chip , which , I sup@@ pose , did not record the arrival time properly .
In future , if I will be asked for the perfect race , this one w@@ ont &apos;t certainly enter in my thoughts .
At the end of the day , I think we will continue to dream of an Olympic and well prepared city .
Microsoft looks for a ( virtual ) recep@@ tion@@ ist
During the conference on Emer@@ ging Technologies at the M@@ IT , Microsoft presented a preview of the new recognition and human interaction system , a kind of artificial intelligence , but without that much intelligence , able to perform some basic tasks , such as call a taxi ( or , in the scenario described by Microsoft , a shuttle service to move within the company &apos;s camp@@ us ) &quot; understanding &quot; what happens in a standard conversation .
Thanks to a camera and a forms and faces &apos; recognition system , this &quot; recep@@ tion@@ ist &quot; may know how many people are there in a specific room , who are they – including remember what &apos;s their position - and listen and understand the key@@ words in a conversation with them .
It may also clu@@ stered people in groups of conversation .
The demo showed that the recep@@ tion@@ ist notes a third person , understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company &apos;s employee .
It asks him if he &apos;s there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible .
This without any aw@@ ful blue screen .
A@@ wes@@ ome .
But this is the future , of course .
Now the company needs to focus on many other issues , such as the next Windows operating system &apos;s release .
This week it was a big talk on Microsoft &apos;s change of strategy .
Windows 7 will be ligh@@ ter and will not be charged with so many programs .
Steve Ball@@ mer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rub@@ b@@ ish , these should be five times faster - h@@ ey ! Steve , will be for less .
A real discovery , if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft , version after version has only added features and &quot; ex@@ tras &quot; to Windows .
The change of direction is very welcome .
Microsoft is right : the operating system will be increasingly losing importance , and the software with it .
When Google launched Chro@@ me , I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with Windows .
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system .
The operating system will be always a necessity because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate .
It perform@@ s the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mo@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law .
It &apos;s true .
It won &apos;t ever disappear , perhaps you just need to think about the &quot; death &quot; of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one .
What Ball@@ mer said this week confirms this idea .
People give less attention to the operating system , and increasingly focus on the browser .
They only use the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chro@@ me - daily and spend a longer time brow@@ sing the web rather than working in a window environment .
What half of the operating system &apos;s applications are there for ?
L@@ ess is more .
And Windows 7 should be less , much less than Vista .
L@@ ess heavy , less loaded , less complex .
A Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should constitute a viable alternative to Google .
Ac@@ tually , they desper@@ ately need it . Let &apos;s take a little example .
I shot the photo of this post during the Microsoft employees &apos; break , in Red@@ mond , earlier this month .
A sign , han@@ ging on the soft drinks &apos; machine suggested them to use the company &apos;s search engine - &quot; Your search . Our Future &quot; .
In 2006 , an independent study reached the conclusion that the 66 % of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the net .
Last week , moreover , Microsoft confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 .
It will not be launched on the market at the beginning of 2009 , but even at the end , maybe in 2010 .
Microsoft surely will try a joint launch , Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together .
Our phones , at the very end , is increasingly becoming a computer .
But the delay , with Andro@@ id and the iPhone already on marketing , will result detri@@ mental .
The Fab@@ u@@ leu@@ x Mar@@ cel
P@@ ab@@ lo Pic@@ asso used to dress it while in the French Riviera , Leonardo di Cap@@ ri@@ o sh@@ one with one of this in &apos; Diam@@ ante de san@@ gr@@ e &apos; by Ed@@ ward Z@@ wick , as well as Al P@@ ac@@ ino in &apos; The Go@@ d@@ father &apos; of Franc@@ is Ford C@@ opp@@ ola . Moreover , it is part of the typical uniform worn by the mus@@ cular ga@@ y parish .
If we try to count the number of stars wearing it , we can also recall the image of the stron@@ g-@@ built man with pointed mu@@ sta@@ che who li@@ fted wei@@ ghts in the stro@@ lling cir@@ cus .
Finally , this is nothing more than the typical T-@@ shirt for men , with a cotton interior , tight and sle@@ e@@ vel@@ ess shape .
It is the &apos; tank &apos; , as English speakers call it , though , the Brussels Fab@@ u@@ leu@@ x Mar@@ cel stands out above all .
First of all , this is due to its gran@@ di@@ ose name - even if it is commonly known just as &quot; Mar@@ cel &quot; - name that has something to do with the sport because it deri@@ ves , according to the legend , from the bo@@ xer Mar@@ cel Cer@@ dan , who loved the singer Edi@@ th Pi@@ af .
The &quot; Mar@@ cel &quot; exc@@ els - if compared to the others - for its high quality cotton , for its un@@ is@@ ex cutting , for his distinctive little shi@@ eld and the small Belgian flag ( barely recogn@@ iz@@ able ) , which the most em@@ ble@@ matic models keep as a detail on the neck .
And open your eyes ! , because the Belgian company does not produce only its famous &quot; tank &quot; .
The production also includes college swe@@ ats , vin@@ tage bo@@ x@@ ers , cas@@ h@@ mere car@@ di@@ gans , cotton tro@@ users , sail@@ or shi@@ rts , bab@@ y-@@ d@@ olls , mini sh@@ orts ...
Gar@@ ments meant to be comfortable .
It is a pity to use them as under@@ wear .
They &apos;re too smart .
&quot; I want to be a young mother , doesn &apos;t matter the candidate &quot;
The great res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance with her sister has not prevented her from developing a strong personality .
Mon@@ ica Cruz is a tiny woman , but still , full of vit@@ ality .
Currently , both the Cruz si@@ sters have taken very seriously their new activity in the fashion field .
According to Mon@@ ica , it is much more than beautiful girls and celeb@@ ri@@ ties who lend their names .
She went to Paris for the campaign Man@@ go is han@@ ging on to promote the new branch , and the presentation of the most important prizes for fashion spon@@ sored by the Spanish fashion house .
War@@ m and tim@@ id , she con@@ qu@@ ers you quite quickly .
T@@ ell us what you &apos;re doing in Paris .
I came here to present the new collection my sister Pen@@ el@@ ope and I have designed for the new Man@@ go aut@@ um@@ n-@@ winter season , to join the second edition of &apos; Man@@ go Fas@@ hion Awards &apos; and the Opera dinner in honour of Val@@ entino .
Let &apos;s say , a very intense day but a very exciting one , at the same time .
What is the inspiration of your new collection for Man@@ go in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house ?
Both my sister that I like the cinema of the 50@@ s and 6@@ 0s . From there we get bigger inspi@@ rations .
Then , I like to get lost in the city and look at how women dress , at the way they combine and mix their clothes . I do it quite frequently .
Dan@@ cer , ac@@ tress and designer , you &apos;re a very versatile woman , aren &apos;t you ?
I think so , although at the very end , all mer@@ ged and many elements remain cross-@@ field ideas .
I liked clothes since I was a child . I loved to visit my grand@@ mother to rum@@ ma@@ ge in my a@@ unt &apos;s c@@ up@@ boards and discover her clothes .
It was so good ! , much better than going to the am@@ us@@ ement park .
Then , once a dan@@ cer , I always took great care of my dres@@ sing .
It is known dan@@ c@@ ers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance rec@@ it@@ als , to look themselves in the mirror and feel good .
And in the ac@@ tress role , when you are delivered the war@@ dro@@ be , this is the time you actually encounter the character .
So , everything goes together , yes , with a lot of respect for designers and professionals .
Not long ago , you celebrated your 30 years , did you entered a crisis ?
Ab@@ sol@@ utely I didn &apos;t .
I &apos;ve never felt better , I like to be 30 years old .
I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors .
I &apos;m not sc@@ ared by the biological clock .
Since I was a child , I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness .
So , are you thinking of being mother or not ?
Yes , of course , I &apos;m . I know it is my same body pushing me for this and also I want to be a young mo@@ m , I &apos;m not g@@ onna miss it .
And about the candidate … Does not matter that much .
I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educ@@ ate him with bigger love .
Tal@@ king about cinema , you are waiting the release of some films you acted last year .
That is , and I &apos;m really curi@@ ous about that .
Com@@ ing from the theat@@ rical experience , I am a very imp@@ ati@@ ent and anxi@@ ous woman , I want everything now and clearly , but I know this may not be always possible .
I &apos;m looking forward mainly for &quot; La ú@@ l@@ tima hor@@ a &quot; and &quot; En bus@@ ca de la tum@@ ba de Crist@@ o &quot; .
Let &apos;s see if you like it ...
Fe@@ w days ago you deb@@ uted on the cat@@ walk side by side with Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , didn &apos;t you ?
Well , don &apos;t put it this way .
It &apos;s not I was on the cat@@ walk as a professional model .
Simply Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , whom I know since a long time , called and invited me to go to London and attend a char@@ ity fashion show for her organization &quot; Women for a Better World &quot; . The clothes presented during the show - I brought two pieces from our collection for Man@@ go - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this Na@@ om@@ i &apos;s NG@@ O .
People usually ignore this Na@@ om@@ i &apos;s tender heart .
It is said so many things on her , that , knowing her quite well , I can assure you are not true .
Moreover , I like to share and get involved in this good part of h@@ ers .
She asked me to be shown for a noble cause , but if I had asked to play a pine , I would do it anyway .
You cannot back out of helping the third world women .
Dri@@ vers re@@ tic@@ ent of alcoholi@@ sm should install the &apos; al@@ colo@@ ck@@ &apos;
The Inter@@ ior Office wants the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoholi@@ c rate , to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when dr@@ un@@ k . The same if you do not blow into the measuring device .
The measure was announced last June and has been already included in the Annual Report of the State Att@@ or@@ ney General , according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year .
This project &apos;s goal is the rein@@ statement of the driver , since he will need to attend a course of road re-@@ education .
The initiative is supported by the Att@@ or@@ ney General for Road Safety , together with the General Direc@@ torate of Traff@@ ic ( D@@ G@@ T ) and the Techn@@ ological Institute Foundation for Security in the Automob@@ ile ( F@@ IT@@ S ) .
According to statistics , between 30 % and 75 % of drivers fined more than once for dr@@ un@@ k driving , still drive a car .
The &apos; al@@ colo@@ ck &apos; would avoid this , because the device , connected to the vehicle , measures the rate of alcohol in bre@@ ath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it , or in case it dete@@ cts in the car an higher alcoholi@@ c concentration than permitted by law .
The cost of the device , a bit more than 1000 euro , should be charged to the sanc@@ tioned .
In this regard , a study conducted in 2007 in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infrin@@ gements up to 65 % during the first year of introduction .
And in Spain it was estimated it could save around 115 lives in one year .
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons : first of all to stop these behavi@@ ors before they turn into criminal off@@ enses .
And second , to facilitate the implementation of this practice , as the legal reform can be ordin@@ arily made , but , on the contrary , the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law .
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution , even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transp@@ orts .
Just tomorrow , the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties will vote a PS@@ O@@ E &apos;s initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in school buses , as has already been done in France .
In Mexico , and without her pe@@ ep@@ -@@ to@@ es &quot;
In line with the British pun@@ ctu@@ ality , at 17.@@ 40 pm , perfectly on schedule , the Spanish airline land@@ ed at the presidential han@@ gar of Ben@@ ito Ju@@ á@@ rez airport in Mexico City , bringing there the Prices of Ast@@ uri@@ as .
The sun@@ set was almost done but the sun &apos;s rays still forced you to use your hand as a vis@@ or to see the royal couple getting off the plane .
The Spanish amb@@ assador and other authorities stood at the foot of the lad@@ der .
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver , along the street , if he knew that the Spanish prin@@ ces were about visiting the city to formali@@ ze an official travel .
- A@@ h , very good , so we cannot go to the airport and collect people in that time band ... Is she from here or ...
- No , no si@@ r , she is Spanish , but lived in your country for a couple of years .
- A@@ h , well ...
On the way round , the Mexican press perfectly knows who are the prin@@ ces of Ast@@ uri@@ as and is aware of the importance of the travel .
Many are those who wait for them at the airport &apos;s han@@ gar , crow@@ ded together on the red car@@ pet and closed to a military line composed by 27 n@@ avy soldiers offering the honour gre@@ eting .
The pr@@ ince appears sm@@ iling , with a n@@ avy blue dress , and she , the pr@@ inc@@ ess , hair in the wind , very so@@ ber , does not wear her &quot; pe@@ ep@@ -@@ to@@ es &quot; as usual . Perhaps she had been reported Mexico City is threatened by bad weather .
They give photograph@@ ers a s@@ mile and a brief sto@@ po@@ ver before moving to the room where the official group is looking forward to them .
By the door of the hotel where they &apos;re going to stay , one of the biggest four in the city , a fun@@ ny re@@ porter of Mexican television wa@@ its for them .
The best fashion award
Pro@@ b@@ ably there is not a more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award , and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as Val@@ entino .
Man@@ go has just presented the second edition of El Bot@@ ó@@ n-@@ Man@@ go Fas@@ hion Awards , to support the international promotion of new tal@@ ents in the fashion field .
It offers a prize of 300@@ ,000 euros .
Yesterday , Sand@@ rin@@ a Fas@@ oli , the Belgian winner of the first edition , looked at his drawings in the Man@@ go &apos;s window at the number 54 of Bou@@ levard Haus@@ s@@ mann – Paris , and was almost cr@@ ying for emo@@ tion .
Moreover , the company &apos;s store is the second largest in Europe , recently opened on 13@@ 35 square meters &apos; space .
The most important one is located in London .
The numerous events , combined with the desire to please the designer Val@@ entino who ch@@ ai@@ red the jury of the contest , brought us to a luxury dinner at the Gar@@ nier Opera in Paris .
The proximity of the most exquisite paintings by Cha@@ gal made the presidential g@@ ala table prepared by Man@@ go even more spectacular .
Nat@@ i , with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity , because of the recent death of her brother , wor@@ e a dress of the company and fashion comple@@ ments by E@@ LA@@ H that took your bre@@ ath away . So , arm in arm with her son Lu@@ is - a two meters height boy - accompanied Val@@ entino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized .
An@@ di@@ k , owner and master of Man@@ go , welcomed the guests and as the gentle@@ man he is , along with Bar@@ on Rot@@ ch@@ il arrived at the end of the night without his jack@@ et , because both had granted it to two ladies .
Mon@@ ica Cruz , who ran the shop in tro@@ users and shirt - designed by herself – changed her dress for the dinner , wearing a very sen@@ su@@ al long black dress . She got very exc@@ ited when , during the night walk inside the opera house , accompanied by Go@@ ya Tol@@ edo , we were shown the room for dance rec@@ it@@ als , and rec@@ alling other times , she gra@@ b@@ bed a bar and outlined a &quot; grand p@@ lie &quot; .
In@@ és Sa@@ str@@ e did not join the walk inside the building , but before leaving , showed us her son &apos;s photos on her mobile phone .
Next morning we welcomed the presence of Oli@@ vier Mart@@ ine@@ z - another boy who likes moving by motor@@ bike - and John Tra@@ vol@@ ta , who arrived at the Inter@@ continental Hotel of Paris , bringing his own sheets , towels and only after asking to have no sm@@ ells in his room .
Stars under the star@@ lit Paris sky .

10@@ 01 , the number anti-@@ stress
It is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 the way to forget the cha@@ o@@ tic and hec@@ tic everyday life .
And if it seems not enough , all these ways have been collected in a book which will bring the relax to the book@@ stores by the 30@@ th of September .
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when ring@@ ing every morning at 7 o &apos;@@ clock , but the worst is ima@@ ging yourself involved in the fran@@ tic pace dict@@ ated by modern life .
Office means tension , computer back pain .
Stress is the illness of the twenty-@@ first century .
However , you are offered now neither one nor two ways to combat daily exhaus@@ tion and the struggle in taking a proper distance from the work &apos;s dimension ,
but no more no less than 10@@ 01 ways .
Beyond yo@@ ga positions , the classic massage or the &quot; spa &quot; treatments , Sus@@ ann@@ ah Mar@@ ri@@ ott collec@@ ts in the pages of her book , a &quot; menu &quot; full of options tailored to individual tastes and needs .
The anti-@@ stress work is ti@@ tled &quot; 10@@ 01 ways to relax &quot; and will be available in the libraries thanks to Pear@@ son Al@@ ham@@ bra and D@@ K publi@@ shers .
If someone believes winning the peace in areas such as business or personal relationships is not possible , this &quot; manual &quot; den@@ ies that belief .
It also suggests alternatives , such as staying in touch with nature , or provides 100 % natural recip@@ es that help to relax .
If the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine is not already f@@ lowing in your v@@ eins to produce the balance of the body and stress has become a major problem for you , it &apos;s time to sit on the cou@@ ch , turn off your mind and focus on reading .
Spe@@ aking while sleeping
Some children speak during the night .
I am not referring to those who wake up very ag@@ it@@ ated to tell us something happened to them the day before , but those children who talk while as@@ le@@ ep .
The first time it happens , at most , you get sc@@ ared , but it really does not have that much importance .
This is a ben@@ ign alter@@ ation of sleep , defined som@@ ni@@ lo@@ qu@@ y .
It is a quite common phenomenon , especially in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents .
Certainly , most of you have been told talked in your sleep .
This phenomenon can occur very spor@@ adi@@ cally ( just once in life , for example , associated with an episode of high fe@@ ver ) or on a more regular basis ( every day , once a week , once in the month ... ) . The day after the child does not remember anything .
There is not a single reason to explain the presence of som@@ ni@@ lo@@ qu@@ y .
Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep dis@@ orders such as night@@ ma@@ res , night fears , no@@ c@@ turn@@ al en@@ ure@@ sis ( do pe@@ e in bed ) , or sle@@ ep@@ walking , but it is not necessarily the case .
As mentioned above , it may be associated with stages of very high fe@@ ver , in situations of stress or over exc@@ itement .
In any case , this phenomenon is not resear@@ ched that well .
Even its intensity is extremely variable .
It may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice , with loose words , almost in a wh@@ is@@ per , or the opposite ( scre@@ ams , cri@@ es , long speeches ... ) .
In case the event is particularly intense , the child should be observed and possibly , a specialist should be consulted to check if the ab@@ normal state of anxi@@ ety is due to any question , thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings .
We said that this is a ben@@ ign alter@@ ation , therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep dis@@ orders which , instead , can be treated ( for example , if coupled with in@@ som@@ nia or a situation of stress ) .
What you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very simple preventive measures , such as :
Try not to over-@@ exc@@ ite the child before going to sleep .
Pro@@ pose calm games and avoid television programs or series that insp@@ ire fear or suggest violence .
Very ner@@ vous children for whom relaxing is a very hard task , need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm .
This will allow the child to sleep more peace@@ fully .
Once som@@ ni@@ lo@@ qu@@ y appears , try to keep calm .
Remember that it is an in@@ offensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it .
U@@ se@@ ful Ti@@ ps
Don &apos;t wake him up .
It is us@@ eless , because he is not aware of what is going on , and you just inter@@ rupt his sleeping .
Although he is talking , he is as@@ le@@ ep and thus , he is re@@ sting .
Remember that if he appears very an@@ gu@@ ished and the ep@@ iso@@ des have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such a great anxi@@ ety comes from .
If you get what he is saying ( which is not the most common situation ) does not fall into temp@@ tation to make him an inter@@ ro@@ gation to obtain information .
Do not get anything , because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts .
In addition , you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dre@@ aming about to say that things . Therefore , be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead .
Do not ever tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secre@@ ts .
Not even jo@@ k@@ ingly .
This can generate a huge anxi@@ ety .
In short , do not worry , it &apos;s nothing serious , just an episode that la@@ sts few minutes .
I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern ... finally
I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern has finally reg@@ a@@ ined its path to victory on its own soil after a long period of drau@@ ght .
Without playing a great match , the Y@@ ellow and Black have created the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner .
The rhyth@@ m was not very steady during the match and the attack@@ ers found it hard to express themselves .
After a first attempt by the guest cap@@ tain K@@ auff@@ mann who narro@@ w@@ ly missed the goal from a far shot , I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern went on to take a slight lead and in turn F@@ onder@@ f@@ lick from af@@ ar , then with Hir@@ n from high , Rom@@ ain with the tip of his foot or again Die@@ bold came to ti@@ ck@@ le the D@@ ann@@ em@@ ar@@ ie defence .
At the front , there was a mid@@ field block that allowed just the centre forward Ri@@ ah@@ i at the fore@@ front of the attack .
The beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Ri@@ ah@@ i and Tem@@ por@@ ale for D@@ ann@@ em@@ ar@@ ie , immediately after the score was opened for I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern@@ s by Mar@@ ais , well positioned to pick up a ball bo@@ un@@ ced off an initial attempt by Die@@ bold ( 53 &apos; ) .
But the I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern stri@@ ker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the lo@@ cker room a do@@ zen minutes later , leaving his te@@ am-@@ m@@ ates numer@@ ically in@@ fer@@ ior .
But D@@ ann@@ em@@ ar@@ ie could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern Ele@@ ven who just fell back a little to make its defence more &quot; compact &quot; , except in the very last few seconds of the game where , after a big m@@ ess , the ball went very near the cro@@ s@@ spi@@ ece .
Sarkozy meets an@@ gr@@ y fishermen .
Before leaving for the United States , Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a trip to B@@ ritt@@ any .
Fac@@ ing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly distur@@ bed the access to several ports in B@@ ritt@@ any and Nor@@ mand@@ y , on Tuesday morning at Guil@@ vine@@ c port , in Fin@@ ist@@ ère , the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives .
The latter have promised to accept &quot; with a constructive spirit &quot; and they hope he &quot; will arrive with practical proposals &quot; .
A presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the &quot; crisis committee &quot; created by fishermen in B@@ ritt@@ any to come up with measures of addressing the so@@ aring prices of oil , which pe@@ aked at an average of more than 1.@@ 14 Euro per li@@ tre .
According to the Elys@@ ée spo@@ kes@@ man David Mar@@ tin@@ on , the president &quot; will discuss with them solutions that can be dev@@ ised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sail@@ ors &apos; remuner@@ ation &quot;
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen .
On Tuesday morning , they conducted slow driving operations in the Mor@@ b@@ ih@@ an and Cal@@ v@@ ados , causing traffic j@@ ams for almost 10 km .
The leisure craft harbour of Qui@@ ber@@ on was also blocked , but the roads to Bel@@ le-@@ Is@@ le were not blocked .
A fil@@ tering road@@ block was set up on the Qui@@ ber@@ on peninsula .
The sail@@ ors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning , since da@@ wn , ti@@ res and p@@ alle@@ ts in front of the fuel de@@ pots at the port of Bre@@ st and L@@ ori@@ ent , while demonstrations were taking place in Con@@ car@@ ne@@ au or Saint-@@ Bri@@ eu@@ c .
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel , such as S@@ ables d &apos;@@ O@@ lon@@ ne in V@@ end@@ ée , where tra@@ w@@ lers remained do@@ cked at the qu@@ ay@@ side or Le Hav@@ re , where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any mer@@ chant ships .
Fisher@@ men in La Tur@@ b@@ alle and Cro@@ i@@ sic , in Lo@@ i@@ re-@@ Atlan@@ tique , in the evening stopped the block@@ ade of the important Total refin@@ ery at Don@@ ges .
Those at Bou@@ log@@ ne-@@ sur@@ -@@ M@@ er have decided to wait until after the meeting at the mini@@ stry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions .
In Guil@@ vine@@ c , the &quot; crisis committee &quot; has to decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris .
But some Bre@@ ton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries , which did not support their movement .
&quot; The strike will continue &quot; because &quot; the fishermen will not give up &quot; and &quot; do not want to have to move onto Paris &quot; , for example , announced L@@ ili@@ ane C@@ ari@@ ou , president of the Fisheries Committee of L@@ ori@@ ent .
Professional fishermen , who pay no taxes on diesel , currently pay about 50 c@@ ents per li@@ tre but believe that the threshold of profit@@ ability for a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel prices less than 0.@@ 30 Euro per li@@ tre .

A@@ I@@ G would ce@@ de more than 15 % of its assets
The International American In@@ surance Group , that the U.S. monetary authorities have re@@ flo@@ ated , plans to sell more than 15 % of its assets to re@@ pay the $ 85 billion that were advanced to it , according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times .
A@@ I@@ G is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its pension business in the United States , said the newspaper quot@@ ing sources close to the case .
The administration board of A@@ I@@ G met on Sunday evening to consider possible c@@ ess@@ ations , according to the FT .
No confirmation could be obtained from A@@ I@@ G .
The assets which A@@ I@@ G plans to ce@@ de include its le@@ asing subsidiary Air International Le@@ ase Financial Cor@@ p@@ . , its participation of 59 % in the rein@@ su@@ red Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Hol@@ dings , and its property portfolio in addition to its private equity investments , the FT added .
No final decision has been taken on these dispos@@ als , the FT continued .
A@@ I@@ G must quickly find the funds to re@@ pay the loan of 85 billion that it has with the Federal Reserve or else risk seeing the U.S. authorities take 80 % of its shares , di@@ l@@ uting the proportion due to current shareholders .
Analy@@ sis Paris Histor@@ ical of the Meeting Mor@@ ning Histor@@ ic Mor@@ ning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange showed a historical fall on Monday after the rejection by the House of Represent@@ atives of the Pau@@ l@@ son plan to rescue the banks : the Do@@ w Jones lost 6.@@ 98 % , a loss never seen before approaching 800 points , and Nas@@ da@@ q 9.@@ 14 % .
The Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage ( D@@ J@@ IA ) fell by 7@@ 7@@ 7.@@ 68 points to 10@@ 36@@ 5.@@ 45 points .
In terms of points , the biggest drop in its history ( 68@@ 4.@@ 81 points ) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001 , the day of the resu@@ mption of trade after the terrorist attacks of S@@ ept . 11 .
The Nas@@ da@@ q index , mainly technological , has lost 199@@ .@@ 61 points to 198@@ 3.@@ 73 and the expanded Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s 500 index 8.@@ 81 % ( or 10@@ 6.@@ 85 points ) to 1@@ 10@@ 6.@@ 55 points , according to final closing figures .
Already suffering a depression at the beginning of the meeting , Wall Street went down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Represent@@ atives of the rescue plan for banks that was to in@@ ject some stability in the markets .
With 2@@ 28 votes against and 20@@ 5 for , the deleg@@ ates have refused to Treas@@ ury Secretary Henry Pau@@ l@@ son the resources he asked for .
N@@ early two out of three Republi@@ cans rejected his plan .
&quot; This is a bad signal for the market , which saw the Congress failing to adopt a plan , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey Pie@@ g@@ ż@@ a of FT@@ N Financial .
&quot; This shows how much the market re@@ lied on this plan , &quot; she added , f@@ ear@@ ing that a draft adopted in several days time can be &quot; too late &quot; .
&quot; If the project is effectively dead ( ... ) then the rela@@ y will be quickly passed to the Fed ( i.e. the U.S. central bank ) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tigh@@ ten the credit conditions &quot; , predic@@ ted Bri@@ an Be@@ th@@ une , chief econom@@ ist at Global In@@ sight .
And further acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ating the sense of urgency , &quot; each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution &quot; in the United States , emphasised Mrs Pie@@ g@@ ż@@ a .
After the bank@@ rupt@@ cy of Washington Mut@@ ual on Friday , the authorities have organized the ta@@ ke@@ over of Wach@@ o@@ via &apos;s banking activities by its ri@@ val C@@ iti@@ group .
In Europe , the crisis has acceler@@ ated shar@@ ply , pushing for emergency interventions by banks in the United Kingdom , Ben@@ el@@ ux , Iceland and Germany , a sign that the markets face &quot; not only a crisis in U.S. , but a global crisis &quot; , added the analy@@ st from FT@@ N Financial .
The bond market has clim@@ bed shar@@ ply .
The performance of 10-@@ year Treas@@ ury bond fell to 3.@@ 6@@ 32 % , against 3.@@ 8@@ 27 % on Friday evening , and the 30-@@ year bond to 4.@@ 16@@ 1 % , against 4.@@ 3@@ 57 % on the previous day .
Obama , who won on points the first tel@@ ev@@ ised du@@ el
To the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who , John Mc@@ C@@ ain or Barack Obama , won .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the campaign headquarters of the Republi@@ cans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the tel@@ ev@@ ised du@@ el which was wat@@ ched by a third of American families .
The political analy@@ st David Ger@@ gen believes that John Mc@@ C@@ ain &apos;s performance , though admi@@ rable , was not &quot; brilliant &quot; enough to enable it to reverse its decline in the p@@ olls five weeks from the presidential election .
The Gall@@ up , whose opinion pol@@ l published on Saturday gives a five points lead to Obama ( 49 % against 44 % for Mc@@ C@@ ain ) , judges that the Democrats have pul@@ led their own on Thursday .
According to a C@@ BS pol@@ l , among the un@@ decided voters , who are those that count , Obama has won 39 % of respon@@ dents , while 25 % of them give victory to Mc@@ C@@ ain .
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate , Joseph Bi@@ den , during the first and only public debate with his ri@@ val , Sar@@ ah P@@ alin .
&quot; It would be a mistake to under@@ estimate her .
She has good inst@@ inc@@ ts nonetheless &quot; , warned Bill Clinton this weekend .
The sep@@ tu@@ agen@@ arian Mc@@ C@@ ain has repeatedly put forward his un@@ question@@ able experience in foreign policy , while stres@@ sing the &quot; nai@@ v@@ ety &quot; of his oppon@@ ent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face debate .
&quot; Sen@@ ator Obama does not seem to understand that ... &quot; he accused several times .
&quot; I do not believe that Sen@@ ator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president , &quot; he also assured .
An angle of attack ham@@ mer@@ ed yesterday in Republi@@ can television adverti@@ sements .
Obama , himself , has stressed that he represented the future .
Without dis@@ assemb@@ ling , he was conc@@ ise and precise .
He put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world .
&quot; Mc@@ C@@ ain has never understood , while Obama , if &quot; , argued this weekend , a Democratic spot critici@@ zing the Republi@@ can of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the &quot; American on the streets &quot; .
&quot; During the n@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ ten minute debate , John Mc@@ C@@ ain had much to say about me , but nothing about you , Obama den@@ ounced yesterday to 20 000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carol@@ ina in the p@@ ouring rain .
He did not even utter the words &quot; middle class &quot; or &quot; workers &quot; . &quot; The financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to Obama , who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the br@@ ink of a pre@@ cip@@ ice .
&quot; The coming week could be a turning point &quot; , estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Sen@@ ator Charles Schum@@ er .
The Democratic representative Rah@@ m E@@ manu@@ el , an al@@ um@@ n@@ us of the Clinton administration , compared the &quot; good economic inst@@ inc@@ ts &quot; of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis .
For the Democratic candidate , the current crisis &quot; is the final verdi@@ ct of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Sen@@ ator Mc@@ C@@ ain &quot; .
Re@@ affir@@ ming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95 % of the Americans despite the tur@@ mo@@ il on Wall Street , the sen@@ ator from Il@@ lin@@ ois also reported that the achievement of the country &apos;s energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority , together with the establishment of a system of health insurance .
Mc@@ C@@ ain , he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 20@@ 30 .
Cau@@ tious , both candidates have do@@ dged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars ( 4@@ 70 billion Euro ) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely un@@ popular .
In Min@@ sk , &quot; have you noticed that there was an election , have you ? &quot;
Young people and other opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belar@@ u@@ sian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation .
A few hundred Belar@@ usi@@ ans gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of poll@@ ing stations in the central square of Min@@ sk to protest against the frau@@ dul@@ ent elections .
While no results have as yet been announced , many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko : &quot; the dict@@ ator , re@@ sign@@ ation . &quot;
Some conf@@ ess to not having even voted : &quot; What for , since they will do whatever they want of my voice , &quot; said a youth .
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn .
The sanctions , which include visa b@@ ans for 40 Belar@@ u@@ sian officials and the free@@ zing of assets , could be li@@ fted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers .
They have not been according to the opposition .
&quot; We were kept away from the electoral c@@ ommis@@ sions and our observers were unable to participate in the count , &quot; l@@ ament@@ ed Y@@ ur@@ i Po@@ tem@@ kin , the spo@@ kes@@ person for the Union of Democratic For@@ ces , a hetero@@ gene@@ ous group@@ ing of twelve parties .
&quot; It &apos;s a cosmetic change , emphasi@@ zes Alexander Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch , a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro@@ -European movement , because it &apos;s who counts the votes that is important , and here , that is the executive power .
If opposition members enter parliament , it is because they have been appointed , not elected .
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television , meetings in the regions , and proposed laws . &quot;
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because &quot; we must open a dialogue with the European Union .
Because if our economy which is heavily in debt with Russia , enters into a crisis , and if we do not reform ourselves , we risk becoming a protec@@ torate of Russia .
We want to be independent &quot; .
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which monitored the electoral process , does not recognize the validity of the bal@@ lot .
She stressed that the participation figures seem too high , and that the spread in vot@@ er turn@@ out ( 26 % of voters in Min@@ sk ) has opened the vote to all sorts of manipul@@ ations .
&quot; Have you noticed that there was an election , have you ? Qu@@ eries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Ko@@ zu@@ lin , one of two political prisoners released in August this year .
There was nobody at the voting offices .
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament , those who are most convenient to those in power . &quot;
The silence of the night falls on October Square .
On television , President Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko and members of the Central Ele@@ ction Committee welcomed their success .
The interview - B@@ lood becomes safe again
H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation , and its president , Dr. Franc@@ ine Dé@@ c@@ ary , had reason to re@@ jo@@ ice , because H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Que@@ bec has become one of the saf@@ est and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world .
And most importantly , it has reg@@ a@@ ined the confidence of the public who had been seriously sha@@ ken by the tain@@ ted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s .
As we know , national reserves managed by the blood trans@@ fusion service of the Canadian Red Cross had been infected by human imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus ( HIV ) and h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis C during the 1980s .
Fac@@ ed with this tragedy and public dis@@ content , the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry , headed by Justice Hor@@ ace Kre@@ ver , which aimed at sh@@ ed@@ ding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again .
While Ju@@ dge Kre@@ ver delayed in fil@@ ing his report , some provin@@ ces set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada .
In Que@@ bec , the committee G@@ é@@ lin@@ eau has fulfilled that mandate .
In the wake of the G@@ é@@ lin@@ eau and Kre@@ ver reports , two suppliers were created in Canada : H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec to serve Que@@ bec and Canadian B@@ lood Supp@@ ly for all other provin@@ ces and the two territories .
&quot; In 1998 , when H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec began operations , only 38 % of people still had confidence in the blood system in Que@@ bec , re@@ members Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary .
The situation was discou@@ ra@@ ging .
By d@@ int of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed , we have reg@@ a@@ ined the confidence of the public &quot; , she says before prou@@ dly affir@@ ming that at the beginning of 2008 , nearly 94 % of Que@@ bec &apos;s population now had confidence in H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec .
Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary , nonetheless , thinks &quot; confidence is something extremely fragile &quot; .
From its inc@@ eption on the 28 September 1998 , H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec has applied the precautionary principle .
At that time , there were in Europe with the out@@ break of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease , a new vari@@ ant of the Cre@@ utz@@ fel@@ d@@ t-@@ Jak@@ ob disease , said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998 .
&quot; And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood .
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Kre@@ ver and G@@ é@@ lin@@ eau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result , in this case Cre@@ utz@@ fel@@ d@@ t-@@ Jak@@ ob disease which is characterized by a de@@ generation of the brain leading inevitably to death , one establishes an excluding action .
In April 1999 , the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused .
But a few years ago , it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood .
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense . &quot;
In 1999 , on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing : the nu@@ c@@ lei@@ c acid testing ( N@@ AT ) allowed to detect directly in don@@ ated blood the virus itself rather than anti@@ bodies against the virus , which is what previous tests were based on .
The T@@ AN helped to shor@@ ten the silent period , which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques , the specialist explains .
It was able to reduce that period to less than a week .
Thus , it has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them .
These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood trans@@ fusion .
Today , a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contam@@ inated blood .
&quot; In other words , this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV .
Since H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Que@@ bec each year distri@@ butes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products , it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs .
I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescri@@ bing a blood trans@@ fusion to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate our health &quot; , affir@@ med the CEO of H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec .
&quot; Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products .
One never knows what disease will emerge in the system .
As recently as last year , there appeared on the island of Re@@ union the Chi@@ k@@ ung@@ unya virus which , like the West Ni@@ le virus , is transmitted by an in@@ sec@@ t in the blood .
We must be constantly vigil@@ ant , &quot; continues Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary before emphasi@@ zing that in addition to a secure supply , H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec must also provide them in sufficient quantities .
&quot; The demand is increasing as the population ages .
The treatments being more aggressive , patients often need to re@@ fill in red blood cells or plat@@ el@@ ets .
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3 % of Que@@ bec@@ ers eligible to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
Any healthy person , aged 18 and over fits the su@@ it@@ ability criteria to give blood every 56 days , six times a year .
On average , 14 % of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or mal@@ aria , for example , and if they have trav@@ elled in a country where mal@@ aria is ri@@ fe , they would be excluded for a period of one year .
&quot; With these 3 % , we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals .
The shor@@ tages are very rare .
But we must rene@@ w the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot don@@ ate their blood .
It is difficult to convince people to don@@ ate their blood , but even more so to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors .
Life today runs so fast , there is rarely time to find an hour to don@@ ate one &apos;s blood &quot; , says Franc@@ ine Dé@@ c@@ ary mis@@ er@@ ably .
With an annual budget of $ 2@@ 97 million , H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec provides not only blood products , but also tissu@@ es , including bone gra@@ fts , heart val@@ ves , ey@@ eb@@ alls and skin that is almost exclusively used for large bur@@ ns .
These tissu@@ es are analy@@ zed , processed and frozen before being stored at H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec , which manages also the only bank of plac@@ ental blood in Que@@ bec .
The um@@ bili@@ cal cor@@ d that was once regarded as biom@@ edi@@ cal waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leu@@ ka@@ em@@ ia .
&quot; A few weeks ago , we celebrated the banking of the thous@@ and@@ th sample of plac@@ ental cor@@ d blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year .
We should start to propose transplan@@ ts at the beginning of next year , &quot; says Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary descri@@ bing this program for collecting plac@@ ental cor@@ d blood as very popular .
&quot; Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it &quot; because H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Que@@ bec .
So@@ ccer - Imp@@ act in the semi-@@ fin@@ als
The Montreal Imp@@ act has qualified for the semi-@@ final round of the play@@ off@@ s for the first division of US@@ L , thanks to a 3-@@ 1 victory ( 4-@@ 3 in total goals ) at the expense of the Seattle So@@ under@@ s , yesterday , during the second and decisive game of the series quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als on total goals at the S@@ ap@@ u@@ to Stadium .
The mid@@ fiel@@ der Antonio Ri@@ bei@@ ro sco@@ red the decisive goal in the 90@@ th minute on Thursday .
After a first half with nothing but aim@@ lessly going from one side to another , mid@@ fiel@@ der David Test@@ o and Ro@@ cco Plan@@ cent@@ ino marked the net of the Montreal formation .
Ro@@ ger Lev@@ es@@ que was the only one to beat Mat@@ t Jordan for the So@@ under@@ s .
Rec@@ all that during the first game of the series rounds , on Friday , the Imp@@ act suffered a 2-@@ 1 defeat at the Star@@ fire Comple@@ x in Tu@@ k@@ wi@@ la , a sub@@ ur@@ b of Seattle .
The Imp@@ acts will have to measure up to the Vancouver Whit@@ ec@@ aps in the semi-@@ final .
Saturday night at M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota , Th@@ under filled a 3-@@ 1 deficit in the return match to win 4-@@ 3 , but Whit@@ ec@@ aps nevertheless acc@@ eded to the semi-@@ final round 5-@@ 4 on total goals .
Imp@@ act will face the Whit@@ ec@@ aps on Friday and Sunday , but the details of the series will be confirmed today .
In brief – Ko@@ val@@ e@@ v &apos;s vic@@ t@@ orious aim
The Canadian number one tri@@ o is ready for the season .
The unit consisting of Ale@@ x Ko@@ val@@ e@@ v , T@@ omas Ple@@ kan@@ ec and An@@ drei Ko@@ sti@@ ts@@ yn led the attack for a Canadian win of 3-@@ 2 in a sho@@ ot@@ out against the Florida Pan@@ thers last night at the B@@ ell Centre .
Ko@@ sti@@ ts@@ yn , the star of the first meeting , sco@@ red a goal , Ple@@ kan@@ ec has raised two ai@@ des , and Ko@@ val@@ e@@ v has collected a pass in this win , the Hab@@ s &apos; fourth in six preparatory games .
Ko@@ val@@ e@@ v gained the victory by sc@@ oring the only goal of the sho@@ ot@@ out .
&quot; I am not yet ready , warned the Russian .
I need another match to feel at ease . &quot;
&quot; He tried to do too much in the first period , Gu@@ y Car@@ bon@@ ne@@ au noted .
But I think he appreciated the way the match ended .
He had a nice ov@@ ation . &quot;
Cha@@ rest placed on the North
The prime minister does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished , Jean Cha@@ rest yesterday visited Jean-@@ Tal@@ on , Que@@ bec City , where the new health minister , Y@@ ves Bol@@ du@@ c ( left ) is trying to get elected in the by-@@ election today .
&quot; P@@ us@@ hing the limits of our last great northern fron@@ tier &quot; : this is the long-term ambition that Jean Cha@@ rest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Que@@ bec , in Lev@@ is yesterday .
Beh@@ ind him , during his speech , a kind of mill of images was projec@@ ted .
Rot@@ ating in a loop on three huge screens , were dramatic pictures of hydro@@ electric dam@@ s , mining developments , of Que@@ bec seen through &quot; Google M@@ aps &quot; , maps , etc .
Like the mass media during elections .
Moreover , as a point to emphasise , the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this fall , although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy .
The &quot; North Plan &quot; is the fourth part of a &quot; vision &quot; that the prime minister claims to have for Que@@ bec , that of a &quot; new economic space &quot; , which includes an agreement on labour with France , an agreement between Canada and Europe , and agreements with On@@ tari@@ o .
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently , the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 4@@ 9th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation .
The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was &quot; a je@@ wel with an immense potential &quot; , but never given its due chance , investment money , or specific priority in future projects .
At most , a few aven@@ ues that could be further developed : including hydro@@ power , the forest , but most of the entire mining sector , boo@@ sted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure .
The North contains &quot; nick@@ el , zin@@ c , copper , plat@@ in@@ um , gold , silver , iron , ti@@ tan@@ ium , and even diam@@ onds &quot; , according to Mr. Cha@@ rest &apos;s list .
This territory is twice the size of France &quot; , &quot; it is here with us , it is in Que@@ bec .
Not only is it with us , but it &apos;s also us &quot; , he insi@@ sted , to better show this he so@@ lic@@ ited a national founding my@@ th .
The province has built much by its relationship with the North , he said : the gold rus@@ h in Ab@@ iti@@ bi , Que@@ bec engineering , James &apos;s Bay .
&quot; We , our future , &quot; he added after a theat@@ rical pause con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating the immense map behind him .
The North , 70 % of Que@@ bec , includes a portion of Lab@@ rad@@ or that Que@@ bec has always claimed &quot; , said the Prime Minister at the press brie@@ fing .
&quot; This is a traditional position that all governments have reiter@@ ated .
There is a border along which there has been no agreement for too long a time and , when the opportunity arises , I reiterate this position there on behalf of government &quot; , he said .
Moreover , &quot; with the climate changes , we must re@@ think our vision of the North &quot; , he declared , referring to the Nor@@ thwest Pas@@ sage , to be held open throughout the year due to mel@@ ting ice .
In this new geo@@ political context , the Prime Minister considers occup@@ ying the territory a duty .
And the inhabitants of the territory , First Nations and In@@ u@@ it ?
The Prime Minister said that the Que@@ bec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would benefit them , especially to young people .
Two former ministers from two different parties , Pierre Cor@@ bei@@ l and Michel L@@ é@@ tour@@ ne@@ au ( former member Un@@ g@@ ava P@@ Q ) , have already started consultations with thirty communities .
An inter-@@ ministeri@@ al committee ch@@ ai@@ red by Ben@@ o@@ it Pel@@ le@@ tier , in which Ju@@ lie Bou@@ let ( Transport and Natural Res@@ ources ) has an important place , started work .
The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting , &quot; not necessarily a summit , &quot; but a time when &quot; we give ourselves a common vision . &quot;
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development .
The North will be &quot; coordinated , or@@ derly and respec@@ tful of the environment &quot; , he promised .
Jean Cha@@ rest described this &quot; vision &quot; as continuous with that of the Liberal prime minister who prec@@ eded him .
&quot; As the Liberals who have prec@@ eded us , we have altern@@ atively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development . &quot;
This has been one of the recur@@ ring themes of the weekend , which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50@@ th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Les@@ age at the head of the party .
One of the resolutions proposed to ren@@ ame the Central Beau@@ har@@ no@@ is D@@ am in Ad@@ é@@ lar@@ d-@@ Go@@ d@@ b@@ out .
&quot; From Go@@ d@@ b@@ out , who created Hydro@@ -@@ Que@@ bec , to Les@@ age who made the Qu@@ iet Revolution and the nation@@ alization of hydro@@ electricity , to Bou@@ ra@@ ssa who made James Bay , our party has managed to forge the future &quot; , declared Jean Cha@@ rest .
In the press brie@@ fing , he invo@@ ked another reference , conservative as this , the program &quot; Ro@@ ads to the North &quot; by John Die@@ fen@@ bak@@ er , prime minister from 1957 to 1963 .
Ad@@ dres@@ sing the proposed hydro@@ electric dam of E@@ ast@@ main@@ 1@@ a-@@ R@@ up@@ er , Mr. Cha@@ rest has stressed that it should become operational for 2012 .
&quot; Between us , but I plan to be there , &quot; he told activists , e@@ lic@@ iting from them a huge round of ap@@ plause .
Indeed , the Prime Minister , who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009 , has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall , it is what the law permits him .
He stressed that his schedule is filled up , notably by a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Que@@ bec@@ -@@ New York summit .
The weekend &apos;s General Council provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nation@@ alists resolutions , notably some &quot; constitutional aspirations &quot; which passed through like a bree@@ ze : the PL@@ Q in particular calls for the recognition of the &quot; specific@@ ity of Que@@ bec in the Constitution .
It also wants Que@@ bec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telec@@ omm@@ unications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Que@@ bec .
On the opposition side , the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scep@@ ticism .
The P@@ Q leader , Pau@@ line Mar@@ ois , has brought up again the policy development of Northern Que@@ bec that the Land@@ ry government had launched in 2001 .
According to her , the Liberal government , when it came into power in 2003 , had wai@@ ved the application .
H@@ ad it done so , &quot; it would be more advanced today , &quot; comm@@ ented M@@ s. Mar@@ ois alongside her candidate in Jean-@@ Tal@@ on ( bal@@ lot which takes place today ) , Franç@@ o@@ ise Mercure .
The AD@@ Q has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government .
&quot; But what is desired , is that it is not just for show &quot; , said the leader S@@ é@@ bas@@ tien Pro@@ ul@@ x , replacing Mario D@@ um@@ ont , who returned from vacation today .
Let@@ ters - A country dish@@ on@@ oured
It is Mr. V@@ ic To@@ e@@ ws , former Minister of Justice &quot; ( o@@ h ir@@ ony ) in the Har@@ per cab@@ inet , which allowed himself last summer to say that Lou@@ ise Ar@@ bor was a &quot; shame &quot; for Canada .
Thus casting op@@ pro@@ bri@@ um on the woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admi@@ ration also speaks volumes about the ent@@ ou@@ rage of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Har@@ per himself .
Here , we have before us a government that is the only one among all western countries involved , not to have re@@ patri@@ ated its nationals locked in the concentration camp at Guant@@ an@@ amo .
A government which igno@@ res the fact that O@@ mar K@@ ha@@ d@@ r was a young teen@@ ager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged .
The only government that , despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention , has gone back on his word and let langu@@ ish in in@@ humane conditions a child soldi@@ er .
The only one that reli@@ es on a trav@@ est@@ y of justice to assess the gu@@ ilt of the accused .
Remember , for the record , that UN@@ ICE@@ F , Am@@ nesty International and the Canadian Bar Association , among others , ple@@ aded for the re@@ patri@@ ation of O@@ mar K@@ ha@@ d@@ r so that he receives a fair trial in Canada .
This same government turns a blind eye to torture : little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psych@@ ologically destroyed , doub@@ t@@ lessly forever , after so many years of abuses .
One does not yet realise , but we are witn@@ essing right now a cre@@ eping ero@@ sion of our rights , of our liber@@ ties , and our &quot; democracy &quot; , this word that Har@@ per continues to bran@@ dish and that sounds hol@@ low in his mouth .
Now comes the time when there are no more mor@@ als : one can bul@@ ly , torture , arbitr@@ arily de@@ tain a Canadian citizen at the whi@@ m of the head of a minor government so far ( so what will happen so after 14 October ... ) .
A number of voters believe they will find sal@@ vation in a party that advocates Virtu@@ e , Law , and Order : they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country .
Sh@@ ame , Mr. To@@ e@@ ws , it is here , in this ren@@ unci@@ ation , and not elsewhere .
Free opinion - The Or@@ wel@@ lian speech Barri@@ ck Gold
In its September 17 edition , Le De@@ voir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Gar@@ ver , executive vic@@ e-@@ president of the Canadian mining Barri@@ ck Gold .
Following an Or@@ wel@@ lian logic , it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a de@@ fam@@ ation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a p@@ enny in order to launch a &quot; transparent public debate &quot; .
While it is true that the judges are independent and im@@ partial , especially in the cases of de@@ fam@@ ation , they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law .
Not surpris@@ ingly , this difference is completely obs@@ cu@@ red by Mr. Gar@@ ver .
Since , for Barri@@ ck Gold , the best way for it to conduct a public debate is to ru@@ in anyone who da@@ res to support a contrary position ?
Regar@@ dless of the trial &apos;s outcome , the authors and publi@@ sher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight , with very un@@ equal resources , against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bot@@ tom@@ less po@@ ckets of mining .
The tac@@ tics , in these un@@ equal stru@@ gg@@ les , is often to ru@@ in the defen@@ dants with the aim of imposing a settlement that sil@@ ences the opposition and in addition fri@@ gh@@ tens anyone who da@@ res to think of re@@ opening the issue .
If Barri@@ ck Gold really wanted a public debate , it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to what is done in several countries where Barri@@ ck Gold operates , the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not of bat@@ on th@@ umps .
Thus , it would have been sufficient for the mining company to open its books , records and establish a real debate , through newspapers , the media , publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue .
But Barri@@ ck Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand peti@@ tions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada .
Perhaps Mr Gar@@ ver could explain how he can both call for a &quot; public &quot; debate while at the same time dis@@ regarding the views of that very same audience ?
In the world of the Vice-President , it seems that this word refers only to high priced lawyers and not to all Canadi@@ ans : that is a rather narrow view of the concept .
In a democracy , even the critics have the right to speak .
What Barri@@ ck Gold does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writers and publi@@ shers of Black Canada , does so primarily because it re@@ jects its brutal mining methods .
The public is ready to hear Barri@@ ck and judge , but on the basis of a civili@@ zed exchange of arguments , and not as part of what many perc@@ eive as a prosec@@ u@@ tion-@@ ga@@ g ( continuing the &quot; public debate &quot; , Barri@@ ck Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ... ) .
Beyond the Mr. Gar@@ ver &apos;s sur@@ real speech , the continuation of Barri@@ ck Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth , essential for any democratic society .
It den@@ ies , collec@@ tively , the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpre@@ tations , which represents the very basis of intellectual work .
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects un@@ pal@@ at@@ able to the weal@@ thy corporations in the world in a country like Canada , under penalty of repeated prosec@@ ution , who can do it ?
If Barri@@ ck Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate , it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada .
She has a right to reply .
The ac@@ ade@@ mia , to which we belong , has long been managing the debates and dis@@ agreements , and resolving conflicts .
Barri@@ ck Gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that , contrary to its claims , it did not want a transparent debate .
It is a loss for ac@@ ade@@ mia , as well as for public debate in Canada , and it is time that governments put in place devices that limit such fri@@ vol@@ ous practices .
Operation Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republi@@ cans agree
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress , both the Republi@@ cans and the Democrats , finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30@@ s .
The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollars plan to cur@@ b the financial crisis that ro@@ cked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress .
In particular , it fore@@ sees : a better control by elected officials of its implementation , new mechanisms to ensure re@@ payment of public money committed , new provisions to limit the number of houses sei@@ zed for non-@@ payment , as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to exec@@ u@@ tives of companies rescu@@ ed .
U.S. Treas@@ ury Secretary , Henry Pau@@ l@@ son , the chairman of the House of Represent@@ atives , N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si , and Republi@@ can representative to the negotiating table , Sen@@ ator Ju@@ d@@ d Greg@@ g , announced the good news a few minutes after mid@@ night yesterday , following a mar@@ athon two-@@ day negotiations .
&quot; We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market , &quot; declared the representative of the Bush administration , Henry Pau@@ l@@ son .
&quot; Everything has been done in order to shi@@ eld the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street , &quot; said the Democra@@ t .
&quot; This is the fundamental point : if we do not do this , the trau@@ ma , chaos and dis@@ ruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense , &quot; declared Republi@@ can Ju@@ d@@ d Greg@@ g .
The negotiations turned into a sprin@@ t in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors .
The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning .
Associ@@ ated late to the negotiations , the two American presidential candidates were rather suppor@@ tive to the agreement , without failing , however , to express their dis@@ satisfaction that one is comp@@ elled to reach this extreme .
Democratic Sen@@ ator Barack Obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement , particularly those that enable owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescu@@ ed by the state .
&quot; When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the ir@@ responsibility of some , there is nothing to congratulate .
But these measures are necessary , &quot; he comm@@ ented on the air@@ waves of American television .
A@@ sk@@ ed by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan , his Republi@@ can oppon@@ ent , John Mc@@ C@@ ain , responded : &quot; I would like to see the details , but I hope so . &quot;
&quot; The outline that I read &#91; show &#93; that this is something we will all have to di@@ gest and with which we can go for@@ wards .
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable &quot; , he said .
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts , assets at risk and un@@ s@@ ell@@ able U.S. financial institutions .
It comes after a 14 month crisis trig@@ gered by the bur@@ sting of a housing bub@@ ble which first led to the collapse of ris@@ ky mort@@ g@@ ages ( sub@@ prime ) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles ( P@@ CA@@ A ) and leading to a free@@ ze of liquidity and the stam@@ pe@@ de of banks and financial institutions .
This is a group of elected Republi@@ cans who had der@@ ailed the first draft agreement last week .
It is believed to have come out of this im@@ pas@@ se ever since the Democrats have agreed that certain &quot; toxic &quot; shares of companies in difficulty are only insu@@ red by the government , rather than purchased .
To round off the cor@@ ners for everyone in Congress , a provision has also been added stipul@@ ating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program , it could introduce new taxes to help recover its investment .
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tran@@ che of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the President de@@ ems necessary .
The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress .
In exchange for its support , Washington will get st@@ akes in the companies it has rescu@@ ed , earning divi@@ den@@ ds in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed .
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the sei@@ z@@ ure of housing attached to mort@@ gage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and sever@@ ance packages paid to exec@@ u@@ tives of companies affected .
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Represent@@ atives today , and the Sen@@ ate on Wednesday .
Despite all their efforts , it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light .
Vo@@ ices have indeed continued to be raised against the project yesterday , both in the Republi@@ can camp as well as by the Democrats .
&quot; Obviously , Washington does not hear you , &quot; said while addressing his constitu@@ ents the Republi@@ can Scott Gar@@ re@@ tt , a member of the Finance Committee of the House .
&quot; Yes , we have a serious financial problem .
Yes , solutions do exist .
But not ones that take advantage of taxpayers &quot; .
Le@@ ader of a small group in Congress du@@ b@@ bed &quot; the Sc@@ ep@@ tics &apos; Cau@@ cus &quot; , the Democratic representative Bra@@ d Sher@@ man presents things differently , but reaches the same conclusion .
&quot; Four hundred prominent prof@@ essors of economics , including three Nobel Prize winners , have written to tell us : one asks the Congress not to hur@@ ry and to examine carefully the way forward &quot; , he said yesterday .
At the same time , Europe has once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis .
After an emergency meeting , the three Ben@@ el@@ ux countries have announced the partial nation@@ alization of the banking group For@@ tis for 11.@@ 2 billion Euro ( 16.@@ 3 billion U.S. ) .
The intervention of the governments of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ bas has indicated that it would ren@@ ounce acqu@@ iring its ri@@ val in full bank@@ rupt@@ cy since it has lost 2 billion Euro ( 2.@@ 9 billion U.S. ) in the ris@@ ky mort@@ g@@ ages crisis in the United States .
For@@ tis emplo@@ ys 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insur@@ ers .
&quot; This is not lost money , declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister , W@@ outer B@@ os .
In return , we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence .
It &apos;s just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead . &quot;
Meanwhile , across the Channel , the British government seems about to nation@@ alize another bank hit by the financial crisis .
According to the English press , the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Bra@@ d@@ ford and B@@ ing@@ ley , including more than 41 billion ( 7@@ 5.@@ 5 billion U.S. ) in real estate loans .
The Spanish bank Sant@@ ander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank .
The Bra@@ d@@ ford and B@@ ing@@ ley would be the second bank , after the Northern Rock , the British government will have to nation@@ alize since the beginning of this financial crisis .
Paul New@@ man ( 19@@ 25-@@ 2008 ) - De@@ ath of an true icon
His beauty and his blue eyes were for a long time his main asset , some would say his weakness .
Did he free himself from this nar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ stic mirror , this American actor with the charming s@@ mile ?
Yes and no .
His mo@@ dest@@ y , his sensitivity and an abund@@ ance of talent would have also distan@@ ced him from the power register which gives birth to real sac@@ red mon@@ sters .
But what a great run@@ ner till the end !
Paul New@@ man , who died on Friday , aged 83 , as a result of lung cancer at his ran@@ ch in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the years of sp@@ l@@ end@@ our .
L@@ ess monum@@ ental than Br@@ ando , who he res@@ emb@@ led and was a long time sort of ri@@ val on the screen , more cau@@ tious in his game , certainly more fragile , but also an a@@ post@@ le of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions .
Mi@@ xed blood children are often magnificent .
He was born in O@@ hi@@ o in 19@@ 25 , from a Jewish German father and a mother of Hungarian origin .
From these European roots were born the gl@@ orious faces of the American dream .
Without an excessive ego , the ultimate mark of quality .
Because in him is portra@@ yed a countr@@ y-@@ lo@@ ving self made man , a comb@@ at@@ ant in the Pacific War , wo@@ unded in combat , who in the early 50 &apos;s studied drama at Y@@ ale and attended the Ac@@ tor &apos;s Studio in New York , before tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ing at the theatre , on television , soon after at the cinema .
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ran@@ ked second in the 24 H@@ ours Le M@@ ans in 1979 , doub@@ led as a sex symbol , albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the ac@@ tress Jo@@ anne Woo@@ d@@ ward .
Also dis@@ appearing with him are the sha@@ dow@@ y areas of this secret star , discre@@ et , committed , all@@ ergi@@ c to the scand@@ als of show business , which have definitely not penet@@ rated the en@@ ig@@ ma .
An honest man in the no@@ bl@@ est sense of the word .
The dis@@ appearance of Paul New@@ man brought verti@@ go to mo@@ vie@@ go@@ ers this weekend , while his major roles col@@ li@@ de on the black screen of memories .
More than half a century of a sevent@@ h American art which is constantly changing sc@@ roll@@ s through him .
Rus@@ hing back into memory are the charming co@@ w@@ boy in But@@ ch Cas@@ sidy and the S@@ und@@ ance K@@ id ( 1969 ) , the young man rejec@@ ting his sen@@ su@@ al wife ( Eli@@ za@@ beth Ta@@ yl@@ or ) in The C@@ at on a Hot T@@ in Ro@@ of adapted from Tenn@@ es@@ see Willi@@ ams in 1958 .
C@@ loser to us ( 1990 ) , one e@@ vo@@ kes his sensitive Mr. Bridge , distur@@ bed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promises .
So many other Paul New@@ man have passed into history .
The bo@@ xer Ro@@ cky Gra@@ zi@@ ano , del@@ in@@ qu@@ ent , tor@@ mented , violent , unforgettable in Som@@ ebody Up There Li@@ kes Me ( marked by hat@@ red ) , Robert W@@ ise , a role dest@@ ined for James D@@ ean , taken after his death , which really launched New@@ man in 1956 .
This friendly cro@@ ok in the most brilliant The St@@ ing , O@@ scar for best film in 1973 .
Billi@@ ard player bitter and ven@@ ge@@ ful in the magnificent The Hu@@ st@@ ler by Robert Ro@@ ssen ( 1961 ) , he took up again the character on his return in The Color of Money by Martin S@@ cor@@ s@@ ese , who in 1987 won him his only O@@ scar with nine nom@@ inations .
This face throughout the ages , it was him .
H@@ im again .
Er@@ as jo@@ stle by through his journey .
Young people know him mainly through the cul@@ t of Sla@@ p Sho@@ t by George Ro@@ y Hill ( 1977 ) , as Reg@@ gie Dun@@ lo@@ p , the coach of an un@@ orthodo@@ x ice ho@@ ckey team .
His fans met him again in 1994 in The Hu@@ d@@ su@@ cker Pro@@ xy by the Co@@ en brothers .
With a last role as the go@@ d@@ father of an Irish ma@@ fia in Road to Per@@ dition by S@@ am Men@@ des in 2003 , the loop was closed .
Unlike several legen@@ ds of the cinema who have dropped the trade early , New@@ man has remained in the s@@ add@@ le for a long time , while den@@ oun@@ cing Hollywood , its gold , its sp@@ l@@ end@@ our and its concessions .
The French film@@ maker Ber@@ tr@@ and Ta@@ ver@@ nier considered him , not without hum@@ our , &quot; as a living challenge to &quot; under@@ playing &quot; jud@@ ging his performances too supported .
The profession has not always been easy with the beautiful Paul New@@ man to whom roles came for a long time easy as p@@ ie .
He played though less often , in his first young roles , margin@@ al characters : neuro@@ tics , alco@@ ho@@ lic@@ s , ba@@ star@@ ds or desper@@ ate men , with his perfect tra@@ its reflecting the exc@@ esses and the re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous .
As director , New@@ man revealed a little known aspect of his modest real sensitivity .
His R@@ ach@@ el , R@@ ach@@ el , in 1968 ( based on the novel by the Canadian Mar@@ gare@@ t Lau@@ rence ) , with his wife Jo@@ anne Woo@@ d@@ ward in the lead role , drew a fine female portra@@ it of mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y .
He lost his son Scott to an over@@ dose to whom he dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984 , out of dec@@ ency and s@@ ad@@ ness .
Among the rain of tri@@ butes that fell on New@@ man yesterday , his great friend and former compan@@ ion in arms Robert Red@@ ford ( they played together in The St@@ ing , and But@@ ch Cas@@ sidy and the S@@ und@@ ance K@@ id ) said , very s@@ ad@@ dened : &quot; His presence has made my life and this country better . &quot;
Gener@@ osity , love of life are the features of the vibrant actor just disappeared .
Beyond his legendary career , also er@@ ased was a great activ@@ ist for civil rights , ec@@ ology , the independent cinema , a prote@@ st@@ or against the exc@@ esses of Hollywood .
We saw his mu@@ g shots on a lot of j@@ ars of sal@@ ad dres@@ sing , sau@@ ces , bis@@ cu@@ its , and other foodstuffs , jud@@ ging the process fairly ta@@ st@@ eless , although a ga@@ g at the outset .
Prof@@ its from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty .
New@@ man , rather than sit on his my@@ th , has remained committed until the end .
He left his five dau@@ gh@@ ters a letter containing these words : &quot; Al@@ ways and to the end , your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortun@@ e .
It has been a privilege being there . &quot;
And a privilege for us to have followed the trail of such a lu@@ ci@@ d and generous American artist .
A model citizen , in sum and in addition .
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zu@@ schlag and his compan@@ ions ?
The conduct of the criminal prosec@@ ution of J@@ á@@ nos Zu@@ schlag and his compan@@ ions will be started on 8th October .
The politi@@ cian and his compan@@ ions have been accused of taking part continuously and on a professional basis in a fraud causing significant damages , as well as in other criminal activities , including for@@ gery .
According to the prosec@@ ution , they used the awarded tender funds for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by fa@@ ke invo@@ ices .
The state and municipal funds - H@@ U@@ F 65 million in total - have been shared between the organization Fi@@ at@@ al Bal@@ ol@@ dal and other people .
The methodology - which has been published by the investig@@ ating authority , too - was to use b@@ ills of costs with un@@ real performance in order to access the awarded tender funds . This way the associations never met the agreed undertakings .
Most of the invo@@ ices were false according to the indic@@ tment .
The invoice templates were acquired in the J@@ ó@@ z@@ se@@ f@@ vá@@ ros market and the round stamp@@ s were manufactured in Kis@@ kun@@ hal@@ as .
The selection of the companies in the name of which the b@@ ills were issued was completed on a trip in western Hungary , where J@@ á@@ nos Zu@@ schlag sent I@@ st@@ v@@ án Lad@@ os .
According to the testim@@ ony of the latter one , he was ordered to select pensions and restaurants .
He asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place , and based on this invoice they prepared the invo@@ ices to be submitted to the ten@@ ders called for by institutes such as the Ministry of Youth and Sports , the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municip@@ ality of Budapest .
These were submitted mainly by I@@ st@@ v@@ án Lad@@ os and his compan@@ ion , Andr@@ ás Ő@@ ri , who was responsible for writing the reports required to qualify for the support .
One of Lad@@ os &apos;s &quot; study visits &quot; was to a be@@ er-@@ house .
According to the invoice dated 2003 and issued by Zu@@ schlag and his compan@@ ions , the establishment provided food for a group of 90 people , who were members of the association B@@ iz@@ tos P@@ ont E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let .
However , as the director of the company states , the establishment does not even have the capacity to provide seats for such a great number of people .
The invoice submitted in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt - which was later ren@@ amed to E@@ gy@@ ü@@ tt a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ re@@ dé@@ rt - also contained several mistakes in its form and content .
The bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3-@@ room pension in Bad@@ ac@@ son@@ y@@ tom@@ a@@ j , which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people .
The imagin@@ ative f@@ ill@@ ers of the invo@@ ices went also too far when they indicated P@@ ig@@ al K@@ ft@@ . in the documents . It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accus@@ ation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt and H@@ opp@@ á .
Gy@@ ő@@ z@@ ő F@@ ark@@ as , director of the firm said to h@@ v@@ g@@ .@@ h@@ u that when he was sum@@ mon@@ ed and the invo@@ ices were shown to him , he recognised their false nature immediately .
&quot; The name and tax number of our company were placed incorrec@@ tly on the stam@@ p . &quot;
And he added that , moreover , the invoice had been issued for the accommodation of 100 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 11 rooms , which did not have the capacity for so many people .
In addition , the bill included catering as well , though their restaurant had not been in function for long .
The enthusiastic b@@ ill-@@ makers were not aware of the fact that the Budap@@ est@@ -based travel agency that they selected organiz@@ es foreign tours only , thus the indicated Hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coinci@@ de with the invoice issuing practice of the firm .
Furthermore , - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also indicated VAT on the document in spite of the fact that the transport activities to foreign countries other than the European Union were exemp@@ t from VAT .
The degree of VAT , which has been shown in four documents issued by Hotel Ré@@ v@@ fül@@ ö@@ p K@@ ft@@ . to the foundation J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt , was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 15 % , instead of the indicated 25 % . Additionally , the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machin@@ e-@@ made invo@@ ices , while the reviewed b@@ ills were manually prepared .
The invo@@ ic@@ e-@@ issu@@ ers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosec@@ ution procedure . This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting .
The fa@@ ke nature of the b@@ ills issued to E@@ gy@@ ü@@ tt a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ re@@ dé@@ rt A@@ lap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny , XX@@ I . Sz@@ á@@ z@@ adi Kultur@@ á@@ lis E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let and B@@ iz@@ tos P@@ ont was dis@@ closed due to formal devi@@ ations such as inappropriate b@@ illing format and for@@ ged stam@@ p .
Just like in the case of Rav@@ enna B@@ t@@ . or the Sport@@ camp of Kun@@ feh@@ ér@@ t@@ ó , the representatives of which denied having issued the b@@ ills .
The for@@ gers did not even pay attention to the fact that the Ny@@ í@@ reg@@ y@@ h@@ á@@ za based HI@@ B K@@ ft@@ . was under liqui@@ dation at the time ( 2001 ) when a group from Fi@@ at@@ al V@@ á@@ ro@@ sé@@ rt E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let alle@@ ge@@ dly had lunch there . The in@@ solven@@ cy practi@@ tion@@ er denied having issued the document .
Is@@ su@@ ed consci@@ ously
The other group of the invo@@ ic@@ e-@@ issu@@ ers consists of those having been aware of issuing fic@@ ti@@ tious invo@@ ices .
The foundation Es@@ é@@ ly Budap@@ est@@ é@@ rt A@@ lap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny issued an invoice of about four million for@@ ints for on the request of Fi@@ at@@ al Bal@@ ol@@ dal - I@@ f@@ j@@ ú S@@ zo@@ ci@@ ali@@ st@@ á@@ k . This invoice was issued to the foundation E@@ gy@@ ü@@ tt a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ re@@ dé@@ rt .
According to the indic@@ tment , the director of Col@@ la@@ b K@@ ft@@ . was encouraged by one of the defen@@ dants , Lu@@ do@@ vic Gy@@ ör@@ fi , to prepare a fic@@ ti@@ tious invoice .
Bio@@ gate K@@ ft . - which is currently under liqui@@ dation - also co@@ operated with Zu@@ schlag and his compan@@ ions . In 2003 the company provided the foundation J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt A@@ lap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny , the associations At@@ las@@ z E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let and V@@ ör@@ ös@@ fen@@ y@@ ő E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let with invo@@ ices of roughly H@@ U@@ F 5 million with no real economic activity behind .
There was no cash flow either since the issued invo@@ ices were vo@@ i@@ ded later , but the organizations for@@ got to indicate this in their documents .
The next category of the firms having issued the invo@@ ices are those being linked to the defen@@ dants .
A good example for this is I@@ v@@ án Kub@@ at@@ ov , the delivery representative of the Ukrainian executive director of Delta Tri@@ ó K@@ ft@@ . having its headquarters in Budapest , but not to be found there , which deals with fuel and vehicle trade .
In October , November and December the company issued several invo@@ ices for selling comp@@ uting devices , in a value of approximately H@@ U@@ F 18 million .
According to the data of the investigation , these b@@ ills were purchased by the Kis@@ kun@@ hal@@ as@@ -based Cash Investment K@@ ft . , which has been under liqui@@ dation since 14 September 2005 .
The executive director of the abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned company was a Romanian man , to whom I@@ v@@ án Kub@@ at@@ ov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005 .
According to our information , Kub@@ at@@ ov admitted having issued b@@ ills to At@@ las@@ z , H@@ opp@@ á and E@@ gy@@ ü@@ tt a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ re@@ dé@@ rt A@@ lap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny and received the amounts paid .
F@@ a-@@ Ban@@ i J@@ os Fa@@ i@@ par@@ i K@@ ft@@ . and Jo@@ s-@@ Investment B@@ t@@ . were founded by Romanian mas@@ ons , specifically at the request of I@@ v@@ án Kub@@ at@@ ov .
However , neither of these firms operated actually , which the def@@ end@@ ant explained by lack of orders .
Still , he could take advantage of these undertakings ; for his request , att@@ or@@ ney Z@@ sol@@ t Sz@@ ente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invo@@ ices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Zu@@ schlag , namely for At@@ las@@ z and Y@@ -@@ Gener@@ á@@ ci@@ ó .
Kub@@ at@@ ov provided 15 invo@@ ices for the organizations in the name of Cash Investment , Delta Tri@@ ó , F@@ a-@@ Ban@@ i J@@ os , J@@ os Investment and Lin@@ ax@@ trade , with a total value of H@@ U@@ F 14.@@ 2 million .
According to the prosec@@ ution , 10 % of the amount indicated on the invo@@ ices and the amount of VAT was the share of Kub@@ at@@ ov .
He even had S@@ zi@@ -@@ Ber@@ i B@@ t@@ . issue fic@@ ti@@ tious invo@@ ices which were used for the tender of B@@ iz@@ tos P@@ ont .
In January 2006 Y@@ -@@ Gener@@ á@@ ci@@ ó and S@@ zö@@ v@@ et@@ sé@@ g a Modern Mag@@ yar@@ or@@ sz@@ á@@ g@@ é@@ rt submitted a tender to T@@ án@@ c@@ si@@ cs M@@ ih@@ á@@ ly A@@ lap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny ( T@@ MA ) , which is a non-@@ profit organization of the socialist party .
They were awarded H@@ U@@ F 500@@ .000 each , but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender .
In order to avoid the fraud being dis@@ closed , they submitted the 5 fic@@ ti@@ tious invo@@ ices issued by Works Team K@@ ft@@ . to T@@ MA .
These invo@@ ices were found - during the sear@@ ches - in Á@@ r@@ p@@ á@@ d K@@ em@@ ec@@ sei &apos;s office located in the Ministry of Education .
Some defen@@ dants are likely to conf@@ ess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the att@@ or@@ ney &apos;s department , too .
The most interesting part of the situation could be J@@ á@@ nos Zu@@ schlag &apos;s decision on dis@@ closing his secre@@ ts .
His testim@@ ony so far is not very detailed , and though he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case , he has not done so .
The question is whether he is interested in fulfilling his promise or - in return for the reimbur@@ sement of most of the damage ( 50 million for@@ ints ) , the soci@@ alists have struck a deal with him and Zus@@ i would rather take the ra@@ p .
Or he might just have taken off@@ ence since his requests regarding the allevi@@ ation of the conditions of his detention - in other words his being placed under house arrest - kept falling upon dea@@ f ears .
While those who have committed the much more damaging and non-@@ compens@@ ated economic criminal activities can walk freely in the streets or wait at their home for the end of the legal procedure being conducted against them , he does not have the opportunity to do that .
The psych@@ ology of over@@ bi@@ d@@ ding : what do we spend more money on ?
At an auction , the customers tend to spend more money on a product and over@@ value it .
The neuro@@ log@@ ist and econom@@ ist researchers of New York University managed to dis@@ close the neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ cal@@ -@@ economic basis of this well-known - and seem@@ ingly ir@@ rational - behaviour .
According to their study published in the periodi@@ cal called Science , people don not want to lose in a competition like the auction of eBay , thus they rather pay an un@@ reali@@ stically high price .
The research aimed at ma@@ pping the neuro@@ logical scheme of this &quot; game &quot; with the help of experimental au@@ ctions .
A group of volunteers was playing lo@@ tter@@ y and another group was taking part in an auction . In the mean@@ while , the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic re@@ son@@ ance ima@@ ging ( f@@ M@@ RI ) .
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which over@@ bi@@ d@@ ding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called stri@@ atum , situated under the cer@@ eb@@ ral cor@@ tex , was coming into operation upon the person &apos;s defeat .
This area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays role in the &quot; self-@@ rewar@@ ding &quot; mechanism of the ner@@ vous system .
Thus , according to the researchers , raising the price can be explained by the avoid@@ ance of the violent reaction of the stri@@ atum .
In order to justify their theory , the econom@@ ist members of the research group conducted financial resear@@ ches as well .
In this research three groups were making bi@@ ds against someone , under various conditions .
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bi@@ ds .
Another group got a promise of receiving an extra amount of 15 dollars in case of their victory .
The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat , they would lose this amount .
As it seems , the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat .
Pro@@ ving the hy@@ pothe@@ sis of the neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts , the members of the group &quot; playing for not losing money &quot; were ready to make higher bi@@ ds than the control group or the group &quot; playing for gaining money &quot; .
&quot; These results cannot be de@@ duced from any existing economic theory .
The earlier the@@ ories explained the phenomenon experienced at au@@ ctions by the delight of victory and risk avoid@@ ance .
It was the neuro@@ logical ima@@ ging methods that helped us to dis@@ solve the contradiction between the two the@@ ories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end &quot; , said Andrew Schot@@ ter , professor of the economic fac@@ ul@@ ty of New York University .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis : when shall we turn to a doctor ?
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately half a billion people suffer from chronic h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis B or C infection . In Hungary , the chronic li@@ ver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mor@@ tali@@ ty .
Although the number of the Hung@@ arians being infected by h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis can reach 100 000 , only 7 000 of them are treated properly . The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis is a collective name of different infec@@ tious li@@ ver diseases caused by various viruses .
Even though there are simil@@ arities in the symptoms , e.g. li@@ ver infl@@ amm@@ ation or ja@@ un@@ dice , the nature of the pa@@ tho@@ gens and the caused diseases are different .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis viruses are transmitted in two main forms , depending on the type of the pa@@ tho@@ gens : h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A and E travel through the ali@@ mentary tract ( for example with infected food or water ) , h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis B , C , D and the other viruses are carried in blood and body flu@@ ids ( sem@@ en , v@@ ag@@ inal mu@@ cus , s@@ ali@@ va ) .
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vacc@@ ination ; but there is no vacc@@ ination against virus C .
The symptoms of h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having e@@ aten the contam@@ inated food ; they are accompanied by general mal@@ a@@ ise , weakness , ab@@ domin@@ al problems , nau@@ sea .
The next sign is ja@@ un@@ dice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye . Additional symptoms are : light coloured fa@@ eces , dark ur@@ ine . Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks .
An@@ nu@@ ally and worldwide , 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease , h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis B , causing li@@ ver cancer and cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver .
The main reason is that only an estimated one-@@ tent@@ h of the infected receive medical treatment .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis C can also lead to serious problems : it may result in cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver or li@@ ver cancer if it is not treated .
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness since the pa@@ tho@@ gens destroy the li@@ ver cells over a long time , thus in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later .
From this point , early prevention , especially regular screening tests have fundamental significance .
In three groups this illness is experienced highly above the average : among people having received blood trans@@ fusion before 1991 , dru@@ g-@@ ad@@ dic@@ ts and those having tat@@ to@@ os .
Currently , the number of people infected by chronic h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis C is around 200 million worldwide .
Since the disease can be recognized by routine laboratory testing , it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed .
In case of early recognition , the disease can be cu@@ red , the virus can be destroyed , thus infec@@ tivity ce@@ ases and the in@@ duction of cancer can be prevented .
30 September is the World H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis Day , which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected .
It aims to call attention to chronic li@@ ver infl@@ amm@@ ation caused by viruses , the causes of its in@@ duction and the significance of early recognition .
Does it hur@@ t less if you believe in God ?
According to a recent research , religious belief can be used as a kind of pain kil@@ ler , which could have e@@ ased the death of ca@@ tho@@ lic mar@@ ty@@ rs as well .
&quot; The scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of belie@@ ving in God on the degree of people &apos;s sensitivity to pain &quot; , says the British Tele@@ graph .
Within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 ca@@ tho@@ lic belie@@ vers and 12 ath@@ ei@@ sts were given electric shock . In the mean@@ while , all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary .
The results showed that the practi@@ sing Catho@@ lic@@ s were able to exclude most of their pain .
Due to the brain scann@@ ing technology , it turned out that the Catho@@ lic@@ s were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation .
This was the first experiment in a series of research , which besides ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ cians includes scientists , philosoph@@ ers , the@@ ologi@@ ans from different departments of the university .
To be exact , a spark@@ ing object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunteers in the experiment .
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings ; S@@ as@@ so@@ fer@@ rat@@ o &apos;s Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s Lady with an Er@@ mine from the 15th century .
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the belie@@ vers would enter a sort of religious state of mind . Da Vinci &apos;s painting was selected because of its similar style and cal@@ ming nature .
The volunteers spent half an hour in an M@@ RI scanner and received 20 electric sho@@ cks within four consec@@ utive time periods , while they were looking at one of the abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned paintings .
The Catho@@ lic@@ s described the situation as &quot; safe &quot; and &quot; protecting &quot; which made them &quot; relaxed and peaceful &quot; .
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - compar@@ ing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo &apos;s work .
According to psych@@ ologist Miguel F@@ ari@@ as , taking part in the experiment himself , similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having strong emotional influence on the certain person , even among ath@@ ei@@ sts . It is all about finding the right picture .
&quot; We should find a photo of someone who they feel very positive about , like a mother or a father &quot; , says the psych@@ ologist .
An@@ gli@@ can bis@@ hop Tom W@@ right welcomed the findings of the research .
&quot; Prac@@ ti@@ sing faith should change and often does change our personality &quot; , he added .
After these great results the question now is how Leonardo &apos;s or another highly appreciated pain@@ ter &apos;s picture of Mad@@ onna would influence the belie@@ vers &apos; pain regulation ?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results ?
You are what you share
On its 10th birthday Google can admit : it is there in the people &apos;s po@@ cket , as well as above their head , in the sky . Google knows where people go on vacation , what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in .
In spite of all that , Eric Schmi@@ dt , a key person of the company is still not satisfied .
On the other hand , the scep@@ tics who bring it in parallel with Or@@ well &apos;s d@@ read@@ ful fantas@@ y just cannot see the essence of web 2.0 .
Eric Schmi@@ dt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users . It is necessary to maintain the Google fo@@ under@@ s &apos; original aim , namely : &quot; to create a system for all the information of the world &quot; , he added .
According to the Goo@@ g@@ le-@@ chief , the company - after having sub@@ ver@@ ted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the information .
An@@ s@@ wer@@ ing the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like &quot; What shall I do tomorrow ? &quot; , or &quot; What type of jobs suit me best ? &quot; . However , software cannot give the right answers to these seem@@ ingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient .
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that the terms sear@@ ched by them are recorded , as well as the IP address used for the search and the pages visited by them afterwards .
Using the 2-@@ year-old Person@@ alized Search function , users can store their own surfing hist@@ ories , they can review what they were looking for , what kind of links they cli@@ cked on before . In the long term , it can provide the users with personalized findings . The function called Rec@@ omm@@ end@@ ations will be based on the same logic : it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier .
&quot; What happens if my personal data are used against me , if it is discovered what I do ? &quot; , ask some of the users worrying about the inform@@ ation-@@ monopoly of Google .
It is usually the degree of the potential power represented by the company that generates counter reaction in the users , not sense of gu@@ ilt , fear of punishment , desire for freedom or re@@ bel@@ lion against authority .
Nevertheless , it has been confirmed that all the sear@@ ched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to third parties . In such cases nothing protects the privacy of the Internet users .
The best example for that is the concer@@ ted action against some Brazilian pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les ; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages , called Or@@ k@@ ut . The data supplied helped the government identify several pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les .
The users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in May when Google - in association with the EE@@ F electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the F@@ B@@ I : the court confirmed that under no point of the Constitution can the F@@ B@@ I ob@@ lige Google to provide any kind of , secre@@ tly asked information .
( Nevertheless , - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 50 000 web addresses and 1 000 search terms . However , it could not acquire the individual users &apos; search lists , nor a complete list of web pages and key@@ words covering a two-@@ month period . )
As it seems , there are controversial opinions on Google . It is attacked by those who fear of giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be dimin@@ ished by using the services provided by Google . Thus , they rather represent the resi@@ sting group of conservative multinational companies .
Meanwhile , the American ge@@ ek culture and its wild o@@ at including enthusiastic computer fans , activists , users in several countries consider them as the next generation of large companies , a &quot; cool cor@@ poration &quot; , in contrast to their opinion about their ri@@ val , Microsoft , the cre@@ ator of Windows and the con@@ quer@@ or of the world , in spite of the fact that the two companies fight for the same goal .
One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications . Furthermore , the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - compar@@ ing to the official software giant &apos;s practice - looks more available , you@@ thful and cool .
Or maybe it is because of the fact that ge@@ eks can precisely see the problematic relation between personal privilege and Internet , which is in accordance with the most frequently discussed key expression of the last few years , web 2.0 .
Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to inten@@ tionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels . Though the degree of this act can be various , depending on the user , the main point is the same : we show ourselves to the world .
An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or X@@ an@@ ga , they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list maker last@@ .@@ f@@ m , then those can be connected to a tracking system such as Fri@@ end@@ Fe@@ ed or Bli@@ p.@@ f@@ m. In addition , users can create blo@@ gs that automatically update the recently up@@ loaded photo galleries stored on Fli@@ ck@@ r or Pic@@ asa .
We can read about several stories like this : the girl - checking the plenty of photos up@@ loaded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy boy@@ friend spent his previous night . Or another one : an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blog . One consequence can be definitely drawn : the definition of privacy has been re@@ valued .
If someone lives an online life , they are what they show of themselves - this is the basic concept behind the behaviour of today &apos;s youth .
If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to b@@ yp@@ ass Google &apos;s monopoly , it is also possible ( e.g. using S@@ cro@@ o@@ gle , which also applies the Google search system but pur@@ pos@@ ely leaves no trace behind ) .
The number of those inten@@ tionally not regi@@ stering to social networking sites is significant . This way they can avoid being discovered , Google &apos;s online applications from text editor to image manager and news@@ reader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever .
General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google .
The company - with its value of USD 15@@ 6 billion - is worth more than IBM ( USD 140 billion ) , Intel ( USD 12@@ 4 billion ) or Co@@ c@@ a-@@ Col@@ a ( USD 110 billion ) . In addition , the advertising spaces of Ad@@ Wor@@ ds / Ad@@ Sen@@ se threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-@@ increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious head@@ ache .
Nevertheless , critics can also find the distur@@ bing counter@@ points : the management completely rejected the employees &apos; objec@@ tion , which bur@@ st out because the fee of the company &apos;s kinder@@ garten had been doub@@ led . The daily can@@ teen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management . However , all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google bo@@ wed before the Chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has fil@@ tered all search results that off@@ end good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime .
One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be adverti@@ sed in advance , only when they are ready to be used . Still , the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world : some people predi@@ ct that the book and magazine scann@@ ing and archi@@ ving project of Google will soon reach such propor@@ tions that it will have to face the Supreme Court . Others have fear of the Health system , which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us , including our previous medical findings , physi@@ cians and problems .
Finally , the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci@@ -@@ fi writers of the next generation . C@@ ory Doc@@ tor@@ ow &apos;s popular novel , S@@ cro@@ o@@ g@@ led applies Or@@ well &apos;s style in the description of a future where a person can be pic@@ tured terri@@ f@@ y@@ ingly well only by using Google data .
The mur@@ derer of two was assisted by two minors in hi@@ ding the traces in Ó@@ z@@ d
&quot; The police inter@@ ro@@ gated two minors about the double hom@@ ici@@ de committed in Ó@@ z@@ d . There are reasonable grounds for suspec@@ ting that they assisted the mur@@ derer in hi@@ ding the traces of the crime &quot; , says the spo@@ kes@@ man of the main police station of Bor@@ so@@ d County .
The two young people admitted having committed the mentioned act , they are currently accused of ai@@ ding and abet@@ ting .
The two minors - 2 girls , according to the information provided by MT@@ I - answer to the charges at large .
Ai@@ ding and abet@@ ting can be punished by a maximum of 5 years of im@@ prison@@ ment .
The suspect of the double hom@@ ici@@ de committed in Ó@@ z@@ d - a 23@@ -@@ year-old local man - was taken to preliminary cu@@ sto@@ dy on Sunday .
He is accused of having committed pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated hom@@ ici@@ de against several people , for the sake of gain .
During the investigation , it turned out that the 23@@ -@@ year-old young man o@@ wed significant amount of money to a 5@@ 3-@@ year-old man .
The suspect did not intend to pay back the debt , so he drew his credi@@ tor to a sub@@ urban establishment of Ó@@ z@@ d last Wednesday , where he killed him and his 9-@@ year-old daughter .
According to the information of MT@@ I , the young man was determined to commit the crime , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the fact that he had previously hidden a gun at the pre@@ mise for this purpose .
The police is examining the gun and the conditions of the crime with the assistance of experts .
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted a bid to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million - approximately 5 billion Czech kor@@ unas - for the 100 % ownership of the Prague shares .
Lud@@ wi@@ k Sob@@ ole@@ wski , President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the bid that has been taken by the Polish , in spite of the fact that the Czech had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the group of potential owners of the Prague shares .
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-@@ owned .
99 percent of the st@@ akes are in the ownership of the Polish government , which plans to sell 60 percent of the papers during the next few months .
According to E@@ 15 , the Czech economic daily newspaper , the Polish have submitted the best bid for the Prague shares .
On the basis of the information provided by the Czech newspapers , offers have been received from the transatlantic exchange Nas@@ da@@ q , the New York Stock Exchange , the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse .
Pet@@ r K@@ ob@@ lic , director of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that - among those being interested in the Prague shares - the worst option was the Warsaw Stock Exchange , the selection of which would result the c@@ ess@@ ation of the Prague bour@@ se .
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange st@@ akes is estimated 5 to 10 billion kor@@ unas by the market experts .
On the basis of the agreement among the shareholders , 90 percent of the st@@ akes could be purchased .
The largest amount of shares is in the hand of the owner of the Patri@@ a Finance investment bank , having approximately 25 percent of the st@@ akes . It is followed by the C@@ esk@@ á Spor@@ it@@ el@@ na bank with 14.@@ 7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.@@ r.@@ l. with 13.@@ 5 percent .
About the financial crisis from the view of European newspapers
The leading European newspapers were descri@@ bing the ever-@@ deep@@ ening international financial crisis as &quot; a second September 11th &quot; in their Tuesday comments .
The global financial catastrop@@ he is due to the American president - says the Rom@@ e-@@ based La Rep@@ ub@@ b@@ lica bl@@ am@@ ingly - the president was not even able to have his own party back up the has@@ ti@@ ly prepared bill which is supposed to find the way out of the de@@ pressing situation ...
It is not so much a new Pear@@ l Har@@ bor , as War@@ ren Buff@@ ett billi@@ on@@ aire investor described it , but rather a second September 11th .
Some of the Madrid press also blame Washington for the situation .
In the view of El M@@ und@@ o , the collapse of the world economy is due to the lack of political leadership in the U.@@ S .
The American financial system is at a growing risk of collapse , which will make the whole world suffer .
Although Bush &apos;s plan was not perfect , now - pursuant to the con@@ gres@@ sional vote - the threatening risk is if Washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis .
World economy is han@@ ging in the air - just at the time when one of the biggest transformation of capitalism is taking place .
&quot; The threat cannot be ignored any more &quot; , marks the Tages@@ -@@ Anzei@@ ger from Geneva .
Some countries are still able to provide a life-@@ belt for the weak@@ ened financial institutions and can save those from bank@@ rupt@@ cy by the money of the taxpayers .
However , if further banks collapse , as in a domin@@ o-@@ effect , neither the funds nor new impro@@ vis@@ ations will help .
What we need in the long term is that the members of the European Union shall determine themselves to overcome their own national sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ness and centrali@@ ze the control over the divided financial markets .
&quot; The aid distributed just on Monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros &quot; , rec@@ alls the Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based Der Standard , adding that the wor@@ ries are getting to point out that , just like the Americans , the European taxpayers will also have to dig down into their po@@ ckets in order to remedy the situation .
The EU has not paid special attention to the crisis so far , which is now swe@@ eping through the old continent as a ts@@ un@@ ami .
It is not expected from the &quot; sa@@ vers &quot; to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the beginning but it would be important to determine the situations when the taxpayers &apos; money is necessary to be used in order to prevent a more serious damage .
Intel@@ ligent car im@@ it@@ ates the flying of a b@@ um@@ ble@@ be@@ e
What could be a better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than to m@@ im@@ ic nature &apos;s obstacle dete@@ c@@ tors ?
Let &apos;s examine be@@ es , for instance !
In a surprising project that is in progress at CE@@ AT@@ EC in Japan , the b@@ um@@ ble@@ be@@ e has given engineers at N@@ iss@@ an a strategic hin@@ t at how to design the next generation of cra@@ sh-@@ avoid@@ ance systems .
Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo , N@@ iss@@ an has built the BR@@ 23@@ C-@@ type Biom@@ im@@ atic Car Rob@@ ot Drive . It is a ro@@ bo@@ tic micro-@@ car that recre@@ ates be@@ e characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents col@@ li@@ sions altogether .
&quot; In flight , each be@@ e creates its own ov@@ al-@@ shaped personal space , which in fact closely res@@ embles our safety shi@@ eld &quot; , said Ka@@ zu@@ h@@ hi@@ ro Do@@ i brand director of technology , PR , research and development .
The compo@@ und structure of be@@ es &apos; eye plays a significant role , which makes the be@@ es able to see in all directions , at an angle of 300 degrees .
In order to recre@@ ate the function of a compo@@ und eye , the engineers came up with the idea of a laser range fin@@ der .
This device dete@@ cts obstacles up to two meters away within a 18@@ 0-@@ degree radi@@ us in front of the BR@@ 23@@ C , calcul@@ ates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-@@ board micro@@ processor , which is instantly translated into col@@ li@@ sion avoid@@ ance .
It takes just a fra@@ ction of a second to detect an obstacle , and the car ro@@ bot instantly changes direction m@@ im@@ i@@ cking the movements of a be@@ e by turning its wheels at the angle needed to avoid a col@@ li@@ sion .
One of the main differences from any current system is that the avoid@@ ance manoeu@@ vre is totally inst@@ inc@@ tive .
&quot; If that was not so , then the car ro@@ bot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles , &quot; says To@@ shi@@ y@@ u@@ ki An@@ do@@ h , manager of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s Mob@@ ility Labor@@ atory and principal engineer of the ro@@ bot car project .
It must react inst@@ inc@@ tively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner@@ -@@ most layer of the safety shi@@ eld , a layer in which a crash is currently considered un@@ avoid@@ able .
The whole process must mirror what a be@@ e does to avoid other be@@ es .
It must happen within the b@@ link of an eye .
But unlike a be@@ e , it cannot devi@@ ate up@@ wards or down@@ wards or di@@ ag@@ on@@ ally , only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the wheels can turn .
So in place of the infin@@ ite number of ways a b@@ um@@ ble@@ be@@ e can avoid other be@@ es , here only the ro@@ tation function , the acceler@@ ation and the dec@@ eler@@ ation have been applied as available means of col@@ li@@ sion avoid@@ ance .
BR@@ 23@@ C uses li@@ thi@@ um-@@ poly@@ mer accum@@ ul@@ ators that are ligh@@ ter and have a higher energy density , which - compared to the li@@ thi@@ um-@@ ion version - assu@@ res longer lifetime .
According to An@@ do@@ h , what is important is the intelligent inst@@ inc@@ tive reaction , not the capability for data processing and storage .
The device is supposed to process only a few in@@ puts per second and react on them accordingly .
There is no need for stor@@ ing the in@@ puts and re@@ acting by the intuitive logic based on the previous manoeu@@ v@@ ring data , so it al@@ loc@@ ates continuously only a few do@@ zen ki@@ lob@@ y@@ tes of memory .
There is no need for gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te or me@@ gab@@ y@@ te size memory .
This is the first step of developing the instant col@@ li@@ sion avoid@@ ance technology that , on the basis of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s estimate , can be built into the seri@@ es-@@ produced cars within 10 years .
If connecting the device to the GPS satellite navigation system , an additional application option can be worked out which can help to avoid road barriers while driving .
A name granted to the expensive child
The written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic ba@@ il@@ out package has been drawn up . The draft law , applicable in several instal@@ ments , aims to purchase bad banking loans .
In the first round , half of the amount is planned to be spent .
&quot; During the further re@@ conci@@ li@@ ations having come to an end on Saturday night , East Coast time , the con@@ gres@@ sional leaders managed to agree on the debate of several days , which concerned the 700 billion dollar ba@@ il@@ out package &quot; , the Re@@ uters confirmed .
&quot; We have taken an important step forward &quot; , declared N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si , democratic chair@@ woman of the House of Represent@@ atives , adding that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement .
The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates , Barack Obama and John Mc@@ C@@ ain as well .
Refer@@ ring to the results of the compromise , Henry Pau@@ l@@ son , Secretary of the Treas@@ ury declared : the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient , but further steps are still to be taken . According to Pel@@ o@@ si , it is not about rescu@@ ing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy .
The written form of the package has been published at 8 pm on Sunday , Washington time , at the opening time of the Asian markets ( at 2 am in Cent@@ r@@ al-@@ Europe ) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market .
The draft legislation of the Emer@@ gency Economic Stabili@@ zation Act of 2008 will be put to the vote on Monday , first in the House of Represent@@ atives , secondly in the Sen@@ ate .
President George W. Bush talked to Pel@@ o@@ si on Saturday night , then the news on the agreement was welcomed in the White House as well .
&quot; We are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabili@@ ze our financial markets and protect our economy &quot; , declared Tony F@@ rat@@ to , spo@@ kes@@ man of the White House .
The programme diff@@ ers from the proposal having been first submitted by the Bus@@ h-@@ administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities .
Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday . One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities . An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used .
The programme will be superv@@ ised by a separate body with the involvement of the chairman of the Federal Reserve .
On how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress .
Pur@@ su@@ ant to the law , the Secretary of the Treas@@ ury is entitled to apply a combined tac@@ tic : it can buy bad loans , mort@@ g@@ ages , mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities and other types of &quot; po@@ ison@@ ous &quot; credits .
The purchase can be realized on au@@ ctions or in a direct way , according to the Treas@@ ury .
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the wor@@ ris@@ ome assets will be guaranteed by the Treas@@ ury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages .
Henry Pau@@ l@@ son declared : pursuant to the law , the required assets are provided depending on the situation ; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system , due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets , or the insurance of those , or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes .
&quot; We will make the necessary arrangements in order to be ready for the implementation of the law , as soon as it has been signed &quot; , he added .
The directors of the troub@@ led banks waiting for state aid should count on that their sever@@ ance - which is simply called golden par@@ ach@@ ute in the overseas s@@ lang - will be restricted by the government .
The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only , limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treas@@ ury .
Re@@ stri@@ ction means that in case the Treas@@ ury purchases on auction , sur@@ tax is imposed on the golden par@@ ach@@ ute , unless the ru@@ ined bank director is sent to retirement .
In the course of buying bad loans directly , the government will aggressi@@ vely intervene in order to ensure that the amounts of manag@@ erial money are not exagger@@ ated .
It must be added that the existing golden par@@ ach@@ ute contracts will not be amended , restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme .
&quot; This is the first time in American history that legal restriction will be imposed regarding the remuner@@ ation of chief executive officers &quot; , comm@@ ented House Financial Service Committee Chairman Bar@@ ney Frank , of the Democratic Party .
Besides , the government will be confer@@ red with the right of holding acquisition , this way taxpayers &apos; risk will reduce , since they might even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescu@@ ed bank is recover@@ ed .
The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years , which speci@@ fies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector .
Sc@@ ep@@ tics gave voice for their doubts regarding the plan on both sides , too .
&quot; This is not what American citizens expect from us , this will not protect taxpayers &apos; dollars &quot; , stated Republi@@ can Representative Dar@@ rell I@@ ssa from California .
His Democratic colleague , Mary Kap@@ tur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street .
Industrial prices keep growing
&quot; Industrial domestic sales prices of August 2008 rose by 0.@@ 1 percent as compared to the previous month , and by 12.@@ 9 percent in comparison with the figures of August 2007 &quot; , K@@ S@@ H inform@@ s .
In relation to the data of July 2008 , industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher . When compared to the same period of the previous year , however , the prices decre@@ ased by 3.@@ 9 percent .
As a result of the domestic and export price changes , industrial producer prices went up by 0.@@ 7 percent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 percent in relation to the figures recorded one year earlier .
Industrial domestic sales prices showed a growth of only 0.@@ 1 percent compared to the previous month .
Dom@@ estic sales prices of the manufacturing industry increased only by 0.@@ 1 percent as well , in comparison to the figures of July .
In August 2008 the biggest price increase was experienced in leather , foot@@ wear manufacturing industry ( 2.@@ 8 percent ) , due especially to the 4.@@ 6 percent price increase in bag and stra@@ p production as well as the 2.5 percent monthly price increase in foot@@ wear production .
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials are responsible for a significant monthly growth in the prices of the production of chemical materials and products ( 1.@@ 6 percent ) .
The prices decre@@ ased in cru@@ de oil processing ( 1.4 percent ) , in the production of electric machin@@ eries , tools ( 0.@@ 9 percent ) as well as - to a minimal extent - in wood processing ( 0.@@ 1 percent ) .
The prices of paper production as well as of publishing and printing activities have not changed .
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry the recorded price increase was between 0.@@ 2 percent and 0.@@ 9 percent .
The prices in electricity , gas , steam and water supply playing a significant role in the domestic industrial sales , rose by 0.@@ 3 percent , due mainly to the widely influ@@ encing gas price increase , which had been introduced by the authorities on 1st July .
Com@@ par@@ ing the figures of the last 12 months - considering the domestic sales of manufacturing sectors - the highest price increase ( 3@@ 2.4 percent ) was observed in cru@@ de oil processing .
In the production of metal processing a price increase of 13.@@ 2 percent , in the field of food , be@@ verage , tobacco production 11 percent growth was seen .

Prices in the whole manufacturing industry increased by 10.@@ 2 percent during the last 12 months .
Electri@@ city , gas , steam and water supply prices exceeded the figures of the previous year by 18.@@ 7 percent .
Consi@@ dering domestic sales within the sectors of destination , the highest monthly growth rate of August ( 0.@@ 7 percent ) was experienced in the sectors producing capital goods .

No Visa Ne@@ eded to the US from Next Year ?
According to King@@ a G@@ ön@@ cz , there is a good chance that the Americ@@ an-@@ Hungarian agreement on visa exemption will take effect around 12th January , said the foreign minister in Chicago , holding a speech before the leaders of the local Hung@@ arians .
She added that &quot; everything depends on whether the electronic access control system will be employed overseas in time &quot; .
She called attention to the fact that though there would be no entry permit in the new system , tourists will have to register before travel .
The leader of the Hungarian diplomacy is having negotiations in Washington from today .
She is meeting Secretary of State Con@@ dol@@ ee@@ zza R@@ ice to whom she is giving the me@@ dal Middle Cross of the Dec@@ oration of Hungarian Republic with the Star and holding consultations with the foreign affairs consultants of the presidential candidates Barack Obama , Democratic Party and John Mc@@ C@@ ain , Republi@@ can Party .
Both Barack Obama and Mc@@ C@@ ain support the bank rescue package
Both Barack Obama and John Mc@@ C@@ ain , presidential candidates of the two main American parties , confirmed on Sunday to back the government &apos;s 700 billion dollar bank rescue package , though there are politicians calling for the treas@@ ury secre@@ tary to re@@ sign .
After several days of mar@@ athon negotiations , the con@@ gres@@ sional and government representatives announced at Sunday da@@ wn : they have reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package .
Wall Street crisis and the financial package aiming to render the frozen credit market have become central issues of the presidential campaign .
Both Obama and Mc@@ C@@ ain seem to act in a way to prove : he is more suitable than his competi@@ tor to lead the country out of the economic crisis .
According to the latest surveys , due to the economic issues which have come into the fore@@ ground , Obama has gained some advantage again , while Mc@@ C@@ ain &apos;s leading position - that he had acquired after the Republi@@ can convention , by having appointed Sar@@ ah P@@ alin as vic@@ e-@@ president - has now mel@@ ted .
Obama expressed his hope at a campaign gathering in Det@@ ro@@ it regarding the fast con@@ gres@@ sional approval of the act on the 700 billion dollar package .
He emphasi@@ zed that the proposal included those consumer protection pass@@ ages that he had supported , too .
&quot; We must act now , with responsibility ( ... ) people &apos;s jobs , their savings , entire industries , the stabili@@ zation of the whole economy are the things that are threatened &quot; , he added in front of a crowd of 35 000 people .
He did not miss the chance to describe Mc@@ C@@ ain &apos;s economic concepts as out@@ dated .
Mc@@ C@@ ain stated in his report given to AB@@ C that &quot; this is a situation that will take long for all of us to di@@ gest ( ... ) but doing nothing is just cannot be aff@@ orded &quot; .
The Republi@@ can sen@@ ator declared that the proposal included the need to set up a committee super@@ vising the treas@@ ury secre@@ tary and to restrict the sever@@ ance of top leaders , it was him who had insi@@ sted on these issues .
Obama said to C@@ BS that Mc@@ C@@ ain had played no essential role in the re@@ conci@@ li@@ ations , while he had been in daily contact with the secre@@ tary .
N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si , chair@@ woman of the House of Represent@@ atives provided the information that the House of Represent@@ atives was expected to vote on the bill on Monday .
News From The German Pap@@ ers
The right wing is un@@ touched , only the voters of the group have become more self-@@ conscious - Der Spiegel analyses the weak presence of CS@@ U in Bavaria .
Ha@@ i@@ der and his party are ready to go@@ vern Austria in order to avoid re@@ d-@@ black coalition .
Der Spiegel ( spie@@ gel@@ .de )
Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CS@@ U &apos;s dramatic defeat in his article The Bavarian revolution is eating up its parents , released in the Internet publication of the left wing news magazine .
According to the popular political scienti@@ st , the ero@@ sion of CS@@ U had began far before the sad B@@ eck@@ stein@@ -@@ Hu@@ ber du@@ o took over the office .
Christian soci@@ alists were doing reforms in Bavaria for long decades - at the present these modern citizens are the ones who turn away .
The beginning of a new era means a problem for all Christian democracy , including Angela Merkel as well .
The defeat did not really surprise CS@@ U but a whole process ended on Sunday , a process that had been likely to happen in the last 10 years : the c@@ ess@@ ation of the indisp@@ utable he@@ gemon@@ y of a state party .
Ten years ago , in 1998 CS@@ U land@@ ed on 4@@ 7.@@ 7 percent , the first time under 50 percent since the fif@@ ties .
It happened again 3 years ago , during the Bun@@ de@@ stag election 2005 , namely in the oft@@ -@@ mentioned Sto@@ i@@ ber era .
The reason for it was the consistent moderni@@ zation carried out by CS@@ U in the province , which e@@ ats up its parents .
Soci@@ ologists have predic@@ ted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong . Nevertheless , sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ zation , educational results , the sett@@ ling of Germans from the Eastern and Northern part of the country to the developing regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the CS@@ U loyalty of the voters .
Moder@@ nis@@ ation comes together with the growth of opportunities and it has its own political consequences .
The right wing is un@@ touched , only the voters of the group have become more self-@@ conscious , critical and wil@@ ful .
What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks , mainly classical civil groups were depar@@ ting from CS@@ U ; people of the liberal prof@@ essions , industrial workers , people with secondary school certificate , people with college or university degree .
CS@@ U support here has been dimin@@ ished to below 40 percent .
Die Presse ( die@@ pres@@ se@@ .com )
&quot; Who , with whom ? Party chair@@ men are reserved considering coalition issues &quot; is the title of the article in which the Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based conservative daily newspaper is analy@@ zing the conf@@ using domestic political situation developed after the Austrian elections .
SP@@ Ö intends to negotiate with Ö@@ VP .
Ö@@ VP prohi@@ bits SP@@ Ö to intervene to its internal issues .
B@@ Z@@ Ö seems open to negotiate in all directions , the gre@@ ens do not wish to re@@ conci@@ le on coalition yet .
The election has already taken place , now everything is about the coalition ; during the debate organized by the public television , there was hardly any chance to gain insight into the party leaders &apos; cards .
SP@@ Ö Chairman Werner Fa@@ y@@ mann confirmed his willingness to negotiate with Ö@@ VP .
SP@@ Ö would like to show that the cooperation of the two parties is possible - it does exist in some of the provin@@ ces as well as in social partnership .
Fa@@ y@@ mann left the question of a coalition with Wilhelm Mol@@ ter as vic@@ e-@@ chan@@ cell@@ or - currently Ö@@ VP chairman - open .
As he said , the Schü@@ ssel@@ -@@ Mol@@ terer course has been rejected .
Tur@@ ning towards this direction again is out of question .
Mol@@ terer was cau@@ tious in handling red offers .
According to him , the cooperation by no means will be successful in case Fa@@ y@@ mann tries to intervene to the internal issues of Ö@@ VP .
Whether choosing to remain opposition or entering a coalition is still an open question in the party , this issue has definitely to be discussed within Ö@@ VP .
B@@ Z@@ Ö Chairman J@@ ör@@ g Ha@@ i@@ der repeatedly seemed to be open to all alternatives .
&quot; In order to prevent a re@@ d-@@ black coalition , we are ready to undertake government responsibility &quot; , declared Ha@@ i@@ der .
J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka : The vi@@ cious circle of poverty , se@@ gre@@ gation must be eliminated
The European E@@ quality Summit has been opened today in Paris , which is organized by France this year , representing the Presiden@@ cy-@@ in-@@ office of the European Union .
In her message that she addressed to the plen@@ um , L@@ í@@ via J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka of Fi@@ des@@ z , Representative of the European People &apos;s Party called attention for the educational se@@ gre@@ gation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children . Moreover , this is the largest barrier to their prosperity .
The high level conference has been opened by X@@ avier Ber@@ tr@@ and , French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and V@@ ladimir Sp@@ id@@ la , European Commissioner responsible for Employment , Social Affairs and Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities .
Represent@@ atives of the governments , the European social partners and the most significant European legal aid organizations and NGOs from the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference .
J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka - according to the press office of the Fi@@ des@@ z group in the EP - pointed out that , in addition to the discrimination experienced when applying for a job , Roma people are se@@ gre@@ gated from the labour market mainly because of their low educational qualification .
&quot; Most of the young Roma people do not have a secondary school qualification , and due to the low quality of the basic education only an in@@ significant part of them can obtain college or university degree &quot; .
J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka also emphasi@@ zed that education , as a fundamental human right , plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights .
Invest@@ ing in the early education of Roma children can contribute to strengthening the economy of the European Union member states .
According to the representative , it is necessary to inform the wi@@ dest range of people - Roma and non-@@ Roma people as well - about these inter@@ relationships .
The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school , the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market ; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget .
&quot; On grounds of the citizenship right applied in the European Union , the right of quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality , se@@ gre@@ gated education must be eliminated &quot; , added L@@ í@@ via J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka .
She also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school des@@ e@@ gre@@ gation , it is necessary to guarantee an objec@@ ti@@ ve@@ - and ac@@ tion-@@ oriented cooperation within the European Union . To ac@@ comp@@ lish this goal , it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti-@@ discrimination directives .
&quot; The vi@@ cious circle of poverty , se@@ gre@@ gation , unemployment must be eliminated , Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights &quot; , demanded J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka .
Within the framework of the &quot; European Year of Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities &quot; , the European E@@ quality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti-@@ discrimination at European and member state level as well .
CS@@ U : Tran@@ sition Gra@@ ce Peri@@ od
Decision About De@@ fe@@ ated Hu@@ ber@@ -B@@ eck@@ stein Du@@ o At The End Of October
Despite ign@@ om@@ ini@@ ous election failure heads have not rolled yet , personal issues are ad@@ jour@@ ned temporarily at the Bavarian CS@@ U sum@@ mits .
President of the Party , Er@@ win Hu@@ ber and State Prime Minister , G@@ ün@@ ther B@@ eck@@ stein may still keep their positions , the question is how long grace takes .
The dest@@ iny of the tan@@ dem which have suffered a catastrop@@ hi@@ c 17 percent vote loss will be decided by the extraordinary party congress at the last weekend of October .
However , members of the much critici@@ zed du@@ o pic@@ tured : they do not insist on their seats by all means .
With this they intended to appe@@ ase the fu@@ ri@@ ous members of the fra@@ ction and the basis who were claiming personal consequence because of having lost clear majority one day after the &quot; Bavarian ts@@ un@@ ami &quot; .
Five years ago the Christian Social Union - true , lead by Ed@@ mund Sto@@ i@@ ber who had been at the top of his career at that time - had obtained 6@@ 0.@@ 7 percent but now , one year after the coup against Sto@@ i@@ ber , the party could reach 4@@ 3.@@ 4 percent only .
CS@@ U had been &quot; absolute rul@@ er &quot; in Bavaria presenting 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years .
Although con@@ servatives are still considered the most important party in the Southern province , which has key role for the Hungarian economy , they are definitely forced to form a coalition in the future .
As one of the first signs of restructuring within the party , Hu@@ ber &apos;s potential successor , Party Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Hor@@ st Seeh@@ o@@ fer becomes member of the small expl@@ or@@ atory team beginning investig@@ ative negotiations about a possible Mun@@ ich@@ -based government coalition with liberal F@@ DP as well as with Free Vo@@ ters representing right-@@ wing values .
Iron@@ y of fate is that Gabri@@ ele Pau@@ li , whose intervention against Sto@@ i@@ ber had been mis@@ used as a coup opportunity and later was handled roughly by the Hu@@ ber@@ -B@@ eck@@ stein du@@ o , becomes member of the legislative assembly from the party list of Free Vo@@ ters .
Le@@ aders of CS@@ U are making efforts on stabili@@ zing B@@ eck@@ stein in any way .
Sto@@ i@@ ber , who was staying in the background until now , will have an active role in the transition time , the ex-@@ state prime minister and former CS@@ U president claimed 28@@ th September the dark@@ est day of his political career .
Hu@@ ber made some bitter comments on CD@@ U on Monday , according to him CS@@ U would have deser@@ ved much more support from its fr@@ at@@ ern@@ al party .
Other CS@@ U politicians think that the defeat is a warning to both CD@@ U and Angela Merkel .
After the Bun@@ de@@ stag Ele@@ ction due in September 2009 , Merkel cannot be chan@@ cell@@ or , unless CS@@ U , which was playing significant role in the 2005 national success , is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated through mutual efforts .
According to the disappointed Merkel , the failure of CS@@ U will not have a negative impact on the coalition government in Berlin .
Although it is relative : the wo@@ unded CS@@ U is not going to be easier to handle and the crisis of the social demo@@ crats is going to continue .
SP@@ D has achieved its weak@@ est result with 18.@@ 6 percent in Bavaria since 194@@ 6 .
Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko@@ -@@ Opposition : 1@@ 10-@@ 0
No opposition representative was elected to the Belar@@ u@@ sian parliament during the Sunday &apos;s election .
According to Russian observers , the reasons for this are the welfare and stability in the country led by Alexander Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko , while Organization for Security and Co-@@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) explains it as vote counting frau@@ ds .
OSCE deleg@@ ating 450 observers from 43 countries ref@@ uses to recognize the election .
Although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade , before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of United Democratic For@@ ces ( U@@ DF ) had seriously expected that Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko , who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2006 after the amendments of the constitution , was going to &quot; allow &quot; presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time .
Based on this , U@@ DF desi@@ sted from the formerly considered boy@@ cot@@ t , too .
The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the economically increasingly Russi@@ a-@@ dependent Belarus - that had raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Bel@@ trans@@ gas own@@ ing gas pi@@ pel@@ ines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wished to improve its relations with the EU , where visa is not granted for Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko and for a number of top politicians due to the Belar@@ u@@ sian political system , which is considered anti-@@ democratic .
The fact that OSCE when having evaluated the election campaign rather focused on positive changes instead of defici@@ encies - like bann@@ ing one third of the opposition candidates from taking part in the elections - indicated dé@@ ten@@ te formerly .
However , O@@ ES@@ C &apos;s Monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the counting of votes .
According to the opposition , improvement is still perc@@ ep@@ tible in the political system : political prisoners have been disch@@ ar@@ ged and Min@@ sk is inc@@ lined to confront with Moscow in a minor way by still not recogn@@ izing South O@@ sse@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia which have sec@@ eded from Georgia , although Russia - forming a federal state with Belarus on paper - has already been considering the two territories independent for a month .
&quot; We have taken two steps ahead and one back@@ wards , but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started &quot; , told Alexander Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch to our paper .
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election of 2006 , this dialogue needs to be maintained in spite of the fact that the &quot; power has got afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight &quot; .
Se@@ eing the results , the opposition does not plan prote@@ sting actions , rather aims to reach voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms .
&quot; We have much trouble with this of course , we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia , distribution is hin@@ dered by the local authorities , but I can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people , amongst the old , too &quot; , said Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch referring to the fact that Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko &apos;s regime , which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result , is considered inappropriate even by pension@@ ers who are officially most supported class of society of all .
&quot; O@@ wing to the in@@ deb@@ te@@ dness of the country and the increase of trade deficit , the break@@ -@@ down of social security &apos; similar to dead silence &apos; is a question of time &quot; , Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch claimed .
Russian observers described the elections as democratic , in contradiction to the opposition politi@@ cian .
Comm@@ on@@ wealth of Independent States mission leader Ser@@ ge@@ i Le@@ be@@ dev told Russian news agency , R@@ ia Novo@@ sti : &quot; People believe in actions not words &quot; , so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of Belar@@ u@@ sian voters &apos; mat@@ urity .
Brun@@ etta : &quot; From now on breakfast before work &quot;
It has never happened in all the history of the Chi@@ gi Palace that there were revol@@ ving doors at the employee entrance and exit .
But as from today , a new measure starts against cra@@ f@@ ty ski@@ vers , against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours .
The novel anti-@@ sl@@ ack@@ ers measure has been presented today by the Public Administration Minister , Ren@@ ato Brun@@ etta , and by the Secretary General of the Office of the President of the Council , Mau@@ ro Mas@@ i .
&quot; The revol@@ ving doors – says Brun@@ etta – are a tool for working better , with a higher productivity , higher presence and more services &quot; speci@@ fies the minister .
&quot; Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens .
This is reform@@ ism &quot; , under@@ lines again Brun@@ etta .
With the Chi@@ gi Palace , the installation in all the buildings of the Office of the President of the Council is complete .
For Mas@@ i &quot; the choice of revol@@ ving doors is also important from a symbolic view@@ point &quot; .
There has been no opposition from the employees , assu@@ res the Secretary General : &quot; It has been a process shared by the workers and everybody collabor@@ ated &quot; .
To conclude , no more breakfast during working hours ; no more coffee and cro@@ iss@@ ant .
A word from Brun@@ etta , who suggests , sm@@ iling , &quot; a good c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ ino at seven is bl@@ essed &quot; .
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
of Rome , the minister , afterwards , makes known that &quot; in three months the ab@@ sen@@ ces , by public employees , due to si@@ ckness have reduced by 50 % , that is 60 thousand more people at work in a year &quot; .
And adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient .
Itali@@ ans , &quot; whose wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8 – 10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate &quot; .
Mean@@ time thousands of public employees have united to challenge the provisions set by the Brun@@ etta decre@@ e adher@@ ing to the petition supported by Co@@ d@@ ac@@ ons .
&quot; While the minister for Civil Service today par@@ ades the figures regarding the reduced ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm at work due to si@@ ckness – the consumers &apos; association writes – the population of ‘ the industri@@ ous ski@@ vers &apos; is continuously increasing .
In fact , in Italy there are thousands of honest and productive public administration employees that have united to declare war on the il@@ legitimate provisions within the decre@@ e &quot; .
In particular , at the T@@ AR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for in@@ fir@@ m@@ ity incurred during work will be con@@ tested ; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for control medical visits , and other aspects within the new provisions insi@@ sted on by the minister .
Ac@@ ci@@ dents at work , Na@@ poli@@ tano : &quot; Pre@@ vention is crucial &quot;
Every@@ day , in Italy , at work 2@@ 500 accidents occur , 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently invali@@ d .
For 2007 , IN@@ A@@ IL data confirm that in fact work related deaths have been around 1200 .
Fig@@ ures that witness the gra@@ vity of a phenomenon that remains one of the principal causes of death and causes almost double the deaths with respect to hom@@ ici@@ de .
To recall the attention of institutions , social forces and information media to this dramatic issue , today An@@ mi@@ l is celeb@@ rating in all the Italian provin@@ ces the 5@@ 8th National Day for Cas@@ u@@ alties of Ac@@ ci@@ dents at Work , institution@@ alised onto the second Sunday of October .
&quot; The worrying data diff@@ used by An@@ mi@@ l and the very same tragic current news confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is &quot; , decla@@ res the President of the Republic Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ poli@@ tano , in his message to the president of An@@ mi@@ l , National Association of the Mu@@ til@@ ated and Inv@@ ali@@ ds at Work , Piet@@ ro Merc@@ and@@ elli .
The head of the State expresses his &quot; deep appreciation of the constant associ@@ ative efforts for prevention at the workplace , car@@ ing for injured workers , assistance of the cas@@ u@@ alties &apos; families , and the sensi@@ tiz@@ ation of public opinion &quot; .
&quot; Naturally , an indi@@ gn@@ ant ‘ enough &apos; has been raised , sincerely shared in front of trage@@ dies that , due to their size , provo@@ ke an out@@ c@@ ry by the media and the involvement of public opinion but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases , whose dynamics are even re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; .
Na@@ poli@@ tano does not conce@@ al that &quot; undoubtedly there &apos;s also a resources problem : it &apos;s important to invest in training and information .
A particular significance is assumed by the numerous initiatives promoted within the schools in raising awareness of the younger generation that face the work market .
It &apos;s a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon , not give up to its serious social alarm , apply and improve the legislative provisions .
On his part the president of the Chamber Gi@@ an@@ fran@@ co Fin@@ i has under@@ lined &quot; as the phenomenon of acci@@ dental deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency , that off@@ ends the conscience of each and every one of us and im@@ poses on all the institutions a decisive obligation towards urgently ending it &quot; .
&quot; Data regarding inj@@ uries at the workplace seem to signal a small positive trend , but this does not take away the fact that the number of acci@@ dental deaths is in any case impressive &quot; , re@@ marked the president of An@@ mi@@ l Piet@@ ro Merc@@ and@@ elli .
&quot; We do not want , in fact , that this ‘ down@@ turn trend &apos; is translated into a reduced al@@ er@@ tness , because it is just when the attention is reduced that tragedy explo@@ des .
&quot; We believe that at a general level little is being done to oppose the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight could be carried on through multiple actions .
It is necessary , in our opinion , - under@@ lined Merc@@ and@@ elli – to have more controls and inspections , but also a stronger intervention on the worker training , and this should start at school &quot; .
&quot; A greater effort is required – he added – with regards to the communication and sensi@@ tiz@@ ation of public opinion .
But , above all , a greater sense of responsibility is required on behalf of employers in respect of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency &quot; .
Merc@@ and@@ elli then den@@ ounced &quot; the progressive deterioration of the level of care benefit provided for cas@@ u@@ alties at work &quot; and the &quot; welfare dri@@ ft which the system is taking in the last few years &quot; .
&quot; Hence , the objective is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spon@@ tane@@ ous political actions or grants which are from time to time set out by legislat@@ ors &quot; .
M@@ p@@ 3 players under accus@@ ation , they put hearing at risk
List@@ ening to music at high volume for a prolon@@ ged period of time using portable musical devices such as M@@ p@@ 3 players could cause permanent le@@ sions to hearing .
This is what a European Commission reports , which in a communication released in Brussels c@@ ites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emer@@ ging and New@@ ly Identi@@ fied Health Ris@@ ks ( SC@@ EN@@ I@@ HR ) of the EU , published today .
&quot; From this scientific advice – the note reads – emer@@ ges that 5@@ - 10 % of those that , for a period of at least 5 years , listen to music using portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability &quot; .
&quot; It wor@@ ries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cell@@ ular phones at very high volume may un@@ consci@@ ously damage their hearing in an irre@@ par@@ able way &quot; , decla@@ res Meg@@ len@@ a Kun@@ eva .
&quot; From the scientific findings – carries on the EU spo@@ kes@@ person – a clear risk emer@@ ges and we have to react rapidly .
What counts most , we need to sensi@@ ti@@ ze consumers and make this information available to the public .
Besides , in light of this scientific advice , we have to re-@@ examine exist@@ ent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology &quot; .
Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem , seeing the widespread use of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate .
&quot; Scienti@@ sts – concludes the EU executive – confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now examine , together with member states and other interested parties , what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment &quot; .
Currently , a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 d@@ B , but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources , are increasing .
It is possible to considerably limit the damage by res@@ or@@ ting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure .
In its opinion , the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical players listen to music at high volume ( &gt; 89 d@@ B ) for only 5 hours per week , they are already over the per@@ missible maximum noise limits currently in place for the workplace .
People who listen to music under such conditions for longer du@@ rations risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period .
This is the case for 5-@@ 10 % of users of such devices and their number can be quanti@@ fied to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the EU .
Rome , Ale@@ man@@ no gives the go ahead to the Commission for the Future of the Capital
Today it starts , in March it concludes , in June the conclusions are drawn .
This is the schedule set by the Camp@@ i@@ do@@ g@@ lio for the &quot; Commission for the Future of the Capital &quot; , which has this morning taken up residence at its new premises behind the Car@@ ac@@ alla Hot Spr@@ ings .
In six months , the president Antonio Mar@@ z@@ ano and the other 49 components of the Commission will set down the guidelines for Rome .
Once the project has been concluded in March , the Municip@@ al Board and Council will evaluate the analysis and projects , so that in June the strategic plan for Rome can be presented with the official stam@@ p of the Camp@@ i@@ do@@ g@@ lio and the may@@ or Gi@@ anni Ale@@ man@@ no .
&quot; The commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions , social , and cultural are represented – under@@ lines Ale@@ man@@ no – It should make proposals for a development plan of Rome on which the political exec@@ u@@ tives , which are always the Municip@@ al Board and Council , can rely .
There is no super@@ position of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up .
In March its job will be done and it will dis@@ solve , because this experiment should have a precise deadline .
In June – the may@@ or announ@@ ces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital &quot; .
For those who acc@@ use the Commission of being us@@ eless , since its opinions will not be binding , Ale@@ man@@ no rep@@ lies : &quot; Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals .
If the quality is there , as in France with the Att@@ ali Commission and as I &apos;m sure there will be in Rome , then its contribution will be fundamental .
Too often politics are overwhel@@ med by everyday administration and by emer@@ gen@@ cies that mani@@ fest themselves from time to time .
On the contrary , we want to look further for@@ wards and further ahead , with a deeper perspective , working seriously on the development of Rome and its future .
Furthermore , the may@@ or of Rome would like to point out that &quot; this commission is neither a us@@ eless agency nor an un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy bureaucratic organisation : it &apos;s absolutely free , it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will serve to get reason@@ ing and get involved the best minds that the Capital has to offer &quot; .
For Ale@@ man@@ no , in fact , &quot; it &apos;s essential to have a strategic reference plan , not closed or in@@ flexible , to permit our city to do an authentic lea@@ p in quality , which it really needs , thinking with a united spirit of its future .
A future that , speci@@ fies the Mayor of Rome &quot; will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further a@@ field &quot; not only with the view of a future metro@@ politan city and its legal status as Capital but &quot; also with consideration to the role that Rome could and must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean &quot; .
Obama ? The first anti-@@ American President . Here is why ?
A famous American politi@@ cian , who would like to pass off as independent , wrote : Barack Obama will be the second anti-@@ American president .
The first was Jim@@ my Car@@ ter , who with his decisions deci@@ m@@ ated the US economy and had deal@@ ings ( as he still does today as a private citizen ) with the enemy Islam &quot; .
Att@@ acks on Obama increase right as the election date ne@@ ars .
A lady from Mi@@ ami has written on the web : &quot; This person is full of ambitions .
Obama is being che@@ ek@@ y : he thinks he can win the highest position in a country which has had in total two govern@@ ors and five sen@@ ators that were black ! &quot; .
In reality , these are attacks that don &apos;t mean a lot : they are clearly ra@@ cial attacks and do not answer the elec@@ tors &apos; question : will he be a good president ? And then there are the p@@ olls ; all of them say that Obama will win and by a wide margin .
Even in this case there are those who speak from the heart and not from the head .
A Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i newspaper , deep in the South of the United States , wrote an edi@@ torial : once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to whom the American patri@@ ot will give his vote .
A side of the United States ment@@ ality that has been kept under wra@@ ps to the last , emer@@ ges .
&quot; Sa@@ y whatever you like , afterwards we &apos;ll take care of where to put the cross , for Obama or for Mc@@ C@@ ain &quot; .
There are people who swe@@ ar : if Obama wins , we will go away from America .
Th@@ ings that have never been said before now , when the success of the black candidate is almost certain .
However , in spite of all these arguments , the winning tru@@ mp for the Democrats is George Bush .
1500 people have been asked what have been the errors committed by Bush during his mandate ? 89 per cent have answered : Iraq .
America changes .
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs .
In Iraq 4@@ 500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack up and leave .
Yet , for the majority Iraq has been the weak point of Bush .
W@@ ho@@ ever takes up the place of George W. will have an enormous task to do .
USA , the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists : in the newspapers it is time for cuts . And many blame the internet , &quot; kil@@ ler &quot; of the printed paper .
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by P@@ EW Research Centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the future .
Well , nowadays journalists are almost all of them p@@ essimis@@ tic regarding their future .
Yet , to the information c@@ ler@@ ks , they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility .
They don &apos;t feel as isolated as they used to .
The problem for American journalists is the money , the money .
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model .
Furthermore the cuts carried out in the news@@ room , the office where edi@@ tors work to ass@@ emble the newspaper , are a big problem .
It &apos;s a problem that needs to be resolved , according to the journalists inter@@ viewed , if we do not want that traditional journ@@ alism as it is understood by the general public is substantially dimin@@ ished .
A clear but complex p@@ essimis@@ m nowadays per@@ v@@ ades American journalists .
Six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior exec@@ u@@ tives are convinced that journ@@ alism at a national level is going down the wrong road .
Within the local field the executive group is 65 % .
Prin@@ ted against broadcast .
It &apos;s not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going .
The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet , by many seen as the &quot; ass@@ assi@@ n &quot; of the printed paper .
The &quot; economic pressure &quot; that journalists have felt has increased up to 79 % .
The 500 journalists inter@@ viewed have admitted that they are emb@@ racing technology hoping that it &quot; will do some good &quot; for their journ@@ alism .
The biggest rift in American journ@@ alism nowadays is between those who manage the news@@ rooms – that is the directors – and the re@@ por@@ ters who work for them .
56 % of managers at national level are certain that their re@@ por@@ ters share their values , whilst at local level the percentage decre@@ ases to 23 % .
For some this has got to do with &quot; job security &quot; .
On a national level , 43 % of the managers believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years .
For journalists the figure is 30 % .
As for &quot; job security &quot; at staff level ( our edi@@ tors , n@@ d@@ r ) in America it varies on a day to day basis .
Only 13 % of journalists have a work contract .
In an immense nation such as the USA , with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journ@@ als , magazines , radio , TV , and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or leave it .
Directors almost always receive huge salaries , while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month , in addition to the pension and paid insur@@ ances .
As for holiday , things get complicated : so many days the first year , so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years .
But American journalists , by their own admission , fall frequently &quot; ill &quot; during the year .
It &apos;s all a question of climate .
UN@@ IP@@ OL : RO@@ ME TR@@ IB@@ UN@@ AL , D@@ AN@@ ILO CO@@ PP@@ OL@@ A ST@@ A@@ Y@@ S AT G@@ RO@@ TT@@ AF@@ ER@@ R@@ ATA
The president of the second pen@@ al section of the Rome tri@@ bunal , Car@@ mel@@ o Rin@@ au@@ do , has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent , Dan@@ il@@ o C@@ opp@@ ola that had requested to be able to move from his home town , Gro@@ t@@ ta@@ fer@@ rat@@ a , to an abo@@ de in Rome .
C@@ opp@@ ola is under investigation for bank@@ rupt@@ cy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter-@@ proposal regarding the Uni@@ pol@@ -B@@ n@@ l ta@@ ke@@ over .
While on trial , last week , he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to remain resident in Gro@@ t@@ ta@@ fer@@ rat@@ a .
His lawyers , Mich@@ ele G@@ enti@@ lon@@ i and Ga@@ et@@ ano P@@ eco@@ rel@@ la , had asked that the estate agent could travel from the country town within the province to an abo@@ de within the capital .
According to the tri@@ bunal , however , these trips ( against which the PM has advised ) would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence that is used to charge him .
The elite in danger
The phenomenon had already manifest@@ ed itself a couple of days back with the vote in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives against the rescue plan of 700 billion American dollars passed by the White House : a significant portion of Americans was , and still is , more interested in pun@@ ishing Wall Street than in saving the economy .
A confirmation was given by yesterday &apos;s New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republi@@ can Party , ever more divided between its old East Coast soul , moderate , in favour of federal institutions and the business community , and its new soul , instead conservative , hosti@@ le to &quot; those in Washington » and to the financial world , especially strong within the Central and Southern states .
The soul , to be exact , which has made itself over@@ bear@@ ingly alive with the vote mentioned initially .
The latter is but only one example of the changes , of the big changes , that the current economic earthquake perhaps her@@ al@@ ds or allows to be perceived : not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here .
Both in the USA as in Europe the crisis seems to act as a cataly@@ st for phenomena which have been in inc@@ ub@@ ation for some time and which in the new climate have solidi@@ fied and are finally coming to light .
The first of these phenomena is the bringing back up-to-date , the extraordinary re-@@ launch , of the twin category state-@@ sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-@@ nation@@ alisation of the economy .
The crisis , in fact , is a crisis for the finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ banking institutions who have , indeed , strong ties with foreign countries , but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation , in a single state .
This immediately creates a political problem for wh@@ o@@ ever is in government : and that is how to respond to the difficulties and the protests of those people and those families that , besides , also form the elec@@ torate .
In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem .
Political internation@@ alism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say : the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that , divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies , cannot decide on a common political path .
And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention , ba@@ il@@ out and re-@@ launching plans , new rules , and especially financial aid : since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources , the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things .
And they possess likewise the necessary means , and the legitimate reasons to use them : two resources of inc@@ omm@@ ensu@@ rable value , under certain circumstances , of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dis@@ pose of in an analo@@ g@@ ous measure .
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the stat@@ al-@@ national element is after all perfectly tun@@ ed with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attri@@ bute to a co@@ efficient that is very closely connected to that element : territori@@ ality .
Par@@ ado@@ x@@ ically , in fact , while we were convinced that we had entered the re@@ ign of the web , of a technology increasingly more sophisticated , of the im@@ material , while we were convinced that glob@@ alised finance was by now dest@@ ined to domin@@ ate the world , we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little im@@ material such as water , harv@@ ests , oil .
Ac@@ ci@@ dentally , all are items that can certainly be transported from one place to another but in any case are tied in an absolute fashion to a well defined space , to a territory .
So that wh@@ o@@ ever finds himself to be the sovereign , surely holds more cards in his deck than he who isn &apos;t , than he who happens to live in a place without crops , oil , or water .
I &apos;m getting to the second no@@ vel@@ ty that however predic@@ ts a split .
W@@ ho@@ ever says Territ@@ ory , State , Government , inevitably implies Poli@@ tics , and hence Le@@ a@@ dership .
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two conver@@ gent phenomena .
On the one hand the knowledge of the objective need for authorit@@ ative leadership , the demand for somebody who knows how to handle the situation .
On the other hand a wave of dis@@ credit for exist@@ ent leadership , an economic sort , revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas .
And together something ever deeper and in a certain way distur@@ bing : a dis@@ credit , an in@@ tolerance , an image of in@@ adequ@@ acy , a sense of re@@ mot@@ eness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever-@@ increasing number of Western countries .
Rather , it appears to make its way further in vast sections of the population the conviction which before that their actions are the same ideas as of the social elite up till now in favour , their way of feeling and being , their culture in all accepted mean@@ ings of the word , to have had their day , and to always be more alien to the opinion of the majority .
In other words , the call for leadership feeds under@@ han@@ de@@ dly a bran@@ ched but powerful movement of dele@@ gi@@ tim@@ ization of the manag@@ erial class and of the traditional political structures , that mani@@ fest itself in the sudden electoral &quot; revol@@ ts » or ab@@ rupt twi@@ sts in the collective mo@@ ods in these last and latest times , from the conservative rise in Austria – Bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain , to the re@@ bel@@ lion of the American con@@ gress@@ men against Bush ( and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it ) .
One gets the impression that the traditional elite , their parties , their programmes , but also their rites , their newspapers , their accredi@@ ted intellec@@ tu@@ als , some would say their formats , are finding it always more difficult to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end , and hence to represent , that which has been taking shape within the deep@@ est layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening , au@@ g@@ ment@@ ing , potentially ag@@ it@@ ating without restra@@ int .
In face of all this , talking about a &quot; re@@ bel@@ lion of the m@@ asses » as being the order of the day may be frank@@ ly exagger@@ ated .
But keeping one &apos;s eyes wide open , it is not for sure .
Super@@ glu@@ e to be able to walk on walls
To defeat the laws of gra@@ vity thanks to a super glu@@ e and in the future be able to walk up walls like Spi@@ der@@ man .
It &apos;s the aim of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close .
With an adhe@@ sive of only 2.5 cm squ@@ ared the scientists have succeeded in glu@@ ing a body of 100 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s onto a vertical wall .
Stu@@ dying – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Day@@ ton , Ak@@ ron , of the Georgia Institute of Technology , and of the Air Force Research Labor@@ atory .
The material invented by the team of scientists is an improvement on exist@@ ent materials that utili@@ se a particular carbon structure , called carbon n@@ an@@ ot@@ ub@@ es .
« The principle behind the glu@@ e could be ima@@ g@@ ined as being like a series of tu@@ bes arranged like a pi@@ le of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti » explains Z@@ h@@ ong L@@ in W@@ ang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlan@@ ta .
The scientists were inspired by the pa@@ ws of ge@@ ck@@ oes , covered with micro@@ scop@@ ic bri@@ st@@ les which succeed in ass@@ uring a perfect adhe@@ sion to the animal .
The tests conducted on various materials such as glass , Te@@ fl@@ on , and sand@@ paper have demonstrated that the new adhe@@ sive is ten times stronger than the pa@@ ws of this rep@@ tile and at the same time &quot; comes off from walls easier » explains Lim@@ ing Da@@ i , resear@@ cher at the Engineering Fac@@ ul@@ ty of the University of Day@@ ton .
W@@ AL@@ K ON W@@ ALL@@ S ? - &quot; This material could be useful as a temporary glu@@ e » adds Lim@@ ing Da@@ i .
Perhaps for walking on walls just like Spi@@ der@@ man ? Maybe yes , but the researchers are thinking of a less gl@@ amor@@ ous use such as the connections between electrical devices , because the carbon n@@ an@@ ot@@ ub@@ es are conduc@@ tors of heat and of electrical current .
Other applications could be within the a@@ erospace industry .
For now , no super@@ her@@ oes .
O@@ TH@@ ER RES@@ E@@ AR@@ CH – Even Ber@@ kel@@ ey University , in California , is dedic@@ ating itself to the research of a new adhe@@ sive .
In an article in the journ@@ al of the American Chem@@ ical Society the Califor@@ ni@@ an scientists have presented an adhe@@ sive composed of micro@@ fi@@ bers like hair that self-@@ clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhe@@ sion .
Dru@@ gs : Ne@@ ver with fruit ju@@ ices .
Be careful of gra@@ pe@@ fruit juice , orange juice , and app@@ le juice .
These drinks , especially consum@@ ed in summer because they are thir@@ st qu@@ en@@ ching and rich in vit@@ am@@ ins , if taken together with some li@@ fes@@ aving drugs may alter their absor@@ ption , ampli@@ fying or dimin@@ ishing , depending on the case , their efficiency with consequences that may also be serious for health .
Con@@ fir@@ ming the risks associated with the assumption of fruit ju@@ ices whether they are pre-@@ pack@@ aged or fresh with certain medicines is David Ba@@ i@@ ley , professor at the university of Western On@@ tari@@ o in London , who from the 23@@ 6th national meeting of the American Chem@@ ical Society under@@ way in Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a laun@@ ches a new warning : a glass of gra@@ pe@@ fruit juice , orange juice , or app@@ le juice is enough to reduce the absor@@ ption of certain li@@ fes@@ aving drugs , n@@ ul@@ li@@ fying their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients .
Gra@@ pe@@ fruit juice has already been accused because it was thought to be responsible for raising , up to levels thought to be toxic , the effects of some anti@@ rhyth@@ mic , antibio@@ tic , tranqu@@ ili@@ sing , anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ ic , and neuro@@ logical medicines .
DR@@ U@@ GS AT R@@ IS@@ K – The very same Italian Dru@@ g Agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago , al@@ er@@ ting doctors and patients to not under@@ estimate the dangers deri@@ ving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is dr@@ un@@ k in cases when drugs are taken such as for example Di@@ az@@ ep@@ am or Me@@ th@@ ad@@ one .
NOT ON@@ L@@ Y G@@ RA@@ P@@ EF@@ R@@ U@@ IT J@@ U@@ ICE – According to experts even orange juice and app@@ le juice contain substances that in@@ hi@@ bit drugs .
The list of active principles in@@ hi@@ bited by gra@@ pe@@ fruit and other fruit ju@@ ices is very long .
Hence the appeal of Mich@@ ele Car@@ ru@@ ba , director of the Department of P@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology of the State University of Milan : &quot; U@@ su@@ ally , such dis@@ cover@@ ies are immediately brought to the attention of the various international and national drug agencies that then change the information sli@@ ps of medicines .
Therefore , always read the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear , do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chem@@ ist for clari@@ fications » emphasised the expert from the An@@ sa Agency .
The Nobel Prize for Economy to Paul Kru@@ g@@ man
The Nobel Prize for Economy goes to the American Paul Kru@@ g@@ man for his studies on market models and on the loc@@ alisation of economic activities .
55 year old Kru@@ g@@ man is a neo-@@ Key@@ ne@@ sian that te@@ aches at Princ@@ et@@ on University and he is a well-known leader writer of the New York Times .
Kru@@ g@@ man is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the Bush administration .
A few months after the attacks of September 2001 , in the days when En@@ ron was going bank@@ rupt , Kru@@ g@@ man had forec@@ ast@@ ed in an edi@@ torial published on the New York Times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first , in terms of its consequences on the history of the United States .
A pre@@ diction that started a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the econom@@ ist &apos;s face , but has now been revealed to have been exact .
« I am surprised and also a bit anno@@ yed by the speed with which rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tions of scand@@ als such as the collapse of En@@ ron or World@@ com have disappeared from public attention » , declared Kru@@ g@@ man towards the end of 2002 .
According to Lor@@ enzo B@@ ini S@@ ma@@ gh@@ i , of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank , Kru@@ g@@ man is an &quot; econom@@ ist of great value » , but also an or@@ ator with a &quot; very aggressive style , particularly critical of the exc@@ esses in liber@@ alism of the Bush administration » .
Open Office , here is the third edition of the &quot; anti-@@ Microsoft » package .
Today sees the release of Open@@ offic@@ e.@@ org 3.0 , the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users , from domestic to home users , from professionals to public administration , as a free alternative for the better known Microsoft Office .
After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunte@@ er developers , with S@@ UN Micro@@ system super@@ vising at their backs , the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various no@@ vel@@ ties : to the welcome screen and to a re@@ visited , less S@@ part@@ an user interface , are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format O@@ DF ( Open Docum@@ ent Format ) 1.2 , the latest ISO version standard .
At@@ tention was also placed on interoper@@ ability with the Office 2007 suite , Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension ( .@@ doc@@ x , .@@ x@@ l@@ s@@ x , .@@ pp@@ t@@ x ) .
Inter@@ esting are some functions specific to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of Power@@ Point presentations , useful for example for sending them via email , or the possibility of im@@ porting a PDF file into the graphics module , maintaining the original appearance of the page .
Al@@ ways on the same track , it is possible to create &quot; hybrid PDF &quot; documents , that join the standard graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a sp@@ read@@ sheet or a word processor .
Coll@@ abor@@ ation is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved : in the sp@@ read@@ sheet application several users can operate simultaneously , avoiding conflicts on the modifications , in the word processor , each users is assigned a comm@@ enting colour to improve recognition during revision .
Some companies are also working on porting some of the func@@ tion@@ alities of Open@@ Office onto the Web ( on the clou@@ d ) , and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product .
The Italian version is available for download at the address http : / / it@@ .@@ open@@ offic@@ e.@@ org / download / 3.@@ 0.@@ 0 / downlo@@ ad@@ 300@@ .@@ html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday .
Besides for Windows and Mac OS , as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system .
On request the installation c@@ d can be sent to your home or workplace .
And if the gi@@ mm@@ ick of free could be a driving force for the diff@@ u@@ sion into houses , it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools .
And there are even institutions that offer training services , consultancy , and assistance , ideal small to medium enterprises , which could create more business opportunities .
Open Office is composed of five main modules : Wri@@ ter , for on@@ screen typ@@ ing corresponding to Word ; Cal@@ c , the sp@@ read@@ sheet application aiming at sub@@ stit@@ uting Excel ; Im@@ press , for presentations in em@@ ulation of Power@@ point ; D@@ base , as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that con@@ s@@ ents working on databases ; Dra@@ w , is the graphic module .
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads , and considering that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand , with the release of the new version it is prob@@ able that the predic@@ ted figure could even be exceeded .
Even Koh@@ l tested positive , it is the fourth case of dop@@ ing
A new case of positive testing during the last Tour de France : it is the Austrian Bern@@ hard Koh@@ l , of the team Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer , third in classification and winner of the best gri@@ m@@ pe@@ ur shirt .
Re@@ porting the news is the daily newspaper L &apos;@@ Equi@@ pe .
The 26 year old Koh@@ l is the fourth cy@@ cli@@ st tested positive to C@@ era , the third generation EP@@ O , after the Itali@@ ans Ric@@ car@@ do Ric@@ c@@ ò and Leonardo Pie@@ pol@@ i , and the German Stefan Schu@@ macher , also from the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer team .
The analysis of the blood samples from Koh@@ l form part of those performed within the last few weeks by the labor@@ atories of Lo@@ s@@ anna and Ch@@ aten@@ a@@ y-@@ Mal@@ ab@@ ry .
If the counter-@@ analysis confirm the tests as positive to C@@ era , the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and faces the two-@@ year can@@ on@@ ical dis@@ qualification .
Con@@ fir@@ ming the news of Koh@@ l testing positive to the third generation Ep@@ o is the French anti-@@ dop@@ ing agency &apos;s chief , Pierre B@@ ord@@ ry who informed the Associ@@ ated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results .
The 26 year old Austrian had placed himself on the fin@@ alist po@@ dium behind the Spanish Carlos Sa@@ str@@ e and the American Ca@@ del Evans , also winning the pol@@ ka-@@ dot@@ ted shirt of the best gri@@ m@@ pe@@ ur .
IMM@@ IG@@ R@@ ANT@@ S : NEW YORK IS W@@ ON@@ DER@@ ING , IS IT@@ AL@@ Y R@@ AC@@ IS@@ T ?
Italy &quot; from a country of em@@ igrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants &quot; reluc@@ t@@ antly received .
Is this trans@@ forming the ‘ Bel@@ pa@@ ese &apos; into a nation of ra@@ ci@@ sts ? This is what is being ques@@ tioned in a long article in the New York Times , which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Ab@@ dul William Gui@@ bre originally from Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o killed last month in Milan for having st@@ olen a box of bis@@ cu@@ its .
This case proves what the New York Times calls the &quot; northern parado@@ x &quot; : the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is &quot; most integration and most work &quot; but also where there is &quot; the highest anti-@@ imm@@ igrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League &quot; .
As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Itali@@ ans and immigrants the N@@ Y@@ T has also c@@ ited the incidents of in@@ tolerance in Milan , Par@@ ma , Rome , Ci@@ amp@@ ino , and Cast@@ el Vol@@ tur@@ no .
Not only .
Even the new legislation from the League that tigh@@ tens the bra@@ kes on immigration and facilit@@ ates the exp@@ ul@@ sion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a para@@ dig@@ m of the change in climate in Italy .
A trend that has been highlighted by the P@@ ope as well as by the President of the Republic &quot; Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ poli@@ tano who meeting Ben@@ edi@@ ct X@@ VI at the Qu@@ ir@@ inal has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism &quot; .
Stu@@ dents victims of high r@@ ents up to 900 Euro for a room
The rent market for university students does not know crises .
According to the latest investigation by S@@ UN@@ IA , the ten@@ ants &apos; syn@@ dic@@ ate , r@@ enting a single room could cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan , 700 in Florence , 650 in Naples , 600 in Rome .
&quot; The phenomenon has now assumed a very serious trend ; up to the point that entire bands of young people are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living which their families would have to sustain – explains the executive from the Research Office of S@@ UN@@ IA , Lau@@ ra Mari@@ ani – in these cities the strong demand by the students has distor@@ ted the market so much as to start a process of general increase in rent even for residents &quot; .
In the majority of cases the r@@ ent-@@ offers contain a series of violations : fre@@ est@@ yle contracts , un@@ registered , without rent limits , connected su@@ ble@@ ases .
According to S@@ UN@@ IA special intervention is necessary that , through a revision of the taxes imposed , the prices could be cool@@ ed down .
Looking at the details of the investigation , one can see that in Milan , for a bed@@ -@@ space in the Bri@@ an@@ za zone , 450 Euro are required ; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 650 ( Black Band zone ) , to an average price of 800 ( L@@ ambi@@ ate zone , U@@ dine and F@@ ier@@ a ) , and on to a maximum of 900 ( Victoria zone ) .
In Florence a bed@@ -@@ space costs on average 350 / 400 Euro , a room approximately 700 .
In Bologna , where the students concentrate themselves in the areas closest to the university , 250 / 280 Euro are required for a bed@@ -@@ space in a double room , and from 3@@ 70 to 500 for a single .
In Rome in the zone near the central universities ( San Lor@@ enzo , Piazza Bologna ) approximately 600 Euro is the asking price for a single room , 450 Euro for a bed@@ -@@ space in a double room .
S@@ ligh@@ tly lower prices ( 5@@ 50 Euro for a single room ) in areas close to the other universities ( O@@ sti@@ ense and Cin@@ ec@@ it@@ tà ) .
Sav@@ ings are only possible by moving to the sub@@ ur@@ bs : 300 Euro for a bed@@ -@@ space and 450 for a single in areas such as P@@ ren@@ est@@ rin@@ a , Cent@@ oc@@ elle and similar places .
In Naples 300 / 450 Euro are required for a bed@@ -@@ space , for a single room one sp@@ ends 400 to 600 Euro , with the highest prices found in the Po@@ lic@@ lin@@ ico , V@@ om@@ ero , and Coll@@ i A@@ min@@ ei areas .
In Bar@@ i for a bed@@ -@@ space 250 / 350 Euro are required , at least 350 for a single .
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms , but they have a higher impact on the local economy .
In cities where r@@ enting to non-@@ EU students is a more frequent phenomenon , such as Peru@@ gia , there is a further an@@ om@@ al@@ y : the increase of about 25 / 30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from Italian students .
Goo@@ d@@ by@@ e old Cin@@ ema Par@@ adi@@ so , cities cancel historical theat@@ res
Histor@@ ical cin@@ em@@ at@@ ographic theat@@ res close in favour of Multi@@ ple@@ x .
&quot; A city without cin@@ em@@ at@@ ographic theat@@ res is a blind city , it &apos;s like a face without eyes &quot; .
The image offered by the director Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Tor@@ nat@@ ore eff@@ ic@@ aci@@ ously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provin@@ cial towns .
The sid@@ el@@ ining process of the cin@@ em@@ as , with the birth in the outs@@ kir@@ ts of large multi-@@ hall theat@@ res and the consequ@@ ent death by consumption of the single-@@ hall theat@@ res within the central areas of the city , is one of those events that appears un@@ avoid@@ able and in@@ contro@@ verti@@ ble and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime .
Frequ@@ ently , it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear , &quot; it is as if a friend is lost , an acqu@@ ain@@ tance with whom we have shared the way and many memories » , ob@@ serves the director of New Cin@@ ema Par@@ adise , the film that twenty years ago gave Tor@@ nat@@ ore the O@@ scar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes , and which nar@@ rated the po@@ em of a provin@@ cial hall and the no@@ stal@@ gia for a way of living the cinema which , perhaps , has been lost forever .
The numbers provided by A@@ ne@@ c , the main cin@@ em@@ a-@@ operators association , speak clearly : within the last five years 3@@ 16 traditional style cin@@ em@@ as have closed shop , and the ones to pay the price were above all the theat@@ res in the principal cities : 10 less in Florence , 9 in Milan , Naples , Bologna , and Rome , 6 less in Turin , 5 in Pal@@ ermo .
Among the regions most badly hit by the clo@@ sures , Em@@ ili@@ a-@@ Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-@@ hall cin@@ em@@ as lost , followed by Tuscany ( 44 ) , and by Lom@@ bar@@ dy ( 41 ) .
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multi@@ ple@@ x is the most responsible for their dis@@ appearance , these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multi@@ ple@@ x cin@@ em@@ as registered : 19@@ 5 more screens in Lom@@ bar@@ dy in the last five years , 81 in both Tuscany and Em@@ ili@@ a-@@ Romagna .
« The Italian business has developed in an ir@@ rational way » ob@@ serves Pa@@ olo Pro@@ tti , A@@ ne@@ c &apos;s president , &quot; it &apos;s useful that new structures are built but it &apos;s also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed , because once a theatre in a city clo@@ ses , not all its patron@@ s may be inc@@ lined to transfer to the multi@@ ple@@ xes .
Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators : the previous deb@@ it by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro .
It &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ceful , from the ethical and from the moral point of view , that the government does not respect the exist@@ ent laws .
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are required » .
An interesting example is that of Bologna , the first Italian city that , concerned by the clo@@ sures , has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and A@@ ne@@ c , the first of its kind in Italy , to protect and promote single-@@ hall cin@@ em@@ as both in the historical centre as well as on the outs@@ kir@@ ts .
Among the foreseen provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility : the spec@@ t@@ ators can enter in the traff@@ ic-@@ limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks .
« It &apos;s an initiative which I like » ob@@ serves Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Tor@@ nat@@ ore &quot; and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures .
It &apos;s certain though , that to contrast the excessive power of the multi@@ ple@@ x , traditional theat@@ res have also to improve the sound and image quality , because the public nowadays is more demanding .
The defence of traditional cin@@ em@@ as is a theme that for me has always been important : the closure of the Bag@@ her@@ ia Su@@ perc@@ in@@ ema , the place of my in@@ fan@@ cy and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence , was the spar@@ k that convinced me to create &quot; New Cin@@ ema Par@@ adi@@ so &quot; , on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years .
I have been living in Rome for 25 years , and when I pass in front of the Ri@@ alto or the Qu@@ ir@@ inal in National Street both closed by now , there where I have experienced many shared emotions , I turn away so as not to see the post@@ ers black@@ ened by the dust » .
T@@ ies between politics and ‘ n@@ d@@ ran@@ gh@@ eta arrested the may@@ or of Gi@@ o@@ ia Tau@@ ro
&quot; The may@@ or of Gi@@ o@@ ia Tau@@ ro was dis@@ posed towards con@@ forming municipal interests with those of the Pi@@ rom@@ all@@ i gang &quot; .
The accus@@ ations that the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ates of the Cal@@ ab@@ re@@ se Anti-@@ ma@@ fia Office direct against the may@@ or and the dep@@ uty may@@ or of Gi@@ o@@ ia Tau@@ ro Gi@@ or@@ gio D@@ al Tor@@ ri@@ one and Ros@@ ario Schi@@ av@@ one , and the may@@ or of Ros@@ ar@@ no Carlo Mart@@ elli , who have been arrested this morning for external contest with ma@@ fia association , are very serious .
Also arrested is Gi@@ o@@ ac@@ ch@@ ino Pi@@ rom@@ all@@ i , the senior medi@@ ator between the cl@@ an and the public administration offices , and his ne@@ p@@ he@@ w - a lawyer , nam@@ es@@ ake of the bo@@ ss , already condemned for ma@@ fi@@ a-@@ style criminal association , condemned to re@@ pay 10 million euro .
&quot; In con@@ temp@@ t of all judicial and moral rules , and common sense &quot; , write the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultancy fees to the lawyer Pi@@ rom@@ all@@ i .
&quot; In this way , it was allowed for the gang – the judges write – to officially penet@@ rate inside the municipality eas@@ ing the already vast possibilities of controlling and direc@@ ting the public administration &quot; .
The president of the Cal@@ ab@@ re@@ se local council Aga@@ zio Lo@@ ier@@ o does not hide that &quot; col@@ lu@@ sions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous &quot; within his region : &quot; there are areas where ma@@ fia presence is stronger and more intense than in others , where col@@ lu@@ sion is almost inevitable .
However , there are many local politicians who resist the pressure put on by the &apos; n@@ d@@ ran@@ gh@@ eta , her@@ oes who remain clean &quot; .
This morning &apos;s arre@@ sts follow those in July with which the police announced to have be@@ headed the Pi@@ rom@@ all@@ i gang .
At the end of last April , the municipal council of Gi@@ o@@ ia Tau@@ ro was dis@@ solved but already in 1991 , and always for pre@@ sum@@ ed conditioning between organised crime and local administration , local politicians had been relie@@ ved from duties of administration of the municipality .
Gi@@ or@@ gio D@@ al Tor@@ ri@@ one , the may@@ or of U@@ DC at the time of the dis@@ solution , had been elected head of a cent@@ re-@@ right coalition , after the May 2006 bal@@ lot .
He made a scandal out of it when the Pre@@ fec@@ ture ordered the dis@@ solution of the municipal council .
He brought in cause the then vic@@ e-@@ minister of the Inter@@ ior Marco M@@ inn@@ iti acc@@ using him of having p@@ lot@@ ted everything for political mo@@ tives , however the judges , in the arrest warrant signed this morning , have explained that the Pi@@ rom@@ all@@ i gang had even arrived at asking for the vari@@ ation of the A@@ 3 project .
From the inter@@ cep@@ tions ordered on D@@ al Tor@@ ri@@ one , writes the public prosec@@ ution , has emerged &quot; a willingness to mar@@ ry the needs of an entrepren@@ eur , representative of a larger group not@@ ori@@ ously close to the Pi@@ rom@@ all@@ i , align@@ ing the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang &quot; .
When energy is born from the waves the big come into play
It &apos;s an immense body , that occup@@ ies 70 % of the planet &apos;s surface and now the big , international energy companies are discovering it .
W@@ aves , curr@@ ents , ti@@ des are the new renewable sources being e@@ yed , and subjected to attempts of development , by colo@@ ssi such as Che@@ v@@ ron .
The possibility of extrac@@ ting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70 &apos;s , coinci@@ ding with the first oil crisis , research was intensi@@ fied .
When the oil prices went down , around 1980 , the idea of explo@@ iting marine energy was put aside , but now the appe@@ als by the environment@@ alists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector .
The World Energy Council ( W@@ EC ) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world &apos;s electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas &apos; und@@ ul@@ ating motion .
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations .
And then there would be the curr@@ ents and the ti@@ des .
Colo@@ ssi on the attack .
The first company to bet on marine energy was En@@ er@@ sis , which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal .
When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step .
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these , there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy .
&quot; Che@@ v@@ ron is resear@@ ching technologies for o@@ ce@@ an@@ ic energy – a spo@@ kes@@ person for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal – and is evalu@@ ating the possibility of collabor@@ ating with us &quot; .
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission , necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Al@@ as@@ ka .
This is a significant sign , especially if one considers that right in Al@@ as@@ ka the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new dri@@ lling .
Besides Che@@ v@@ ron there are Ver@@ d@@ ant Power Inc . Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jer@@ sey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far , even though they are not known in detail , indicate according to the observers an increasing interest .
Technology to be made ready .
Exper@@ ts talk about a technology still in its in@@ fan@@ cy , marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact .
T@@ ill now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the eco@@ system .
To produce energy on a large scale , however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented .
And the choices are varied : Ocean Power , for example , uses a system of bu@@ o@@ ys connected between themselves .
The thr@@ ust of the waves , which makes the bu@@ o@@ ys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pist@@ ons and cy@@ lin@@ ders inside the flo@@ aters .
The pressure turns a tur@@ b@@ ine which in its turn fuels a generator .
The electricity is sent to shore through under@@ water c@@ ables .
For now there are four plants of this kind being planned , waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation .
Ver@@ d@@ ant Power , on the other hand , already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six under@@ water tur@@ bin@@ es in New York &apos;s East River .
The water movement when there are the sea ti@@ des makes the fans of the tur@@ bin@@ es go round , creating a ro@@ tary motion that powers a generator .
Ver@@ d@@ ant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary author@@ is@@ ations to benefit from the energy .
After the waves , the ti@@ des .
Partic@@ ular interest , declare the people at the Electri@@ cal Energy Research Institute , is deser@@ ved at the moment by the potential of ti@@ des .
Even though it is an inter@@ mitt@@ ent phenomenon , the ti@@ de is more predictable than the wind , the sun , or the waves , and so is more reliable as a source of energy .
It &apos;s exactly on ti@@ dal energy that states such as New York , Ma@@ ine , and Al@@ as@@ ka , together with others that over@@ look the coast , have already invested 7.@@ 5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009 .
