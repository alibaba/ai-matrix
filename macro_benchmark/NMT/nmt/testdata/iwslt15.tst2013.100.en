When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To Envy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so shocked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
Soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t erase from my memory .
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s .
Ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
This is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
After they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer .
He took everyone &apos;s I.D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
As the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning .
He looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
We made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
After I paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .
I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
Eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
He &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
Remi knows what love is .
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
He &apos;s not greedy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .
When he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
