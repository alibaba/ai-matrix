Thanks to the author. The code is downloaded from https://github.com/guoyang9/NCF 

This code only covers the Movielens 1M Dataset https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.  
Based on the paper's result, the improvement of with pre-train over without pre-train is not too significant, so this version is just the NCF with the intergration of GMF and MLP.  
  
Please run with   
bash train.sh
